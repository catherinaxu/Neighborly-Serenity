account in determining certain income and earnings. In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Refunding Bonds is exempt from
California personal income taxes. Interest on the Series 2014B Bonds is subject to federal income taxation. See “TAX MATTERS” herein.

and interest on the Refunding Bonds covered thereby (see “POSSIBLE BOND INSURANCE” herein). The District’s decision whether or not to
obtain such a policy will be made at or about the time of pricing of the Refunding Bonds and will be based upon, among other things, market
conditions at the time of such pricing. No assurance can be given as to whether the District will obtain such a policy, and, if so, whether such

ONLY SYSTEM.”

Payment of Principal and Interest

The Refunding Bonds shall be dated the date of their delivery, and shall bear interest at the rates
set forth in the table on the inside cover page hereof, payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year,
commencing on February 1, 2015 (each an “Interest Payment Date”), calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The Refunding Bond shall be issued in denominations of
$5,000 or any integral multiples thereof, and shall bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next
preceding the date of authentication thereof unless it is authenticated as of a date during the period from
the 15th calendar day of the month immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date whether or not
such day is a business day (each, a “Record Date”) to such Interest Payment Date, inclusive, in which
event it shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date, or unless it is authenticated on or before the
Record Date preceding the first Interest Payment Date for such Refunding Bonds, in which event it shall
bear interest from its dated date; provided, however, that if, at the time of authentication of any Refunding
Bond, interest is in default on any outstanding Refunding Bonds, such Refunding Bond shall bear interest
from the Interest Payment Date to which interest has previously been paid or made available for payment
on the outstanding Refunding Bonds.

Interest on the Refunding Bonds shall be paid in lawful money of the United States on each
Interest Payment Date. Interest shall be paid by check of the Paying Agent mailed on each Interest
Payment Date (if a business day, or on the next business day if the Interest Payment Date does not fall on
a business day) to the registered owners thereof (the “Owners”) as of the Record Date preceding such
Interest Payment Date at their respective addresses shown on the registration books (the “Registration
Books”) maintained by the Paying Agent or at such address as the Owner may have filed with the Paying
Agent for that purpose, except that the payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to any Owner of at least $1,000,000 of outstanding Refunding Bonds who shall have requested in
writing such method of payment of interest prior to the close of business on the Record Date immediately
preceding any Interest Payment Date.

The principal of the Refunding Bonds is payable in lawful money of the United States of America
upon the surrender thereof at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent at the maturity
thereof or upon redemption prior to maturity. So long as the Refunding Bonds are held by Cede & Co., as
nominee of DTC, payment shall be made by wire transfer. See APPENDIX F − “BOOK-ENTRY ONLY 
SYSTEM.”

Agent shall select the outstanding Series 2014A Refunding Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed by lot.

Notice of Redemption. Notice of any redemption of the Series 2014A Refunding Bonds shall be
mailed by the Paying Agent, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the

date; and (xi) in the case of a conditional notice,
that such notice is conditioned upon certain
circumstances and the manner of rescinding such conditional notice. The actual receipt by the Owner of
any Series 2014A Refunding Bond or by any securities depository or information service of notice of
redemption shall not be a condition precedent to redemption, and failure to receive such notice, or any
defect in the notice given, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of such Series
2014A Refunding Bonds or the cessation of interest on the date fixed for redemption.

Effect of Notice of Redemption. When notice of redemption has been given substantially as
described above and when the redemption price of the Series 2014A Refunding Bonds called for
redemption is set aside, the Series 2014A Refunding Bonds designated for redemption shall become due
and payable on the specified redemption date and interest shall cease to accrue thereon as of the
redemption date, and upon presentation and surrender of such Series 2014A Refunding Bonds at the place
specified in the notice of redemption, such Series 2014A Refunding Bonds shall be redeemed and paid at
the redemption price thereof out of the money provided therefor. The Owners of such Series 2014A
Refunding Bonds so called for redemption after such redemption date shall look for the payment of such
Series 2014A Refunding Bonds and the redemption premium thereon, if any, only to moneys on deposit
for the purpose in the interest and sinking fund of the District within the County treasury (the “Interest
and Sinking Fund”) or the trust fund established for such purpose. All Series 2014A Refunding Bonds
redeemed shall be cancelled forthwith by the Paying Agent and shall not be reissued.

Right to Rescind Notice. The District may rescind any optional redemption and notice thereof for
any reason on any date prior to the date fixed for redemption by causing written notice of the rescission to
be given to the owners of the Series 2014A Refunding Bonds so called for redemption. Any optional
redemption and notice thereof shall be rescinded if for any reason on the date fixed for redemption
moneys are not available in the Interest and Sinking Fund of the District or otherwise held in trust for
such purpose in an amount sufficient to pay in full on said date the principal of, interest, and any premium
due on the Series 2014A Refunding Bonds called for redemption. Notice of rescission of redemption shall
be given in the same manner in which notice of redemption was originally given. The actual receipt by
the owner of any Series 2014A Refunding Bond of notice of such rescission shall not be a condition
precedent to rescission, and failure to receive such notice or any defect in such notice shall not affect the
validity of the rescission.

Defeasance

The District may pay and discharge any or all of the Refunding Bonds by depositing in trust with
the Paying Agent or an escrow agent at or before maturity, money and/or non-callable direct obligations
of the United States of America (including zero interest bearing State and Local Government Series) or
other non-callable obligations the payment of the principal of and interest on which is guaranteed by a
pledge of the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in an amount which will, together with
the interest to accrue thereon and available moneys then on deposit in the Interest and Sinking Fund of the
District, be fully sufficient to pay and discharge the indebtedness on such Refunding Bonds (including all
principal, interest and redemption premiums) at or before their respective maturity dates.

Unclaimed Moneys

Any money held in any fund created pursuant to the Resolution or by the Paying Agent or an
escrow agent in trust for the payment of the principal of, redemption premium, if any, or interest on
Refunding Bonds and remaining unclaimed for two years after the principal of all of such Refunding
Bonds has become due and payable (whether by maturity or upon prior redemption) shall be transferred to
the Interest and Sinking Fund of the District for payment of any outstanding bonds of the District payable
from said fund; or, if no such bonds of the District are at such time outstanding, said moneys shall be
transferred to the general fund of the District as provided and permitted by law.

Outstanding Bonds; Plan of Finance

Outstanding Bonds.

In addition to the Refunding Bonds, the District has eight additional
outstanding series of bonds, each of which is secured by ad valorem taxes upon all property subject to
taxation by the District, and a series of bond anticipation notes.

In March 30, 2000, the District issued its 2000 General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series A in
the aggregate principal amount of $22,060,000 (the “Series 2000A Refunding Bonds”). The proceeds of
the Series 2000A Refunding Bonds were used to advance refund the District’s General Obligation Bonds,
Election 1995, Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D.

On August 16, 2005 the Golden West Schools Financing Authority (“GWSFA”) issued its 2005

$5,660,000 (the “GWSFA Bonds”) to provide funds to advance refund the District’s General Obligation
Bonds, Election of 1995, Series E (the “Series 1995E Bonds”). Concurrently, the District issued its
$5,045,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2005 General Obligation Refunding Bonds (the “Series
2005 Refunding Bonds”) as replacement bonds, which are privately held bonds. The revenue from the
Series 2005 Refunding Bonds is pledged to pay the principal of and interest on the GWSFA Bonds. The
final maturity of both series of bonds is August 1, 2030.

On November 7, 2006, over 55% of the registered voters of the District received authorization to
issue bonds of the District in an aggregate principal amount of $136,900,000 (the “2006 Authorization”).
On May 9, 2007, the District issued its General Obligation Bonds, 2006 Election, Series A (the “Series
2006A Bonds”) in the aggregate principal amount of $50,000,000, which was the District’s first series of
bonds to be issued under the 2006 Authorization. On July, 23, 2009, the District issued its General
Obligation Bonds, Series 2006 Election, Series B (the “Series 2006B Bonds”) in the aggregate initial
principal amount of $17,998,936.60, which was the District’s second series of bonds to be issued under
the 2006 Authorization. On April 29, 2010, the District issued its General Obligation Bonds, 2006
Election, Series C (the “Series 2006C Bonds”) in the aggregate principal amount of $12,000,000, which
was the District’s third series of bonds to be issued under the 2006 Authorization. On February 1, 2011,
the District issued the Series 2006D Bonds in the aggregate initial principal amount of $14,999,736.85,
which was the District’s fourth series of bonds to be issued under the 2006 Authorization. On June 16,
2011, in anticipation of issuing additional bonds under the 2006 Authorization, the District issued its 2011
Taxable Bond Anticipation Notes (Direct-Pay Qualified School Construction Bonds) (the “Series 2011
BANs”) in the aggregate principal amount of $4,860,000. The Series 2011 BANs mature on June 1,

the District

On November 6, 2012, over 55% of the registered voters of the District received reauthorization
to issue bonds of
in an aggregate principal amount of $41,900,000 (the “2012
Reauthorization”). On May 9, 2013, the District issued $35,540,000 aggregate principal amount of its
General Obligation Bonds, 2012 Election, Series A (GO Reauthorization Bonds) (the “Series 2012A
Bonds”) as its first series of bonds issued under the 2012 Reauthorization. On June 27, 2013, the District
issued its 2012 General Obligation Ed-Tech Bonds, Series B (the “Series 2012B Bonds”), in the
aggregate principal amount of $1,500,000 for the purpose of financing technology projects.

At the November 2014 election, the registered voters of the District will be voting on a
proposition to authorize the District to issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount of $133,000,000.
The District cannot make any representations as to whether the District’s bond proposition will be
approved by the voters at the November 2014 election.

Plan of Finance. The District has engaged Barclays Capital, Inc. and Raymond James &
Associates, Inc., as repurchase agents (the “Repurchase Agents”), to purchase all or portions of the Series
2006D Bonds through privately negotiated open market purchases. The District expects to issue the
Refunding Bonds, in part, to fund the purchase of such purchased Series 2006D Bonds (the “Repurchased
Bonds”), as further described in the table below, from the Repurchase Agents on the date of issuance of
the Refunding Bonds. Upon such purchase, the Repurchased Bonds will be cancelled. The District has
also decided to refund a portion of the Series 2006D Bonds (not purchased by the Repurchase Agents)
(the “Refunded Bonds” and, together with the Repurchased Bonds, the “Prior Bonds”), as further

6

described in the table below, using the optional redemption provisions applicable to the Series 2006D
Bonds. Accordingly, the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds will be issued (i) to purchase, on a current
basis, the Repurchased Bonds, (ii) to refund, on an advance basis, the Refunded Bonds, (iii) to fund
capitalized interest on the Refunding Bonds through August 1, 2015, and (iv) to pay certain costs of
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.  See “− Estimated Sources and Uses of Funds” below.

The District and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as escrow bank (the
“Escrow Bank”) will enter into an Escrow Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2014, with respect to the
Refunded Bonds (the “Escrow Agreement”), pursuant to which the District will deposit a portion of the
proceeds from the sale of the Refunding Bonds into a special fund to be held by the Escrow Bank. The
amounts deposited with the Escrow Bank with respect to the Refunded Bonds will be used to purchase
certain United States governmental obligations and/or other obligations the timely payment of which is
directly or indirectly guaranteed by the faith and credit of the United States of America, the principal of
and interest on which (together with any uninvested amount) will be sufficient to enable the Escrow Bank
to redeem the Refunded Bonds at a redemption price equal to 100% of the accreted value of the Refunded
Bonds on their first optional redemption date (August 1, 2021). See “ESCROW VERIFICATION”
herein. As a result of the deposit and investment of funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the
Refunded Bonds will be legally defeased on the date of original delivery of the Refunding Bonds, and
will be payable solely from amounts held by the Escrow Bank for that purpose under the Escrow
Agreement.

The Refunding Bonds are payable from ad valorem taxes to be levied within the District pursuant
to the California Constitution and other State law. The Board of Supervisors of the County is empowered
and obligated to levy ad valorem taxes upon all property subject to taxation by the District, without
limitation as to rate or amount (except as to certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates),
for the payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds. The proceeds of the levy shall be
deposited to the credit of the interest and sinking fund of the District within the County treasury (the
“Interest and Sinking Fund”). Such proceeds shall be applied for the payment of principal of and interest
on the Refunding Bonds. Moneys in the Interest and Sinking Fund will be invested on behalf of the
District in any one or more investments generally permitted to school districts authorized pursuant to
Section 53601 et seq. or Section 53635 et seq. of the California Government Code by the County
Treasurer, and consistent with the investment policy of the County. See APPENDIX E – “SAN MATEO

SECURITY AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE REFUNDING BONDS

General

In order to provide sufficient funds for repayment of principal and interest when due on a school
district’s bonds, the board of supervisors of the county, the superintendent of schools of which has
jurisdiction over such school district, is empowered and is obligated to levy ad valorem taxes upon all
property subject to taxation by such school district, without limitation as to rate or amount (except as to
certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates). Such taxes are in addition to other taxes levied
upon property within the school district. The assessor of the county in which the school district lies must
annually certify to the board of supervisors the assessed value of all taxable property in the county
situated in the school district. The board of supervisors must levy upon the property of the school district
within its own county the rate of tax that will be sufficient to raise not less than the amount needed to pay
the interest and any portion of the principal of the bonds that is to become due during the year.

Accordingly, the Board of Supervisors of the County must levy upon the property of the District
the rate of tax that will be sufficient to provide sufficient funds for repayment of principal and interest
when due on the Refunding Bonds. When collected, the tax revenues will be deposited in the District’s
Interest and Sinking Fund, which is required to be maintained by the County and to be used solely for the
payment of bonds of the District. Moneys in the Interest and Sinking Fund will be invested on behalf of
the District in any one or more investments generally permitted to school districts authorized pursuant to
Section 53601 et seq. or Section 53635 et seq. of the California Government Code by the County
Treasurer, and consistent with the investment policy of the County. See APPENDIX E – “SAN MATEO
COUNTY INVESTMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES; DESCRIPTION OF INVESTMENT POOL.”

Property Taxation System

Property tax revenues result from the application of the appropriate tax rate to the total assessed
value of taxable property in the District. School districts receive property taxes for payment of voter-
approved bonds as well as for general operating purposes.

Local property taxation is the responsibility of various county officers. For each school district
located in a county, the county assessor computes the value of locally assessed taxable property. Based on
the assessed value of property and the scheduled debt service on outstanding bonds in each year, the
county auditor-controller computes the rate of tax necessary to pay such debt service, and presents the tax
rolls (including rates of tax for all taxing jurisdictions in the county) to the county board of supervisors
for approval. The county treasurer and tax collector prepares and mails tax bills to taxpayers and collects
the taxes. In addition, the treasurer and tax collector, as ex officio treasurer of each school district located
in the county, holds school district funds, including taxes collected for payment of school bonds, and is
charged with payment of principal and interest on the bonds when due.

Assessed Valuation of Property Within the District

Taxable property located in the District had a 2013-14 assessed value of $15,559,024,889 and has
a 2014-15 assessed value of $16,243,490,284. All property (real, personal and intangible) is taxable
unless an exemption is granted by the California Constitution or United States law. Under the State
Constitution, exempt classes of property include household and personal effects, intangible personal
property (such as bank accounts, stocks and bonds), business inventories, and property used for religious,
hospital, scientific and charitable purposes. The State Legislature may create additional exemptions for
personal property, but not for real property. Most taxable property is assessed by the assessor of the
county in which the property is located. Some special classes of property are assessed by the State Board
of Equalization.

Taxes are levied for each fiscal year on taxable real and personal property assessed as of the
preceding January 1, at which time the lien attaches. The assessed value is required to be adjusted during
the course of the year when property changes ownership or new construction is completed. State law also
affords an appeal procedure to taxpayers who disagree with the assessed value of any property. When
necessitated by changes in assessed value during the course of a year, a supplemental assessment is
prepared so that taxes can be levied on the new assessed value before the next regular assessment roll is
completed. See “−Appeals of Assessed Valuation; Blanket Reductions of Assessed Values” below.

Under the State Constitution, the State Board of Equalization assesses property of State-regulated
transportation and communications utilities, including railways, telephone and telegraph companies, and
companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity. The Board of Equalization also is required to assess
pipelines, flumes, canals and aqueducts lying within two or more counties. The value of property assessed
by the Board of Equalization is allocated by a formula to local jurisdictions in the county, including
school districts, and taxed by the local county tax officials in the same manner as for locally assessed
property. Taxes on privately owned railway cars, however, are levied and collected directly by the Board
of Equalization. Property used in the generation of electricity by a company that does not also transmit or
sell that electricity is taxed locally instead of by the Board of Equalization. Thus, the reorganization of
regulated utilities and the transfer of electricity-generating property to non-utility companies, as often
occurred under electric power deregulation in California, affects how those assets are assessed, and which
local agencies benefit from the property taxes derived. In general, the transfer of State-assessed property
located in the District to non-utility companies will increase the assessed value of property in the District,
since the property’s value will no longer be divided among all taxing jurisdictions in the County. The
transfer of property located and taxed in the District to a State-assessed utility will have the opposite
effect: generally reducing the assessed value in the District, as the value is shared among the other

12

jurisdictions in the County. The District is unable to predict future transfers of State-assessed property in
the District and the County, the impact of such transfers on its utility property tax revenues, or whether
future legislation or litigation may affect ownership of utility assets, the State’s methods of assessing
utility property, or the method by which tax revenues of utility property is allocated to local taxing
agencies, including the District.

Locally taxed property is classified either as “secured” or “unsecured,” and is listed accordingly
on separate parts of the assessment roll. The “secured roll” is that part of the assessment roll containing
State-assessed property and property (real or personal) for which there is a lien on real property sufficient,
in the opinion of the county assessor, to secure payment of the taxes. All other property is “unsecured,”
and is assessed on the “unsecured roll.” Secured property assessed by the State Board of Equalization is
commonly identified for taxation purposes as “utility” property.

Shown in the following table is the assessed valuation of the various classes of property in the

District for recent fiscal years.

Valuation

Assessments may be adjusted during the course of the year when real property changes ownership
or new construction is completed. Assessments may also be appealed by taxpayers seeking a reduction as
a result of economic and other factors beyond the District’s control, such as a general market decline in
land values, reclassification of property to a class exempt from taxation, whether by ownership or use
(such as exemptions for property owned by State and local agencies and property used for qualified
educational, hospital, charitable or religious purposes), or the complete or partial destruction of taxable
property caused by natural or manmade disaster, such as earthquake, flood, fire, toxic dumping, etc.
When necessitated by changes in assessed value in the course of a year, taxes are pro-rated for each
portion of the tax year. See also “−Appeals  of  Assessed  Valuation;  Blanket  Reductions  of  Assessed 
Values” below.

Appeals of Assessed Valuation; Blanket Reductions of Assessed Values. There are two basic
types of property tax assessment appeals provided for under State law. The first type of appeal, commonly
referred to as a base year assessment appeal, involves a dispute on the valuation assigned by the assessor
immediately subsequent to an instance of a change in ownership or completion of new construction. If the
base year value assigned by the assessor is reduced, the valuation of the property cannot increase in
subsequent years more than 2% annually unless and until another change in ownership and/or additional
new construction or reconstruction activity occurs.

The second type of appeal, commonly referred to as a Proposition 8 appeal (which Proposition 8
was approved by the voters in 1978), can result if factors occur causing a decline in the market value of

13

the property to a level below the property’s then current taxable value (escalated base year value).
Pursuant to State law, a property owner may apply for a Proposition 8 reduction of the property tax
assessment for such owner’s property by filing a written application, in the form prescribed by the State
Board of Equalization, with the appropriate county board of equalization or assessment appeals board. A
property owner desiring a Proposition 8 reduction of the assessed value of such owner’s property in any
one year must submit an application to the county assessment appeals board (the “Appeals Board”).
Following a review of the application by the county assessor’s office, the county assessor may offer to the
property owner the opportunity to stipulate to a reduced assessment, or may confirm the assessment. If no
stipulation is agreed to, and the applicant elects to pursue the appeal, the matter is brought before the
Appeals Board (or, in some cases, a hearing examiner) for a hearing and decision. The Appeals Board
generally is required to determine the outcome of appeals within two years of each appeal’s filing date.
Any reduction in the assessment ultimately granted applies only to the year for which application is made
and during which the written application is filed. The assessed value increases to its pre-reduction level
(escalated to the inflation rate of no more than 2%) following the year for which the reduction application
is filed. However, the county assessor has the power to grant a reduction not only for the year for which
application was originally made, but also for the then current year and any intervening years as well. In
practice, such a reduced assessment may and often does remain in effect beyond the year in which it is
granted.

In addition, Article XIIIA of the State Constitution provides that the full cash value base of real
property used in determining taxable value may be adjusted from year to year to reflect the inflationary
rate, not to exceed a 2% increase for any given year, or may be reduced to reflect a reduction in the
consumer price index or comparable local data. This measure is computed on a calendar year basis.
According to representatives of the County assessor’s office, the County has in the past, pursuant to
Article XIIIA of the State Constitution, ordered blanket reductions of assessed property values and
corresponding property tax bills on single family residential properties when the value of the property has
declined below the current assessed value as calculated by the County.

No assurance can be given that property tax appeals and/or blanket reductions of assessed
property values will not significantly reduce the assessed valuation of property within the District in the
future.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION RELATING TO THE DISTRICT’S OPERATIONS
AND BUDGET – CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT
REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS – Limitations on Revenues” for a discussion of other limitations
on the valuation of real property with respect to ad valorem taxes.

Bonding Capacity. As a high school district, the District may issue bonds in an amount up to
1.25% of the assessed valuation of taxable property within its boundaries. The District’s fiscal year 2014-
15 gross bonding capacity (also commonly referred to as the “bonding limit” or “debt limit”) is
approximately $203 million and its net bonding capacity is approximately $58.9 million (taking into
account current outstanding debt before issuance of the Refunding Bonds and the refunding of the Prior
Bonds). Refunding Bonds may be issued without regard to this limitation; however, once issued, the
outstanding principal of any refunding bonds is included when calculating the District’s bonding capacity.

The more property (by assessed value) owned by a single taxpayer, the more tax collections are
exposed to weakness in the taxpayer’s financial situation and ability or willingness to pay property taxes.
Furthermore, assessments may be appealed by taxpayers seeking a reduction as a result of economic and
other factors beyond the District’s control.

Tax Rates

The State Constitution permits the levy of an ad valorem tax on taxable property not to exceed
1% of the full cash value of the property, and State law requires the full 1% tax to be levied. The levy of
special ad valorem property taxes in excess of the 1% levy is permitted as necessary to provide for debt
service payments on school bonds and other voter-approved indebtedness.

The rate of tax necessary to pay fixed debt service on the Refunding Bonds in a given year
depends on the assessed value of taxable property in that year. The rate of tax imposed on unsecured
property for repayment of the Refunding Bonds is based on the prior year’s secured property tax rate.
Economic and other factors beyond the District’s control, such as a general market decline in land values,
reclassification of property to a class exempt from taxation, whether by ownership or use (such as
exemptions for property owned by State and local agencies and property used for qualified educational,
hospital, charitable or religious purposes), or the complete or partial destruction of taxable property
caused by natural or manmade disaster, such as earthquake, flood, fire, toxic dumping, etc., could cause a

17

reduction in the assessed value of taxable property within the District and necessitate a corresponding
increase in the annual tax rate to be levied to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds.
Issuance of additional authorized bonds in the future might also cause the tax rate to increase.

Typical Tax Rate Area. The following table shows ad valorem property tax rates for the last five
fiscal years in a typical Tax Rate Area of the District (TRA 5-001). TRA 5-001 comprises approximately
17.06% of the total fiscal year 2013-14 assessed value of the District.

Tax Charges and Delinquencies

A school district’s share of the 1% countywide tax is based on the actual allocation of property
tax revenues to each taxing jurisdiction in the county in fiscal year 1978-79, as adjusted according to a
complicated statutory scheme enacted since that time. Revenues derived from special ad valorem taxes
for voter-approved indebtedness, including the Refunding Bonds, are reserved to the taxing jurisdiction
that approved and issued the debt, and may only be used to repay that debt.

The County Treasurer and tax collector prepares the property tax bills. Property taxes on the
regular secured assessment roll are due in two equal installments: the first installment is due on November
1, and becomes delinquent after December 10. The second installment is due on February 1 and becomes
delinquent after April 10. If taxes are not paid by the delinquent date, a 10% penalty attaches and a $40
cost is added to unpaid second installments. If taxes remain unpaid by June 30, the tax is deemed to be in
default, and a $15 state redemption fee applies. Interest then begins to accrue at the rate of 1.5% per
month. The property owner has the right to redeem the property by paying the taxes, accrued penalties,
and costs within five years of the date the property went into default. If the property is not redeemed
within five years, it is subject to sale at a public auction by the County Treasurer.

Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due in one payment on the lien date, January 1, and
become delinquent after August 31. A 10% penalty attaches to delinquent taxes on property on the
unsecured roll, and additional penalty of 1.5% per month begins to accrue on November 1. To collect
unpaid taxes, the County Treasurer may obtain a judgment lien upon and cause the sale of all property
owned by the taxpayer in the County, and may seize and sell personal property, improvements and
possessory interests of the taxpayer. The County Treasurer may also bring a civil suit against the
taxpayer for payment. The date on which taxes on supplemental assessments are due depends on when
the supplemental tax bill is mailed.

Teeter Plan. The County has adopted the Alternative Method of Distribution of Tax Levies and
Collections and of Tax Sale Proceeds (the “Teeter Plan”), as provided for in Section 4701 and following
of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. Under the Teeter Plan, each participating local agency
levying property taxes in the County, including the District, receives the full amount of uncollected taxes

credited to its fund (including delinquent taxes, if any), in the same manner as if the full amount due from
taxpayers had been collected. In return, the County receives and retains delinquent payments, penalties
and interest as collected, that would have been due the local agency. The County applies the Teeter Plan
to taxes levied for repayment of school district bonds.

The Teeter Plan is to remain in effect unless the County Board of Supervisors orders its
discontinuance or unless, prior to the commencement of any fiscal year of the County (which commences
on July 1), the Board of Supervisors receives a petition for its discontinuance from two-thirds of the
participating revenue districts in the County. The Board of Supervisors may also, after holding a public
hearing on the matter, discontinue the Teeter Plan with respect to any tax levying agency or assessment
levying agency in the County if the rate of secured tax delinquency in that agency in any year exceeds 3%
of the total of all taxes and assessments levied on the secured roll in that agency.

Notwithstanding that the County is on the Teeter Plan, below is information regarding historical

secured tax charges and delinquencies with the respect to the levy for debt service on bonds.

Direct and Overlapping Debt

Set forth below is a schedule of direct and overlapping debt prepared by California Municipal
Statistics Inc. effective August 1, 2014. The table is included for general information purposes only. The
District has not reviewed this table for completeness or accuracy and makes no representations in
connection therewith. The first column in the table names each public agency which has outstanding debt
as of the date of the schedule and whose territory overlaps the District in whole or in part. Column two
shows the percentage of each overlapping agency’s assessed value located within the boundaries of the
District. This percentage, multiplied by the total outstanding debt of each overlapping agency (which is
not shown in the table) produces the amount shown in column three, which is the apportionment of each
overlapping agency’s outstanding debt to taxable property in the District.

The schedule generally includes long-term obligations sold in the public credit markets by public
agencies whose boundaries overlap the boundaries of the District. Such long-term obligations generally
are not payable from revenues of the District (except as indicated) nor are they necessarily obligations
secured by land within the District. In many cases, long-term obligations issued by a public agency are
payable only from the general fund or other revenues of such public agency.

POSSIBLE BOND INSURANCE

The District may obtain a municipal bond insurance policy (the “Policy”) from Build America
Mutual Assurance Company pursuant to a commitment that has been issued by BAM to the District. The
policy, if obtained, would guarantee the scheduled payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding
Bonds covered thereby, as more fully described below. No assurance can be given as to (a) whether the
District will decide to obtain the Policy from BAM in connection with the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds, or (b) whether the District will insure all or less than all of the Refunding Bonds. The decision as
to whether or not the Policy will be obtained from BAM with respect to all or a portion of the Refunding
Bonds will be made at or about the time of the pricing of the Refunding Bonds and will be based upon,
among other things, market conditions existing at such time. If the District does decide to obtain the
Policy from BAM, it will be a condition to the issuance of the Refunding Bonds that such policy be issued
concurrently with the issuance of the Refunding Bonds. Any such Refunding Bonds that are so insured are
hereinafter referred to as the “Insured Bonds.”

There follows under this caption certain information concerning the terms of the Policy and BAM
that has been supplied by BAM for inclusion in this Preliminary Official Statement. No representation is
made by the District as to the accuracy, completeness or adequacy of such information, nor as to the
absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date of this Preliminary
Official Statement. The District has not made any independent investigation of BAM or the Policy, and
reference is made to the information set forth below and in Appendix G hereto for a description thereof.

The following information and the specimen of the Policy attached as Appendix G hereto have

been furnished by BAM for use in this Preliminary Official Statement.

guarantees scheduled principal and scheduled interest payments payable by the issuer of
the Insured Bonds on the date(s) when such amounts were initially scheduled to become
due and payable (subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Policy), and BAM
does not guarantee the market price or liquidity of the Insured Bonds, nor does it
guarantee that the rating on the Insured Bonds will not be revised or withdrawn.

underwriter for the Refunding Bonds, and the issuer and underwriter assume no
responsibility for their content.

BAM receives compensation (an insurance premium) for the insurance that it is
providing with respect to the Refunding Bonds. Neither BAM nor any affiliate of BAM
has purchased, or committed to purchase, any of the Refunding Bonds, whether at the
initial offering or otherwise

TAX MATTERS

Federal Tax Status. In the opinion of Bond Counsel, subject, however to certain qualifications
set forth below, under existing law, the interest on the Series 2014A Refunding Bonds is excluded from
gross income for federal income tax purposes, and such interest is not an item of tax preference for
purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations, although for
the purpose of computing the alternative minimum tax imposed on certain corporations, such interest is
taken into account in determining certain income and earnings.

The opinions set forth in the preceding paragraph are subject to the condition that the District
comply with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Tax Code”) that
must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Series 2014A Refunding Bonds in order that such
interest be, or continue to be, excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The District
has covenanted to comply with each such requirement.
Failure to comply with certain of such
requirements may cause the inclusion of such interest in gross income for federal income tax purposes to
be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Series 2014A Refunding Bonds.

Interest on the Series 2014B Refunding Bonds is not excludable from gross income for federal

income tax purposes and therefore is subject to federal income taxation.

Tax Treatment of Original Issue Discount and Premium.

If the initial offering price to the
public (excluding bond houses and brokers) at which a Series 2014A Refunding Bond is sold is less than
the amount payable at maturity thereof,
issue discount”
for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income taxes. If the initial offering
price to the public (excluding bond houses and brokers) at which a Series 2014A Refunding Bond is sold
is greater than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference constitutes “original issue

then such difference constitutes “original

23

premium” for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income taxes. De
minimis original issue discount and original issue premium is disregarded.

Under the Tax Code, original issue discount is treated as interest excluded from federal gross
income and exempt from State of California personal income taxes to the extent properly allocable to
each owner thereof subject to the limitations described in the first paragraph of this section. The original
issue discount accrues over the term to maturity of the Series 2014A Refunding Bond on the basis of a
constant
interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date (with straight-line
interpolations between compounding dates). The amount of original issue discount accruing during each
period is added to the adjusted basis of such Series 2014A Refunding Bonds to determine taxable gain
upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity) of such bond. The Tax Code
contains certain provisions relating to the accrual of original issue discount in the case of purchasers of
the Series 2014A Refunding Bonds who purchase the Series 2014A Refunding Bonds after the initial
offering of a substantial amount of such maturity. Owners of such Series 2014A Refunding Bonds should
consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Series 2014A
Refunding Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do not purchase
in the original offering, the allowance of a deduction for any loss on a sale or other disposition, and the
treatment of accrued original issue discount on such Series 2014A Refunding Bonds under federal
individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes.

Under the Tax Code, original issue premium is amortized on an annual basis over the term of the
Series 2014A Refunding Bond (said term being the shorter of the bond’s maturity date or its call date).
The amount of original issue premium amortized each year reduces the adjusted basis of the owner of the
Series 2014A Refunding Bond for purposes of determining taxable gain or loss upon disposition. The
amount of original issue premium on a Series 2014A Refunding Bond is amortized each year over the
term to maturity of the bond on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or
principal payment date (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). Amortized bond
premium is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Owners of premium Series 2014A Refunding
Bonds, including purchasers who do not purchase in the original offering, should consult their own tax
advisors with respect to State of California personal income tax and federal income tax consequences of
owning such Series 2014A Refunding Bonds.

California Tax Status.

In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Series 2014A
Refunding Bonds and the Series 2014B Refunding Bonds is exempt from California personal income
taxes.

Other Tax Considerations. Owners of the Refunding Bonds should also be aware that the
ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Refunding Bonds may have
federal or state tax consequences other than as described above. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion
regarding any federal or state tax consequences arising with respect to the Refunding Bonds other than as
expressly described above.

Possible Recognition of Taxable Gain or Loss upon Defeasance of the Series 2014B Refunding
Bonds. Defeasance of any Series 2014B Refunding Bonds may result in a reissuance thereof, in which
even a holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized from
the sale, exchange or retirement (less any accrued qualified stated interest which will be taxable as such)
and the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Series 2014B Refunding Bonds.

Form of Opinion. A copy of the proposed forms of opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the
Series 2014A Refunding Bonds and the Series 2014B Refunding Bonds are attached hereto as Appendix
C.

24

Legal Opinions

OTHER LEGAL MATTERS

The validity of the Refunding Bonds and certain other legal matters are subject to the approving
opinion of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, Bond Counsel. Bond Counsel expects to deliver
opinions at the time of issuance of the Refunding Bonds substantially in the respective forms set forth in
Appendix C hereto. Bond Counsel, as such, undertakes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness
or fairness of this Official Statement. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the Underwriters by
Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Irvine, California.

Legality for Investment in California

Under the provisions of the California Financial Code, the Refunding Bonds are legal investments
for commercial banks in California to the extent that the Refunding Bonds, in the informed opinion of the
bank, are prudent for the investment of funds of depositors, and, under provisions of the California
Government Code, the Refunding Bonds are eligible securities for deposit of public moneys in the State.

Continuing Disclosure

The District has covenanted for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the Refunding
Bonds to provide, or to cause to be provided, to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board through its
Electronic Municipal Market Access system or such other electronic system designated by the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board (the “EMMA System”) certain annual financial information and operating
data relating to the District (the “Annual Report”) by not later than nine months following the end of the
District’s fiscal year (currently ending June 30), commencing with the report for the 2013-14 fiscal year
(which is due no later than March 31, 2015) and notice of the occurrence of certain enumerated events
(“Notice Events”) in a timely manner not in excess of ten business days after the occurrence of such a
Notice Event. The specific nature of the information to be contained in the Annual Report and the notices
of  Notice  Events  is  set  forth  in  APPENDIX  D  −  “FORM  OF  CONTINUING  DISCLOSURE 
CERTIFICATE.” These covenants have been made in order to assist the Underwriters in complying with
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12(b)(5) (the “Rule”). A review of the District’s
compliance with its previously continuing disclosure undertakings was conducted in September 2014, and
it was found that, in the preceding five years, the District did not file its financial statements for fiscal
year 2009-10 in connection with its undertaking to provide continuing disclosure for its Series 2006B
Bonds, and the District did not file notices of certain rating changes of the bond insurer for its Series
2000A Refunding Bonds in connection with its undertakings to provide continuing disclosure for its
Series 2000A Bonds. Such financial statements for fiscal year 2009-10 and such notices of ratings
changes have since been filed. The District believes that it is now current in all of its required filings with
respect to its previous continuing disclosure undertakings.

No Litigation

No litigation is pending or threatened concerning or contesting the validity of the Refunding
Bonds or the District’s ability to receive ad valorem taxes and to collect other revenues, or contesting the
District’s ability to issue and retire the Refunding Bonds. The District is not aware of any litigation
pending or threatened questioning the political existence of the District or contesting the title to their
offices of District officers who will execute the Refunding Bonds or District or County officials who will
sign certifications relating to the Refunding Bonds, or the powers of those offices. A certificate (or
certificates) to that effect will be furnished to the Underwriters at the time of the original delivery of the
Refunding Bonds.

25

The District is routinely subject to lawsuits and claims. In the opinion of the District, the
aggregate amount of the uninsured liabilities of the District under these lawsuits and claims will not
materially affect the financial position or operations of the District.

ESCROW VERIFICATION

The arithmetical accuracy of certain computations included in the schedules provided by the
Underwriters relating to the computation of the projected payments of principal and interest to retire the
Refunded Bonds to be refunded will be verified by Causey Demgen & Moore P.C., Denver, Colorado
(the “Verification Agent”). Such computations will be based solely on assumptions and information
supplied by the District and the Underwriters. The Verification Agent will restrict its procedures to
verifying the arithmetical accuracy of certain computations and will not make any study to evaluate the
assumptions and information on which the computations are based, and will express no opinion on the
data used, the reasonableness of the assumptions or the achievability of the projected outcome.

Ratings

MISCELLANEOUS

Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”) has assigned its rating of “A+” to the Refunding
Bonds. Rating agencies generally base their ratings on their own investigations, studies and assumptions.
The rating reflects only the view of the rating agency furnishing the same, and any explanation of the
significance of such rating should be obtained only from the rating agency providing the same. Such
rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Refunding Bonds. There is no assurance that any
rating will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised downward or withdrawn
entirely by the rating agency providing the same, if, in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances
so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of a rating may have an adverse effect on the
market price of the Refunding Bonds. Neither the Underwriters nor the District has undertaken any
responsibility after the offering of the Refunding Bonds to assure the maintenance of the rating or to
oppose any such revision or withdrawal.

In connection with the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, the District may obtain the Policy from
BAM pursuant to a commitment that has been issued by it to the District. The Policy, if obtained, would
guarantee the scheduled payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds covered thereby, as
more fully described herein. See “POSSIBLE BOND INSURANCE.” No assurance can be given as to
(a) whether the District will decide to obtain the Policy from BAM in connection with the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds, or (b) whether the District will insure all or less than all of the Refunding Bonds. The
decision as to whether or not the Policy will be obtained from BAM with respect to all or a portion of the
Refunding Bonds will be made at or about the time of the pricing of the Refunding Bonds and will be
based upon, among other things, market conditions existing at such time. If the District does decide to
obtain the Policy from BAM, the Insured Bonds are expected to be rated “AA” by S&P. Such rating is
expected to be assigned solely as a result of the issuance of the Policy and would reflect only the rating
agency’s views of the claims-paying ability and financial strength of BAM. The Underwriters and the
District have not made any independent investigation of the claims-paying ability of BAM and no
representation is made that any insured rating of the Insured Bonds based upon the purchase of the Policy
will remain higher than the rating agency’s underlying rating of the Refunding Bonds described above,
which did not take bond insurance into account. The existence of the Policy will not, of itself, negatively
affect such underlying rating. Without regard to any bond insurance, the Refunding Bonds are payable
from the proceeds of an ad valorem tax approved by the voters of the District pursuant to all applicable
laws and constitutional requirements, and required to be levied by the County on property within the
District in an amount sufficient for the timely payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding
Bonds. See “SECURITY AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE REFUNDING BONDS.” However,

26

any downward revision or withdrawal of any rating of BAM may have an adverse effect on the market
price or marketability of the Insured Bonds.

DISTRICT FINANCIAL MATTERS

State Funding of Education; State Budget Process

General. As is true for all school districts in California, the District’s operating income consists
primarily of two components: a State portion funded from the State’s general fund and a local portion
derived from the District’s share of the 1% local ad valorem tax authorized by the State Constitution. In
addition, school districts may be eligible for other special categorical funding from State and federal
government programs. The District budgeted to receive approximately 80% of its general fund revenues
from State funds (not including the local portion derived from the District’s share of the local ad valorem
tax), budgeted at approximately $36.6 million in fiscal year 2014-15. As a result, decreases or deferrals in
State revenues, or in State legislative appropriations made to fund education, may significantly affect the
District’s revenues and operations.

Under Proposition 98, a constitutional and statutory amendment adopted by the State’s voters in
1988 and amended by Proposition 111 in 1990 (now found at Article XVI, Sections 8 and 8.5 of the
Constitution), a minimum level of funding is guaranteed to school districts, community college districts,
and other State agencies that provide direct elementary and secondary instructional programs. Recent
years have seen frequent disruptions in State personal income taxes, sales and use taxes, and corporate
taxes, making it increasingly difficult for the State to meet its Proposition 98 funding mandate, which
normally commands about 45% of all State general fund revenues, while providing for other fixed State
costs and priority programs and services. Because education funding constitutes such a large part of the
State’s general fund expenditures, it
the center of annual budget negotiations and
adjustments.

is generally at

State Budget Process. According to the State Constitution, the Governor must propose a budget
to the State Legislature no later than January 10 of each year, and a final budget must be adopted no later
than June 15. Historically, the budget required a two-thirds vote of each house of the State Legislature for
passage. However, on November 2, 2010, the State’s voters approved Proposition 25, which amended the
State Constitution to lower the vote requirement necessary for each house of the State Legislature to pass
a budget bill and send it to the Governor. Specifically, the vote requirement was lowered from two–thirds
to a simple majority (50% plus one) of each house of the State Legislature. The lower vote requirement
also would apply to trailer bills that appropriate funds and are identified by the State Legislature “as
related to the budget in the budget bill.” The budget becomes law upon the signature of the Governor,

A-2

who may veto specific items of expenditure. Under Proposition 25, a two–thirds vote of the State
Legislature is still required to override any veto by the Governor. School district budgets must generally
be adopted by July 1, and revised by the school board within 45 days after the Governor signs the budget
act to reflect any changes in budgeted revenues and expenditures made necessary by the adopted State
budget. The Governor signed the fiscal year 2014-15 State budget on June 20, 2014.

When the State budget is not adopted on time, basic appropriations and the categorical funding
portion of each school district’s State funding are affected differently. Under the rule of White v. Davis
(also referred to as Jarvis v. Connell), a State Court of Appeal decision reached in 2002, there is no
constitutional mandate for appropriations to school districts without an adopted budget or emergency
appropriation, and funds for State programs cannot be disbursed by the State Controller until that time,
unless the expenditure is (i) authorized by a continuing appropriation found in statute, (ii) mandated by
the Constitution (such as appropriations for salaries of elected State officers), or (iii) mandated by federal
law (such as payments to State workers at no more than minimum wage). The State Controller has
consistently stated that basic State funding for schools is continuously appropriated by statute, but that
special and categorical funds may not be appropriated without an adopted budget. Should the State
Legislature fail to pass a budget or emergency appropriation before the start of any fiscal year, the District
might experience delays in receiving certain expected revenues. The District is authorized to borrow
temporary funds to cover its annual cash flow deficits, and as a result of the White v. Davis decision, the
District might find it necessary to increase the size or frequency of its cash flow borrowings, or to borrow
earlier in the fiscal year. The District does not expect the White v. Davis decision to have any long-term
effect on its operating budgets.

Aggregate State Education Funding. The Proposition 98 guaranteed amount for education is
based on prior-year funding, as adjusted through various formulas and tests that take into account State
proceeds of taxes, local property tax proceeds, school enrollment, per-capita personal income, and other
factors. The State’s share of the guaranteed amount is based on State general fund tax proceeds and is not
based on the general fund in total or on the State budget. The local share of the guaranteed amount is
funded from local property taxes. The total guaranteed amount varies from year to year and throughout
the stages of any given fiscal year’s budget, from the Governor’s initial budget proposal to actual
expenditures to post-year-end revisions, as better information regarding the various factors becomes
available. Over the long run, the guaranteed amount will increase as enrollment and per capita personal
income grow.

If, at year-end, the guaranteed amount is calculated to be higher than the amount actually
appropriated in that year, the difference becomes an additional education funding obligation, referred to
as “settle-up.” If the amount appropriated is higher than the guaranteed amount in any year, that higher
funding level permanently increases the base guaranteed amount in future years. The Proposition 98
guaranteed amount is reduced in years when general fund revenue growth lags personal income growth,
and may be suspended for one year at a time by enactment of an urgency statute. In either case, in
subsequent years when State general fund revenues grow faster than personal income (or sooner, as the
Legislature may determine), the funding level must be restored to the guaranteed amount, the obligation
to do so being referred to as “maintenance factor.”

In recent years, the State’s response to fiscal difficulties has had a significant impact on
Proposition 98 funding and settle-up treatment. The State has sought to avoid or delay paying settle-up
amounts when funding has lagged the guaranteed amount. In response, teachers’ unions, the State
Superintendent and others sued the State or Governor in 1995, 2005, 2009 and 2011 to force them to fund
schools in the full amount required. The settlement of the 1995 and 2005 lawsuits has so far resulted in
over $4 billion in accrued State settle-up obligations. However, legislation enacted to pay down the
obligations through additional education funding over time, including the Quality Education Investment

A-3

Act of 2006, have also become part of annual budget negotiations, resulting in repeated adjustments and
deferrals of the settle-up amounts.

The State has also sought to preserve general fund cash while avoiding increases in the base
guaranteed amount through various mechanisms: by treating any excess appropriations as advances
against subsequent years’ Proposition 98 minimum funding levels rather than current year increases; by
temporarily deferring apportionments of Proposition 98 funds from one fiscal year to the next; by
permanently deferring apportionments of Proposition 98 funds from one fiscal year to the next; by
suspending Proposition 98, as the State did in fiscal year 2004-2005, fiscal year 2010-2011, fiscal year
2011-2012 and fiscal year 2012-13; and by proposing to amend the State Constitution’s definition of the
guaranteed amount and settle-up requirement under certain circumstances.

The District cannot predict how State income or State education funding will vary over the term
to maturity of the Refunding Bonds, and the District takes no responsibility for informing owners of the
Refunding Bonds as to actions the State Legislature or Governor may take affecting the current year’s
budget after its adoption. Information about the State budget and State spending for education is regularly
available at various State-maintained websites. Text of proposed and adopted budgets may be found at the
website of the Department of Finance, www.dof.ca.gov, under the heading “California Budget.” An
impartial analysis of the budget is posted by the Office of the Legislative Analyst at www.lao.ca.gov. In
addition, various State of California official statements, many of which contain a summary of the current
and past State budgets and the impact of those budgets on school districts in the State, may be found at
the website of the State Treasurer, www.treasurer.ca.gov. The information referred to is prepared by the
respective State agency maintaining each website and not by the District, and the District can take no
responsibility for the continued accuracy of these internet addresses or for the accuracy, completeness or
timeliness of information posted there, and such information is not

Local Control Funding Formula. The State budget for fiscal year 2013-14 contained a new
formula for funding the school finance system (the “Local Control Funding Formula” or “LCFF”). The
LCFF replaced the revenue limit funding system and most categorical programs. See “– Allocation of
State Funding to School Districts; Local Control Funding Formula” herein for more information.

2014-15 State Budget. The Governor signed the fiscal year 2014-15 State budget (the “2014-15
State Budget”) on June 20, 2014. The 2014-15 State Budget represents a multiyear plan that is balanced
and that continues to focus on paying down budgetary debt from prior years, setting aside reserves and
implementing a funding plan for the State Teachers’ Retirement System (“CalSTRS”). The 2014-15 State
Budget provides for $109.4 billion in revenues and transfers for fiscal year 2014-15 (which amount
includes a $3.9 billion prior year general fund balance from fiscal year 2013-14), $108.0 billion in
expenditures and a balance of $450 million in the general fund traditional reserve and $1.6 billion in a
rainy day fund (the “Rainy Day Fund”). Revenues and expenditures for fiscal year 2013-14, as revised
under the 2014-15 State Budget, were $104.6 billion (which amount includes a $2.4 billion prior year
general fund balance from fiscal year 2012-13) and $100.7 billion, respectively.

The 2014-15 State Budget projects that budgetary debt, which was approximately $35 billion at
the end of fiscal year 2010-11 and $26 billion at the end of fiscal year 2013-14, will be eliminated by the
end of fiscal year 2017-18. For fiscal year 2014-15, specifically, the 2014-15 State Budget dedicates to
paying down more than $10 billion of budgetary debt, including approximately $5 billion to pay down the
deferral of payments to schools.

As it relates to K-12 education, the 2014-15 State Budget provides total funding of $76.6 billion
($45.3 billion general fund and $31.3 billion other funds). The 2014-15 State Budget provides Proposition

A-4

98 funding for all K-14 education of $60.9 billion for fiscal year 2014-15. Such amount, when combined
with an aggregate increase of $4.4 billion from fiscal years 2012-13 and 2013-14 provided for in the
2014-15 State Budget, results in an increase of $10 billion in funding for K-14 education. The 2014-15
State Budget notes that Proposition 98 funding for K-12 education has grown by more than $12 billion
from fiscal year 2011-12 to fiscal year 2014-15, representing an increase of more than $1,900 per student.

Certain budget adjustments for K-12 programs include the following:

• 

Local Control Funding Formula. An increase of $4.75 billion in Proposition 98 general 
funds to continue the State’s transition to the Local Control Funding Formula. This formula commits
most new funding to districts serving English language learners, students from low-income families, and
youth in foster care. This increase will close the remaining funding implementation gap by more than
29%. Additionally,
the 2014-15 State Budget addresses an administrative problem related to the
collection of income eligibility forms that are used to determine student eligibility for free or reduced-
price meals.

•

K-12 Deferrals. The 2014-15 State Budget repays nearly $4.7 billion in Proposition 98
general funds for K-12 expenses that had been deferred from one year to the next during the economic
downturn, leaving an outstanding balance of less than $900 million in K-12 deferrals. Further, the 2014-
15 State Budget includes a trigger mechanism that will appropriate any additional funding resources
attributable to the 2013-14 and 2014-15 fiscal years subsequent to the enactment of the 2014-15 State
Budget for the purpose of retiring this remaining deferral balance.

•

Independent Study. The 2014-15 State Budget streamlines the existing independent study
program, reducing administrative burdens and freeing up time for teachers to spend on student instruction
and support, while making it easier for schools to offer and expand instructional opportunities available to
students through non-classroom based instruction.

•

K-12 Mandates. An increase of $400.5 million in one-time Proposition 98 general funds
to reimburse K-12 local educational agencies for the costs of State-mandated programs. These funds will
make a significant down payment on outstanding mandate debt, while providing school districts, county
offices of education and charter schools with discretionary resources to support critical investments such
as Common Core implementation.

•

K-12 High-Speed Internet Access. An increase of $26.7 million in one-time Proposition
98 general funds for the K-12 High Speed Network to provide technical assistance and grants to local
educational agencies to address the technology requirements necessary for successful Common Core
implementation. Based on an assessment by the K-12 High Speed Network, these funds will be targeted
to those local educational agencies most in need of help with securing required internet connectivity and
infrastructure to implement the new computer adaptive tests under Common Core.

•

Career Technical Education Pathways Program. An increase of $250 million in one-time
Proposition 98 general funds to support a second cohort of competitive grants for participating K-14 local
educational agencies. Established in the State Budget Act for fiscal year 2012-13, the Career Pathways
Trust Program provides grant awards to improve career technical programs and linkages between
employers, schools, and community colleges.

Rainy Day Fund. The 2014-15 State Budget proposes certain constitutional amendments to the
Rainy Day Fund that will be on the November 2014 ballot. If approved by the voters, the constitutional
amendments would (i) require deposits into the Rainy Day Fund whenever capital gains revenues rise to
more than 8% of general fund tax revenues (and the 2014-15 State Budget notes that capital gains

A-5

revenues are expected to account for approximately 9.8% of general fund revenues in fiscal year 2014-
15); (ii) set the maximize size of the Rainy Day Fund at 10% of general fund revenues; (iii) for the next
15 years, require half of each year’s deposit to be used for supplemental payments to pay down the
budgetary debts or other long-term liabilities and, thereafter, require at least half of each year’s deposit to
be saved and the remainder use for supplemental debt payments or savings; (iv) allow the withdrawal of
funds only for a disaster or if spending remains at or below the highest level of spending from the past
three years; (v) require the State to provide a multiyear budget forecast; and (vi) create a Proposition 98
reserve (the Public School System Stabilization Account) to set aside funds in good years to minimize
future cuts and smooth school spending. The State may deposit amounts into such account only after it
has paid all amounts owing to school districts relating to the Proposition 98 maintenance factor for fiscal
years prior to fiscal year 2014-15. The State, in addition, may not transfer funds to the Public School
System Stabilization Account unless the State is in a Test 1 year under Proposition 98 or in any year in
which a maintenance factor is created.

SB 858. As part of the 2014-15 State Budget, the Governor signed Senate Bill 858 (“SB 858”)
which includes provisions which could limit the amount of reserves that may be maintained by a school
district in certain circumstances. Such provisions, however, would only become effective upon the State
voters approval of the constitutional amendments relating to the Rainy Day Fund described above. Under
SB 858, in any fiscal year immediately following a fiscal year in which the State has made a transfer into
the Public School System Stabilization Account, any adopted or revised budget by a school district would
need to contain a combined unassigned and assigned ending fund balance that (a) for school districts with
an Average Daily Attendance (“A.D.A.”) of less than 400,000, is not more than two times the amount of
the reserve for economic uncertainties mandated by the Education Code, or (b) for school districts with an
A.D.A. that is more than 400,000, is not more than three times the amount of the reserve for economic
uncertainties mandated by the Education Code. In certain cases, the county superintendent of schools may
grant a school district a waiver from this limitation on reserves for up to two consecutive years within a
three-year period if there are certain extraordinary fiscal circumstances.

The District, which has an A.D.A. of less than 400,000, is required to maintain a reserve for
economic uncertainty in an amount equal to 3% of its general fund expenditures and other financing uses.
The District’s original adopted budget for fiscal year 2014-15 projected total expenditures and other
financing uses of approximately $46.4 million, 3% of which is approximately $1.4 million. The
estimated maximum amount permitted under SB 858 in fiscal year 2014-15, if SB 848 were in effect for
such fiscal year, would be approximately $2.8 million. The District’s original adopted budget for fiscal
year 2014-15 projected a combined assigned and unassigned ending fund balance of approximately $1.8
million, which is approximately $1.0 million less than the maximum that would be permitted under SB
858 if SB 858 were in effect.

The District cannot provide any assurances that the constitutional amendments related to the
Rainy Day Fund will be approved by the State voters. The District does not expect SB 858, if approved
and operative, to adversely affect its ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds as
and when due.

AB 1469. As part of the 2014-15 State Budget, the Governor signed Assembly Bill 1469 (“AB
1469”) which implements a new funding strategy for CalSTRS, increasing the employer contribution rate
in fiscal year 2014-15 from 8.25% to 8.88% of covered payroll. See “– Retirement Benefits – CalSTRS”
herein for more information about CalSTRS and AB 1469.

The complete 2014-15 State Budget is available from the California Department of Finance
website at www.dof.ca.gov. The District can take no responsibility for the continued accuracy of this

Prohibitions on Diverting Local Revenues for State Purposes. Beginning in 1992-93, the State
satisfied a portion of its Proposition 98 obligations by shifting part of the property tax revenues otherwise
belonging to cities, counties, special districts, and redevelopment agencies, to school and community
college districts through a local Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF) in each county. Local
agencies, objecting to invasions of their local revenues by the State, sponsored a statewide ballot initiative
intended to eliminate the practice. In response, the State Legislature proposed an amendment to the State
Constitution, which the State’s voters approved as Proposition 1A at the November 2004 election. That
measure was generally superseded by the passage of a new initiative constitutional amendment at the
November 2010 election, known as “Proposition 22.”

The effect of Proposition 22 is to prohibit the State, even during a period of severe fiscal
hardship, from delaying the distribution of tax revenues for transportation, redevelopment, or local
government projects and services. It prevents the State from redirecting redevelopment agency property
tax increment to any other local government, including school districts, or from temporarily shifting
property taxes from cities, counties and special districts to schools, as in the ERAF program. This is
intended to, among other things, stabilize local government revenue sources by restricting the State’s
control over local property taxes. One effect of this amendment will be to deprive the State of fuel tax
revenues to pay debt service on most State bonds for transportation projects, reducing the amount of State
general fund resources available for other purposes, including education.

Prior to the passage of Proposition 22, the State invoked Proposition 1A to divert $1.935 billion
in local property tax revenues in 2009-10 from cities, counties, and special districts to the State to offset
State general fund spending for education and other programs, and included another diversion in the
adopted 2009-10 State budget of $1.7 billion in local property tax revenues from local redevelopment
agencies,  which  local  redevelopment  agencies  have  now  been  dissolved  (see  “−  Dissolution  of 
Redevelopment Agencies” below). Redevelopment agencies had sued the State over this latter diversion.
However, the lawsuit was decided against the California Redevelopment Association on May 1, 2010.
Because Proposition 22 reduces the State’s authority to use or shift certain revenue sources, fees and taxes
for State general fund purposes, the State will have to take other actions to balance its budget in some
years—such as reducing State spending or increasing State taxes, and school and community college
districts that receive Proposition 98 or other funding from the State will be more directly dependent upon
the State’s general fund.

Dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies. The adopted State budget for fiscal 2011-12, as signed
by the Governor of the State on June 30, 2011, included as trailer bills Assembly Bill No. 26 (First
Extraordinary Session) (“AB1X 26”) and Assembly Bill No. 27 (First Extraordinary Session) (“AB1X
27”), which the Governor signed on June 29, 2011. AB1X 26 suspended most redevelopment agency
activities and prohibited redevelopment agencies from incurring indebtedness, making loans or grants, or
entering into contracts after June 29, 2011. AB1X 26 dissolved all redevelopment agencies in existence
and designated “successor agencies” and “oversight boards” to satisfy “enforceable obligations” of the
former redevelopment agencies and administer dissolution and wind down of the former redevelopment
agencies. Certain provisions of AB1X 26 are described further below.

In July of 2011, various parties filed an action before the Supreme Court of the State of California
(the “Court”) challenging the validity of AB1X 26 and AB1X 27 on various grounds (California
Redevelopment Association v. Matosantos). On December 29, 2011, the Court rendered its decision in
Matosantos upholding virtually all of AB1X 26 and invalidating AB1X 27. In its decision, the Court also

A-7

modified various deadlines for the implementation of AB1X 26. The deadlines for implementation of
AB1X 26 below take into account the modifications made by the Court in Matosantos.

On February 1, 2012, and pursuant to Matosantos, AB1X 26 dissolved all redevelopment
agencies in existence and designated “successor agencies” and “oversight boards” to satisfy “enforceable
obligations” of the former redevelopment agencies and administer dissolution and wind down of the
former redevelopment agencies. With limited exceptions, all assets, properties, contracts, leases, records,
buildings and equipment, including cash and cash equivalents of a former redevelopment agency will be
transferred to the control of its successor agency and, unless otherwise required pursuant to the terms of
an enforceable obligation, distributed to various related taxing agencies pursuant to AB1X 26.

AB1X 26 requires redevelopment agencies to continue to make scheduled payments on and
perform obligations required under its “enforceable obligations.” For this purpose, AB1X 26 defines
“enforceable obligations” to include “bonds, including the required debt service, reserve set-asides, and
any other payments required under the indenture or similar documents governing the issuance of
outstanding bonds of the former redevelopment agency” and “any legally binding and enforceable
agreement or contract that is not otherwise void as violating the debt limit or public policy.” AB1X 26
specifies that only payments included on an “enforceable obligation payment schedule” adopted by a
redevelopment agency shall be made by a redevelopment agency until its dissolution. However, until a
successor agency adopts a “recognized obligation payment schedule” the only payments permitted to be
made are payments on enforceable obligations included on an enforceable obligation payment schedule.
A successor agency may amend the enforceable obligation payment schedule at any public meeting,
subject to the approval of its oversight board.

Under AB1X 26, commencing February 1, 2012, property taxes that would have been allocated to
each redevelopment agency if the agencies had not been dissolved will instead be deposited in a
“redevelopment property tax trust fund” created for each former redevelopment agency by the related
county auditor-controller and held and administered by the related county auditor-controller as provided
in AB1X 26. AB1X 26 generally requires each county auditor-controller, on May 16, 2012 and June 1,
2012 and each January 16 and June 1 (now each January 2 and June 1 pursuant to AB 1484, as described
below) thereafter, to apply amounts in a related redevelopment property tax trust fund, after deduction of
the county auditor-controller’s administrative costs, in the following order of priority:

•

To pay pass-through payments to affected taxing entities in the amounts that would have
been owed had the former redevelopment agency not been dissolved; provided, however, that if a
successor agency determines that insufficient funds will be available to make payments on the recognized
obligation payment schedule and the county auditor-controller and State Controller verify such
determination, pass-through payments that had previously been subordinated to debt service may be
reduced;

•

To the former redevelopment agency’s successor agency for payments listed on the

successor agency’s recognized obligation payment schedule for the ensuing six-month period;

•
costs; and

To the former redevelopment agency’s successor agency for payment of administrative

•

Any remaining balance to school entities and local taxing agencies.

It is possible that there will be additional legislation proposed and/or enacted to “clean up”
various inconsistencies contained in AB1X 26 and there may be additional legislation proposed and/or
enacted in the future affecting the current scheme of dissolution and winding up of redevelopment

A-8

agencies currently contemplated by AB1X 26. For example, AB 1484 was signed by the Governor on
June 27, 2012, to clarify and amend certain aspects of AB1X 26. AB 1484, among other things, attempts
to clarify the role and requirements of successor agencies, provides successor agencies with more control
over agency bond proceeds and properties previously owned by redevelopment agencies and adds other
new and modified requirements and deadlines. AB 1484 also provides for a “tax claw back” provision,
wherein the State is authorized to withhold sales and use tax revenue allocations to local successor
agencies to offset payment of property taxes owed and not paid by such local successor agencies to other
local taxing agencies. This “tax claw back” provision has been challenged in court by certain cities and
successor agencies. The District cannot predict the outcome of such litigation and what effect, if any, it
will have on the District. Additionally, no assurances can be given as to the effect of any such future
proposed and/or enacted legislation on the District.

Future Budgets and Budgetary Actions. The District cannot predict what actions will be taken in
the future by the State Legislature and the Governor to address any changing State revenues and
expenditures or the impact such actions will have on State revenues available in the current or future
years for K-12 education. The State budget will be affected by national and State economic conditions
and other factors over which the District cannot predict and will have no control. Certain actions could
result in a significant shortfall of revenue and cash, and could impair the State’s ability to fund schools in
future fiscal years. Certain factors, like an economic recession, could result in State budget shortfalls in
any fiscal year and could have a material adverse financial impact on the District.

Allocation of State Funding to School Districts; Local Control Funding Formula

Prior to the implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula in fiscal year 2013-14, under
California Education Code Section 42238 and following, each school district was determined to have a
target funding level: a “base revenue limit” per student multiplied by the district’s student enrollment
measured in units of average daily attendance. The base revenue limit was calculated from the district’s
prior-year funding level, as adjusted for a number of factors, such as inflation, special or increased
instructional needs and costs, employee retirement costs, especially low enrollment, increased pupil
transportation costs, etc. Generally, the amount of State funding allocated to each school district was the
amount needed to reach that district’s base revenue limit after taking into account certain other revenues,
in particular, locally generated property taxes. This is referred to as State “equalization aid.” To the extent
local tax revenues increased due to growth in local property assessed valuation, the additional revenue
was offset by a decline in the State’s contribution; ultimately, a school district whose local property tax
revenues exceeded its base revenue limit was entitled to receive no State equalization aid, and received
only its special categorical aid, which is deemed to include the “basic aid” of $120 per student per year
guaranteed by Article IX, Section 6 of the Constitution. Such districts were known as “basic aid districts.”
School districts that received some equalization aid were commonly referred to as “revenue limit
districts.” The District was a revenue limit district.

Beginning in fiscal year 2013-14, the LCFF replaced the revenue limit funding system and most
categorical programs, and distributes combined resources to school districts through a base revenue limit
funding grant (“Base Grant”) per unit of A.D.A. with additional supplemental funding allocated to local
educational agencies based on their proportion of English language learners, students from low-income
families and foster youth. The LCFF has an eight year implementation program to incrementally close the
gap between actual funding and the target level of funding, as described below. The LCFF includes the
following components:

•

A Base Grant for each local education agency, equivalent to $7,643 per unit of A.D.A. in
fiscal year 2013-14. Such Base Grant per unit of A.D.A., adjusted by grade span variation and to be
adjusted annually for cost-of-living, is as follows: $6,845 for grades K-3, $6,947 for grades 4-6, $7,154

A-9

for grades 7-8 and $8,289 for grades 9-12. This amount includes an adjustment of 10.4% to the Base
Grant to support lowering class sizes in grades K-3, and an adjustment of 2.6% to reflect the cost of
operating career technical education programs in grades 9-12.

•

A 20% supplemental grant for the unduplicated number of English language learners,
students from low-income families and foster youth to reflect increased costs associated with educating
those students.

•

An additional concentration grant of up to 22.5% of a local education agency’s Base
Grant, based on the number of English language learners, students from low-income families and foster
youth served by the local education agency that comprise more than 55% of enrollment.

•

An Economic Recovery Target (the “ERT”) that is intended to ensure that almost every
local education agency receives at least their pre-recession funding level (i.e., the fiscal year 2007-08
revenue limit per unit of A.D.A.), adjusted for inflation, at full implementation of the LCFF. Upon full
implementation, local education agencies would receive the greater of the Base Grant or the ERT.

Of the projected $25 billion in new funding to be invested through the LCFF over the next eight
years, the vast majority of new funding will be provided for Base Grants. Specifically, of every dollar
invested through the LCFF, 84 cents will go to Base Grants, 10 cents will go to supplemental grants and 6
cents will go to concentration grants.

Under the new formula, for “basic aid districts” (as described above), local property tax revenues
would be used to offset up to the entire allocation under the new formula. However, “basic aid districts”
would continue to receive the same level of State aid as allocated in fiscal year 2012-13.

All school districts, county offices of education and charter schools are required to develop and
adopt local control and accountability plans, which will identify local goals in areas that are priorities for
the State, including pupil achievement, parent engagement and school climate. Such local control and
accountability plans are to be developed in accordance with a template to be provided by the State Board
of Education. County superintendents will review and provide support to the school districts under their
jurisdiction, while the Superintendent of Public Instruction will perform a corresponding role for county
offices of education. The 2013-14 State Budget created the California Collaborate for Education
Excellence (the “Collaborative”) to advise and assist local education agencies in achieving the goals
identified in their plans. For local education agencies that continue to struggle in meeting their goals, and
when the Collaborative indicates that additional intervention is needed, the Superintendent of Public
Instruction would have authority to make changes to a local education agency’s plan.

Attendance and Base Revenue Limit. The following table sets forth the District’s actual A.D.A.,
enrollment and base revenue limit per unit of A.D.A. for fiscal years 2010-11 through 2012-13 for grades
9-12. The A.D.A. and enrollment numbers reflected in the following table include special education.

The District projects that it will receive approximately $36.2 million in aggregate revenues
allocated under the LCFF in fiscal year 2013-14, and has budgeted to receive approximately $37.3 million
in aggregate revenues under the LCFF in fiscal year 2014-15 (or approximately 82.1% of its general fund
revenues in fiscal year 2014-15). Such amount includes supplemental grants projected to be $3.2 million
in fiscal year 2014-15. The District does not currently qualify for concentration grants.

Local Sources of Education Funding

The principal component of local revenues is a school district’s property tax revenues, i.e., each
district’s share of the local 1% property tax, received pursuant to Sections 75 and following and Sections
95 and following of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. California Education Code Section
42238(h) itemizes the local revenues that are counted towards the amount allocated under the LCFF (and
formerly, the base revenue limit) before calculating how much the State must provide in State aid. The
more local property taxes a district receives, the less State aid it is entitled to. Prior to the implementation
of the LCFF, a school district whose local property tax revenues exceeded its base revenue limit was
entitled to receive no State aid, and received only its special categorical aid which is deemed to include
the “basic aid” of $120 per student per year guaranteed by Article IX, Section 6 of the Constitution. Such
districts were known as “basic aid districts.” School districts that received some State aid were
commonly referred to as “revenue limit districts.” The District was a revenue limit district.

Under the LCFF, local property tax revenues are used to offset up to the entire State aid collection
under the new formula; however, “basic aid districts” would continue to receive the same level of State
aid as allotted in fiscal year 2012-13. See “−Allocation  of  State  Funding  to  School  Districts:    Local 
Control Funding Formula” herein for more information about the LCFF.

Local property tax revenues account for approximately 5.7% of the District’s aggregate revenues
allocated under the LCFF, and are budgeted to be $2.1 million, or 4.7% of total general fund revenues in
fiscal year 2014-15.

For a discussion of legal limitations on the ability of the District to raise revenues through local
property taxes, see “CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT
REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS” below.

Other District Revenues

Federal Revenues. The federal government provides funding for several District programs,
including special education programs.
Federal revenues, most of which are restricted, comprise
approximately 2.8% (or approximately $1.3 million) of the District’s general fund budgeted revenues for
fiscal year 2014-15.

Other State Revenues. In addition to State apportionments for Proposition 98 funding through the
Local Control Funding Formula, the District receives other State revenues which comprise approximately
2.9% (or approximately $1.3 million) of the District’s general fund budgeted revenues for fiscal year
2014-15. A significant portion of such other State revenues are amounts the District expects to receive
from State lottery funds, most of which may not be used for non-instructional purposes, such as the
acquisition of real property, the construction of facilities, or the financing of research. School districts
receive lottery funds proportional to their total A.D.A. The District’s State lottery revenue is budgeted at
$698,692 for fiscal year 2014-15.

Other Local Revenues (Parcel Tax). In addition to ad valorem property taxes, the District
receives additional local revenues from items such as a parcel tax, interest earnings and other local

A-12

sources. Other local revenues comprise approximately 12.09% (or approximately $5.5 million) of the
District’s general fund budgeted revenues for fiscal year 2014-15.

On June 5, 2012, voters in the District approved a parcel tax of $48 annually per parcel for four
years, expiring June 30, 2016 (the “Measure Y Parcel Tax”). The Measure Y Parcel Tax is budgeted to
guarantee $1,675,000 in fiscal year 2014-15. Prior to receiving voter approval for the Measure Y Parcel
Tax, the District had previously tried to receive voter approval for a parcel tax on two separate occasions
(once in 2010 and again in 2011), but such previous attempts were unsuccessful. The District cannot
provide any assurance that voters would approve of an extension of the Measure Y Parcel Tax or approval
of a new parcel tax after the Measure Y Parcel Tax expires.

In April 1985, the District leased for 99 years, until March 31, 2084, two lots (Lot 2B and Lot 4)
that comprise a former school site to a commercial real estate developer, Southwest Diversified. Under
the terms of the leases, the District annually receives a fixed amount, plus increases that take into account
the annual change in the consumer price index. In fiscal year 2012-13, the District received a total of
$62,154 in lease revenues from Southwest Diversified.

Charter Schools

Charter schools are largely independent schools operating as part of the public school system
created pursuant to Part 26.8 (beginning with Section 47600) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the California
Education Code (the “Charter School Law”). A charter school is usually created or organized by a group
of teachers, parents and community leaders, or a community-based organization, and may be approved by
an existing local public school district, a county board of education or the State Board of Education. A
charter school is generally exempt from the laws governing school districts, except where specifically
noted in the law. The Charter School Law acknowledges that among its intended purposes are to (a)
provide parents and students with expanded choices in the types of educational opportunities that are
available within the public school system, (b) hold schools accountable for meeting measurable pupil
outcomes and provide schools a way to shift from a rule-based to a performance-based system of
accountability, and (c) provide competition within the public school system to stimulate improvements in
all public schools.

There is currently one charter school operating within the territory of the District. Such charter
school is an independent charter school serving grades K-12. Enrollment at such charter school was
approximately 800 students in fiscal year 2012-13. The District can make no representation as to whether
enrollment at such charter school may increase at the expense of District enrollment in future years,
whether additional charter schools will be established within the territory of the District, or as to the
impact these or other charter school developments may have on the District’s A.D.A. or finances in future
years.

Significant Accounting Policies and Audited Financial Reports

The State Department of Education imposes by law uniform financial reporting and budgeting
requirements for K- 12 school districts. Financial transactions are accounted for in accordance with the
Department of Education’s California School Accounting Manual. This manual, according to Section
41010 of the Education Code, is to be followed by all California school districts, including the District.
Significant accounting policies followed by the District are explained in Note 1 to the District’s audited
financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, which are included as Appendix B.

Independently audited financial reports are prepared annually in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles for educational institutions. The annual audit report is generally available

A-13

about six months after the June 30 close of each fiscal year. The following tables contain data abstracted
from financial statements prepared by the District’s independent auditor, Vargas and Company, Certified
Public Accountants, San Jose, California, for fiscal years 2008-09 through 2012-13.

Vargas and Company, Certified Public Accountants, have not been requested to consent to the
use or to the inclusion of their reports in this Official Statement, and they have not audited or reviewed
this Official Statement. The District is required by law to adopt its audited financial statements after a
public meeting to be conducted no later than January 31 following the close of each fiscal year.

The following tables show the statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances

for the District’s general fund for the fiscal years 2008-09 through 2012-13.

District Budget Process and County Review

State law requires school districts to adopt a balanced budget in each fiscal year. The State
Department of Education imposes a uniform budgeting and accounting format for school districts. Under
current law, a school district governing board must adopt and file with the county superintendent of
schools a tentative budget by July 1 in each fiscal year. The District is under the jurisdiction of the County
of San Mateo Superintendent of Schools.

The county superintendent must review and approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the
budget no later than August 15. The county superintendent is required to examine the adopted budget for
compliance with the standards and criteria adopted by the State Board of Education and identify technical
corrections necessary to bring the budget into compliance with the established standards. If the budget is
disapproved, it is returned to the District with recommendations for revision. The District is then required
to revise the budget, hold a public hearing thereon, adopt the revised budget, and file it with the county
superintendent no later than September 8. Pursuant to State law, the county superintendent has available
various remedies by which to impose and enforce a budget that complies with State criteria, depending on
the circumstances, if a budget is disapproved. After approval of an adopted budget, the school district’s
administration may submit budget revisions for governing board approval.

Subsequent to approval, the county superintendent will monitor each district under its jurisdiction
throughout the fiscal year pursuant to its adopted budget to determine on an ongoing basis if the district
can meet its current or subsequent year financial obligations. If the county superintendent determines that
a district cannot meet its current or subsequent year’s obligations, the county superintendent will notify
the district’s governing board of the determination and may then do either or both of the following: (a)
assign a fiscal advisor to enable the district
those obligations, or (b) if a study and
recommendations are made and a district fails to take appropriate action to meet its financial obligations,
the county superintendent will so notify the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and then may do
any or all of the following for the remainder of the fiscal year: (i) request additional information regarding
the district’s budget and operations; (ii) develop and impose, after also consulting with the district’s
governing board, revisions to the budget that will enable the district to meet its financial obligations; and
(iii) stay or rescind any action inconsistent with such revisions. However, the county superintendent may
not abrogate any provision of a collective bargaining agreement that was entered into prior to the date
upon which the county superintendent assumed authority.

to meet

A State law adopted in 1991 (known as “A.B. 1200”) imposed additional financial reporting
requirements on school districts, and established guidelines for emergency State aid apportionments.
Under the provisions of A.B. 1200, each school district is required to file interim certifications with the
county superintendent (on December 15, for the period ended October 31, and by mid-March for the
period ended January 31) as to its ability to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the then-
current fiscal year and, based on current forecasts, for the subsequent fiscal year. The county
superintendent reviews the certification and issues either a positive, negative or qualified certification. A
positive certification is assigned to any school district that will meet its financial obligations for the
current fiscal year and subsequent two fiscal years. A negative certification is assigned to any school
district that is deemed unable to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year or the
subsequent fiscal year. A qualified certification is assigned to any school district that may not meet its
financial obligations for the current fiscal year or two subsequent fiscal years. A school district that
receives a qualified or negative certification may not issue tax and revenue anticipation notes or
certificates of participation without approval by the county superintendent. In the last five years, the
District has not received a qualified or negative certification in connection with its interim financial
reports.

(1) A portion of the Series 2006D Bonds are planned to be refunded with proceeds of the Refunding Bonds. See “THE REFUNDING BONDS –
Outstanding Bonds; Plan of Finance” in the front portion of this Official Statement.

General Obligation Bonds. In addition to the Refunding Bonds, the District has eight additional
outstanding series of bonds, each of which is secured by ad valorem taxes upon all property subject to
taxation by the District, and a series of bond anticipation notes.

In March 30, 2000, the District issued its 2000 General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series A in
the aggregate principal amount of $22,060,000 (the “Series 2000A Refunding Bonds”). The proceeds of
the Series 2000A Refunding Bonds were used to advance refund the District’s General Obligation Bonds,
Election 1995, Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D.

On August 16, 2005 the Golden West Schools Financing Authority (“GWSFA”) issued its 2005
General Obligation Revenue Bonds (Jefferson Union High School District Refunding) in the amount of
$5,660,000 (the “GWSFA Bonds”) to provide funds to advance refund the District’s General Obligation
Bonds, Election of 1995, Series E (the “Series 1995E Bonds”). Concurrently, the District issued its
$5,045,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2005 General Obligation Refunding Bonds (the “Series
2005 Refunding Bonds”) as replacement bonds, which are privately held bonds. The revenue from the
Series 2005 Refunding Bonds is pledged to pay the principal of and interest on the GWSFA Bonds. The
final maturity of both series of bonds is August 1, 2030.

On November 7, 2006, over 55% of the registered voters of the District received authorization to
issue bonds of the District in an aggregate principal amount of $136,900,000 (the “2006 Authorization”).
On May 9, 2007, the District issued its General Obligation Bonds, 2006 Election, Series A (the “Series
2006A Bonds”) in the aggregate principal amount of $50,000,000, which was the District’s first series of
bonds to be issued under the 2006 Authorization. On July, 23, 2009, the District issued its General
Obligation Bonds, Series 2006 Election, Series B (the “Series 2006B Bonds”) in the aggregate initial
principal amount of $17,998,936.60, which was the District’s second series of bonds to be issued under
the 2006 Authorization. On April 29, 2010, the District issued its General Obligation Bonds, 2006

A-19

Election, Series C (the “Series 2006C Bonds”) in the aggregate principal amount of $12,000,000, which
was the District’s third series of bonds to be issued under the 2006 Authorization. On February 1, 2011,
the District issued its General Obligation Bonds, 2006 Election, Series D (the “Series 2006D Bonds”) in
the aggregate initial principal amount of $14,999,736.85, and was the District’s fourth series of bonds to
be issued under the 2006 Authorization. On June 16, 2011, in anticipation of issuing additional bonds
under the 2006 Authorization, the District issued its 2011 Taxable Bond Anticipation Notes (Direct-Pay
Qualified School Construction Bonds) (the “Series 2011 BANs”) in the aggregate principal amount of
$4,860,000. The Series 2011 BANs mature on June 1, 2016.

the District

On November 6, 2012, over 55% of the registered voters of the District received reauthorization
to issue bonds of
in an aggregate principal amount of $41,900,000 (the “2012
Reauthorization”). On May 9, 2013, the District issued $35,540,000 aggregate principal amount of its
General Obligation Bonds, 2012 Election, Series A (GO Reauthorization Bonds) (the “Series 2012A
Bonds”) as its first series of bonds issued under the 2012 Reauthorization. On June 27, 2013, the District
issued its 2012 General Obligation Ed-Tech Bonds, Series B (the “Series 2012B Bonds”), in the
aggregate principal amount of $1,500,000 for the purpose of financing technology projects.

At the November 2014 election, the registered voters of the District will be voting on a
proposition to authorize the District to issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount of $133,000,000.
The District cannot make any representations as to whether the District’s bond proposition will be
approved by the voters at the November 2014 election.

See “THE REFUNDING BONDS – Outstanding Bonds; Plan of Finance” in the front portion of
this Official Statement for more information on the bonds to be refunded with proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, and see “THE REFUNDING BONDS – Aggregate Debt Service” in the front portion of this
Official Statement for the annual debt service requirements for the District’s outstanding bonds.

Other Post-Employment Benefits. In addition to the retirement plan benefits with CalSTRS and
the State Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) (see “– Retirement Benefits” below), the
District provides certain post-retirement healthcare benefits, in accordance with District employment
contracts. The District’s health care plan (the “Plan”) provides health benefits to all qualified employees
who retire from the District on or after attaining age 55 (age 50 for school teachers with 30 of more years
of service) with at least 10 years of service. Currently, 108 employees meet those eligibility requirements.
Retirees receive benefits for lesser of seven years or age 70 if not Medicare eligible, or the lesser of 10
years or age 75 if Medicare eligible. Expenditures for post-employment benefits are recognized on a pay-
as-you-go basis, as premiums are paid.

The Governmental Accounting Standards Board released its Statement Number 45 (“Statement
Number 45”), which requires municipalities to account for other post-employment benefits (meaning
other than pension benefits) (“OPEB”) liabilities much like municipalities are required to account for
pension benefits. The expense is generally accrued over the working career of employees, rather than on a
pay-as-you-go basis, which has been the practice for most municipalities and public sector organizations.
OPEBs generally include post-employment health benefits (medical, dental, vision, prescription drug and
mental health), life insurance, disability benefits and long term care benefits. Statement Number 45 was
phased in over a three-year period based upon the entity’s revenues. Statement Number 45 became
effective for the District beginning in fiscal year 2008-09.

The contribution requirement of plan members and the District are established under a funding
policy approved by the District’s Board of Trustees, and may be amended by the District from time to
time. The District’s funding policy is to contribute an amount sufficient to pay the current year’s retiree
claim costs and plan expenses. The District has not established an irrevocable trust to prefund its OPEB

A-20

liability and no prefunding of benefits has been made. For fiscal years 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13,
the District contributed $2,232,499, $2,050,479 and $1,942,156, respectively to the Plan, including
current claim costs and Plan expenses.

Total Compensation Systems, Inc., Westlake Village, California, has prepared an actuarial
valuation covering the District’s retiree health benefits and reports that, as of November 1, 2012, the
District had an actuarial accrued liability of $19,919,856, a residual actuarial accrued liability of negative
$158,443 and an unfunded actuarial accrued liability of $20,078,299, based on certain assumptions set
forth in the actuarial valuation report (including 5.0% investment returns, 3.0% increase per year for
inflation, and 3.0% increase per year for payroll increases). For more information regarding the actuarial
valuation, the District’s annual required contribution for fiscal year 2012-13 ($2,163,865) and the
District’s net OPEB obligation at June 30, 2013 ($2,604,058), as well as other basic assumptions upon
which the valuation was based, see Note 11 to the District’s financial statements attached hereto as
APPENDIX  B  −  “FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  OF  THE  DISTRICT  FOR  THE  FISCAL  YEAR 
ENDED JUNE 30, 2013.”

Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes. Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes (“TRANS”) are
payable from revenues and cash receipts to be generated by the District. TRANs are issued by the
District to supplement the District’s cash flow when necessary. On July 3, 2014, the District issued
$4,925,000 aggregate principal amount of TRANs through the California School Cash Reserve Program
Authority, which TRANs mature on June 30, 2015. The District may issue TRANs or borrow funds in
future fiscal years as and if necessary to supplement cash flow.

Employment

As of June 30, 2014, the District employed 631 employees, consisting of 367 certificated
employees and 264 classified employees. For the year ended June 30, 2014, the total certificated and
classified payrolls were approximately $19.86 million (unaudited) and $7.84 million (unaudited),
respectively. For fiscal year 2014-15, the total certificated and classified payrolls are budgeted to be
approximately $19.72 million and $7.21 million, respectively.

The District participates in retirement plans with CalSTRS, which covers all full-time certificated
District employees, and the State Public Employees’ Retirement System, which covers certain classified
employees. Classified school personnel who are employed four or more hours per day may participate in
CalPERS.

CalSTRS. Contributions to CalSTRS are fixed in statute. In fiscal year 2013-14, teachers
contributed 8% of salary to CalSTRS, while school districts contributed 8.25%. In addition to the teacher
and school contributions, the State contributed 4.517% of teacher payroll to CalSTRS (calculated on

A-21

payroll data from two fiscal years ago). Unlike typical defined benefit programs, however, neither the
CalSTRS employer nor the State contribution rate varies annually to make up funding shortfalls or assess
credits for actuarial surpluses. The State does pay a surcharge when the teacher and school district
contributions are not sufficient to fully fund the basic defined benefit pension (generally consisting of 2%
of salary for each year of service at age 60 referred to herein as “pre-enhancement benefits”) within a 30-
year period. However, this surcharge does not apply to systemwide unfunded liability resulting from
recent benefit enhancements.

As of June 30, 2013, an actuarial valuation (the “2013 CalSTRS Actuarial Valuation”) for the
entire CalSTRS defined benefit program showed an estimated unfunded actuarial liability of $74.4
billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from the June 30, 2012 valuation. The funded ratios of the actuarial
value of valuation assets over the actuarial accrued liabilities as of June 30, 2013, June 30, 2012 and June
30, 2011, based on the actuarial assumptions, were approximately 67%, 67% and 69%, respectively.
Future estimates of the actuarial unfunded liability may change due to market performance, legislative
actions and other experience that may differ from the actuarial assumptions. The following are certain of
the actuarial assumptions set forth in the 2013 CalSTRS Actuarial Valuation: measurement of accruing
costs by the “Entry Age Normal Actuarial Cost Method,” 7.50% investment rate of return, 4.50% interest
on member accounts, 3.75% projected wage growth, and 3.00% projected inflation. The 2013 CalSTRS
Actuarial Valuation also assumes that all members hired on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the
provisions of PEPRA (as defined herein). See “−Governor’s Pension Reform” below for a discussion of 
the pension reform measure signed by the Governor in August 2012 expected to help reduce future
pension obligations of public employers with respect to employees hired on or after January 1, 2013.
Future estimates of the actuarial unfunded liability may change due to market performance, legislative
actions, changes in actuarial assumptions and other experiences that may differ from the actuarial
assumptions.

As indicated above, there was no required contribution from teachers, schools districts or the
State to fund the unfunded actuarial liability for the CalSTRS defined benefit program and only the State
legislature can change contribution rates. The 2013 CalSTRS Actuarial Valuation noted that, as of June
30, 2013, the contribution rate, inclusive of contributions from the teachers, the school districts and the
State, was equivalent to 19.497% over the next 30 years. The 2013 CalSTRS Actuarial Valuation
provides that the contribution rate would need to have been raised by 13.382% to a total of 32.879% to
amortize the unfunded liability over a 30-year period as of June 30, 2013.

As part of the 2014-15 State Budget, the Governor signed Assembly Bill 1469 which implements
a new funding strategy for CalSTRS, increasing the employer contribution rate in fiscal year 2014-15
from 8.25% to 8.88% of covered payroll. Such rate would increase by 1.85% beginning in fiscal year
2015-16 until the employer contribution rate is 19.10% of covered payroll as further described below.
Teacher contributions will also increase from 8.00% to a total of 10.25% of pay, phased in over the next
three years. The State’s total contribution will also increase from approximately 3% in fiscal year 2013-14
to 6.30% of payroll in fiscal year 2016-17, plus the continued payment of 2.5% of payroll annual for a
supplemental inflation protection program for a total of 8.80%. In addition, AB 1469 provides the State
Teachers Retirement Board with authority to modify the percentages paid by employers and employees
for fiscal year 2021-22 and each fiscal year thereafter to eliminate the CalSTRS unfunded liability by
June 30, 2046. The State Teachers Retirement Board would also have authority to reduce employer and
State contributions if they are no longer necessary.

Pursuant to Assembly Bill 1469, school district’s contribution rates will increase over a seven

year phase in period in accordance with the following schedule:

The District’s total employer contributions from all funds to CalSTRS for fiscal years 2010-11,
2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 were $1,484,503, $1,451,396, $1,501,922 and $1,588,863 (unaudited),
respectively, and were equal to 100% of the required contributions for each year. The District budgeted
total employer contributions to CalSTRS of $1,564,274 for fiscal year 2014-15. With the implementation
of AB 1469, the District anticipates that its contributions to CalSTRS will increase in future fiscal years
as compared to prior fiscal years. The District, nonetheless, is unable to predict all factors or any changes
in law that could affect its required contributions to CalSTRS in future fiscal years.

CalSTRS produces a comprehensive annual financial report and actuarial valuations which
include financial statements and required supplementary information. Copies of
the CalSTRS
comprehensive annual financial report and actuarial valuations may be obtained from CalSTRS. The
information presented in these reports is not incorporated by reference in this Official Statement.

CalPERS. All qualifying classified employees of K-12 school districts in the State are members
in CalPERS, and all of such districts participate in the same plan. As such, all such districts share the
same contribution rate in each year. However, unlike school districts’ participating in CalSTRS, the
school districts’ contributions to CalPERS fluctuate each year and include a normal cost component and a
component equal to an amortized amount of the unfunded liability. Accordingly, the District cannot
provide any assurances that the District’s required contributions to CalPERS will not significantly
increase in the future above current levels.

According to the CalPERS State and Schools Actuarial Valuation as of June 30, 2012, the
CalPERS Schools plan had a funded ratio of 75.5% on a market value of assets basis. The funded ratio as
of June 30, 2011, June 30, 2010, June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 was 78.7%, 69.5%, 65.0% and 93.8%,
respectively. According to the actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2012, the latest decline in the funded ratio
was because the investment return experienced by CalPERS in fiscal year 2011-12 was less than the
assumed 7.5%. In June 2009, the CalPERS Board of Administration adopted a new employer rate
smoothing methodology for local governments and school employer rates. It was designed to ease the
impact of the investment losses which were then expected in fiscal year 2008-09 on affiliated public
employers while strengthening the long-term financial health of
the pension fund. Under such
methodology, certain investment losses are amortized and paid off over a fixed and declining 30-year
period instead of a rolling 30-year amortization period.

In March of 2012, the CalPERS Board of Administration adopted new economic actuarial
assumptions to be used with the June 30, 2011 actuarial valuation; in particular, lowering the price
inflation assumption from 3.00% to 2.75%. Lowering the price inflation assumption resulted in a reduced
discount rate, which is the fund’s assumed rate of return calculated based on expected price inflation and
the expected real rate of return, from 7.75% to 7.5%. According to CalPERS, this reduction in the
discount rate is anticipated to increase State and school district employer contributions for each fiscal year
beginning in fiscal year 2012-13 by 1.2% to 1.6% for miscellaneous plans (which includes general office

A-23

and others) and by 2.2% to 2.4% for safety plans beginning in fiscal year 2012-13. In April of 2013, the
CalPERS Board of Administration approved changes to the CalPERS amortization and smoothing policy
intended to reduce volatility in employer contribution rates. Beginning with the June 30, 2013 actuarial
valuation, CalPERS will employ a new amortization and smoothing policy that will pay for all gains and
losses over a fixed 30-year period with the increases or decreases in the rate spread directly over a 5-year
period (as compared to the current policy of spreading investment returns over a 15-year period with
experience gains and losses paid for over a rolling 30-year period). Such changes, the implementation of
which are delayed until fiscal year 2015-16 for the State, schools and all public agencies, are expected to
increase contribution rates in the near term but lower contribution rates in the long term.

In February of 2014, the CalPERS Board of Administration adopted new actuarial demographic
assumptions that take into account public employees living longer. Such assumptions are expected to
increase costs for the State and public agency employers (including school districts), which costs will be
amortized over 20 years and phased in over three years beginning in fiscal year 2014-15 for the State and
amortized over 20 years and phased in over five years beginning in fiscal year 2016-17 for the employers.
CalPERS estimates that the new demographic assumptions could cost public agency employers up to 9%
of payroll for safety employees and up to 5% of payroll for miscellaneous employees at the end of the
five year phase in period. To the extent, however, that future experiences differ from CalPERS’ current
assumptions, the required employer contributions may vary.

The District’s total employer contributions from all funds to CalPERS for fiscal years 2010-11,
2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 were $759,193, $765,989, $827,748 and $833,659 (unaudited),
respectively, and were equal to 100% of the required contributions for each year. The District budgeted
total employer contributions to CalPERS of $754,965 for fiscal year 2014-15. With the change in
actuarial assumptions described above, the District anticipates that its contributions to CalPERS will
increase in future fiscal years as the increased costs are phased in. The implementation of PEPRA (see
“−Governor’s Pension Reform” below), however, is expected to help reduce certain future pension
obligations of public employers with respect to employees hired on or after January 1, 2013. The District
cannot predict the impact these changes will have on its contributions to CalPERS in future years.

CalPERS produces a comprehensive annual financial report and actuarial valuations that include
financial statements and required supplementary information. Copies of the CalPERS comprehensive
annual financial report and actuarial valuations may be obtained from CalPERS Financial Services
Division. The information presented in these reports is not incorporated by reference in this Official
Statement

Governor’s Pension Reform. On August 28, 2012, Governor Brown and the State Legislature
reached agreement on a new law that reforms pensions for State and local government employees. AB
340, which was signed into law on September 12, 2012, established the California Public Employees’
Pension Reform Act of 2012 (“PEPRA”) which governs pensions for public employers and public
pension plans on and after January 1, 2013. For new employees, PEPRA, among other things, caps
pensionable salaries at the Social Security contribution and wage base, which is $110,100 for 2012, or
120% of that amount for employees not covered by Social Security, increases the retirement age by two
years or more for all new public employees while adjusting the retirement formulas, requires state
employees to pay at least half of their pension costs, and also requires the calculation of benefits on
regular, recurring pay to stop income spiking. For all employees, changes required by PEPRA include the
prohibition of retroactive pension increases, pension holidays and purchases of service credit. PEPRA
applies to all State and local public retirement systems, including county and district retirement systems.
PEPRA only exempts the University of California system and charter cities and counties whose pension
plans are not governed by State law. Although the District anticipates that PEPRA would not increase the
District’s future pension obligations, the District is unable to determine the extent of any impact PEPRA

A-24

would have on the District’s pension obligations at this time. Additionally, the District cannot predict if
PEPRA will be challenged in court and, if so, whether any challenge would be successful.

The District is unable to predict what the amount of State pension liabilities will be in the future,
or the amount of the contributions which the District may be required to make. CalSTRS and CalPERS
are more fully described in Note 10 to the District’s financial statements attached hereto as APPENDIX B
−  “FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  OF  THE  DISTRICT  FOR  THE  FISCAL  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30, 
2013.”

GASB 67 and 68. In June 2012, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board approved a pair
of related statements, Statement Number 67, Financial Reporting for Pension Plans (“Statement Number
67”), which addresses financial reporting for pension plans, and Statement Number 68, Accounting and
Financial Reporting for Pensions (“Statement Number 68”), which establishes new accounting and
financial reporting requirements for governments that provide their employees with pensions. The
guidance contained in these statements will change how governments calculate and report the costs and
obligations associated with pensions. Statement Number 67 replaces the current requirements of
Statement Number 25, Financial Reporting for Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Note Disclosures for
Defined Contribution Plans, for most public employee pension plans, and Statement Number 27 replaces
the current requirements of Statement Number 27, Accounting for Pensions by State and Local
Governmental Employers, for most government employers. The new statements also replace the
requirements of Statement Number 50, Pension Disclosures, for those governments and pension plans.
Certain of the major changes include: (i) the inclusion of unfunded pension liabilities on the government’s
balance sheet (such unfunded liabilities are currently typically included as notes to the government’s
financial statements); (ii) full pension costs would be shown as expenses regardless of actual contribution
levels; (iii) lower actuarial discount rates would be required to be used for most plans for certain purposes
of the financial statements, resulting in increased liabilities and pension expenses; and (iv) shorter
amortization periods for unfunded liabilities would be required to be used for certain purposes of the
financial statements, which generally would increase pension expenses. Statement Number 67 will take
effect in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2013, and Statement Number 68 will take effect in fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2014.

Risk Pooling, Joint Powers Agreements and Joint Ventures

The District participates in a joint powers agreement (JPA) with San Mateo County Schools
Insurance Group, which arranges for and provides property, workers compensation, medical and liability
insurance for its member school districts. The JPA is governed by a board consisting of a representative
from each member district. The board controls the operations of its JPA, including selection of
management and approval of operating budgets independent of any influence by the member districts
beyond their representation on the board. Each member pays a premium commensurate with the level of
coverage requested and shares surpluses and deficits proportionately to their participation in each JPA.
The relationship between the District and the JPA is such that the JPA is not a component unit of the
District for financial reporting purposes.

CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS

AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS

Limitations on Revenues

On June 6, 1978, California voters approved Proposition 13 (“Proposition 13”), which added
Article XIIIA to the State Constitution (“Article XIIIA”). Article XIIIA limits the amount of any ad
valorem tax on real property to 1% of the full cash value thereof, except that additional ad valorem taxes
may be levied to pay debt service on (i) indebtedness approved by the voters prior to July 1, 1978,
(ii) bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property which has been approved on
or after July 1, 1978 by two-thirds of the voters on such indebtedness, and (iii) bonded indebtedness
incurred by a school district or community college district for the construction, reconstruction,
rehabilitation or replacement of school facilities or the acquisition or lease of real property for school
facilities, approved by 55% of the voters of the district, but only if certain accountability measures are
included in the proposition. Article XIIIA defines full cash value to mean “the county assessor’s valuation
of real property as shown on the 1975-76 tax bill under full cash value, or thereafter, the appraised value
of real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership have occurred after the
1975 assessment.” This full cash value may be increased at a rate not to exceed 2% per year to account
for inflation.

Article XIIIA has subsequently been amended to permit reduction of the “full cash value” base in
the event of declining property values caused by damage, destruction or other factors, to provide that
there would be no increase in the “full cash value” base in the event of reconstruction of property
damaged or destroyed in a disaster and in other minor or technical ways.

County of Orange v. Orange County Assessment Appeals Board No. 3. Section 51 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code permits county assessors who have reduced the assessed valuation of a
property as a result of natural disasters, economic downturns or other factors, to subsequently “recapture”
such value (up to the pre-decline value of the property) at an annual rate higher than 2%, depending on
the assessor’s measure of the restoration of value of the damaged property. The constitutionality of this
procedure was challenged in a lawsuit brought in 2001 in the Orange County Superior Court, and in
similar lawsuits brought in other counties, on the basis that the decrease in assessed value creates a new
“base year value” for purposes of Proposition 13 and that subsequent increases in the assessed value of a
property by more than 2% in a single year violate Article XIIIA. On appeal, the California Court of
Appeal upheld the recapture practice in 2004, and the State Supreme Court declined to review the ruling,
leaving the recapture law in place.

Legislation Implementing Article XIIIA. Legislation has been enacted and amended a number of
times since 1978 to implement Article XIIIA. Under current law, local agencies are no longer permitted to
levy directly any property tax (except to pay voter-approved indebtedness). The 1% property tax is
automatically levied by the county and distributed according to a formula among taxing agencies. The
formula apportions the tax roughly in proportion to the relative shares of taxes levied prior to 1989.

Increases of assessed valuation resulting from reappraisals of property due to new construction,
change in ownership or from the 2% annual adjustment are allocated among the various jurisdictions in
the “taxing area” based upon their respective “situs.” Any such allocation made to a local agency
continues as part of its allocation in future years.

Beginning in the 1981-82 fiscal year, assessors in the State no longer record property values on
tax rolls at the assessed value of 25% of market value which was expressed as $4 per $100 assessed value.
All taxable property is now shown at full market value on the tax rolls. Consequently, the tax rate is

A-26

expressed as $1 per $100 of taxable value. All taxable property value included in this Official Statement
is shown at 100% of market value (unless noted differently) and all tax rates reflect the $1 per $100 of
taxable value.

Article XIIIB of the California Constitution

An initiative to amend the State Constitution entitled “Limitation of Government Appropriations”
was approved on September 6, 1979, thereby adding Article XIIIB to the State Constitution (“Article
XIIIB”). Under Article XIIIB state and local governmental entities have an annual “appropriations limit”
and are not permitted to spend certain moneys which are called “appropriations subject to limitation”
(consisting of tax revenues, state subventions and certain other funds) in an amount higher than the
“appropriations limit.” Article XIIIB does not affect the appropriation of moneys which are excluded
from the definition of “appropriations subject to limitation,” including debt service on indebtedness
existing or authorized as of January 1, 1979, or bonded indebtedness subsequently approved by the
voters. In general terms, the “appropriations limit” is to be based on certain 1978-79 expenditures, and is
to be adjusted annually to reflect changes in consumer prices, populations, and services provided by these
entities. Among other provisions of Article XIIIB, if these entities’ revenues in any year exceed the
amounts permitted to be spent, the excess would have to be returned by revising tax rates or fee schedules
over the subsequent two years.

The District’s budgeted appropriations from “proceeds of taxes” (sometimes referred to as the
“Gann limit”) for the 2012-13 fiscal year are equal to the allowable limit of $34,147,056 and estimates an
appropriations limit for the 2013-14 fiscal year of $35,504,125. Any proceeds of taxes received by the
District in excess of the allowable limit are absorbed into the State’s allowable limit.

Article XIIIC and Article XIIID of the California Constitution

On November 5, 1996, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 218, popularly
known as the “Right to Vote on Taxes Act.” Proposition 218 added to the California Constitution Articles
XIIIC and XIIID (“Article XIIIC” and “Article XIIID,” respectively), which contain a number of
provisions affecting the ability of local agencies, including school districts, to levy and collect both
existing and future taxes, assessments, fees and charges.

According to the “Title and Summary” of Proposition 218 prepared by the California Attorney
General, Proposition 218 limits “the authority of local governments to impose taxes and property-related
assessments, fees and charges.” Among other things, Article XIIIC establishes that every tax is either a
“general tax” (imposed for general governmental purposes) or a “special tax” (imposed for specific
purposes), prohibits special purpose government agencies such as school districts from levying general
taxes, and prohibits any local agency from imposing, extending or increasing any special tax beyond its
maximum authorized rate without a two-thirds vote; and also provides that the initiative power will not be
limited in matters of reducing or repealing local taxes, assessments, fees and charges. Article XIIIC
further provides that no tax may be assessed on property other than ad valorem property taxes imposed in
accordance with Articles XIII and XIIIA of the California Constitution and special taxes approved by a
two-thirds vote under Article XIIIA, Section 4. Article XIIID deals with assessments and property-related
fees and charges, and explicitly provides that nothing in Article XIIIC or XIIID will be construed to affect
existing laws relating to the imposition of fees or charges as a condition of property development.

The District does not impose any taxes, assessments, or property-related fees or charges which
are subject to the provisions of Proposition 218. It does, however, receive a portion of the basic 1% ad
valorem property tax levied and collected by the County pursuant to Article XIIIA of the California
Constitution. The provisions of Proposition 218 may have an indirect effect on the District, such as by

A-27

limiting or reducing the revenues otherwise available to other local governments whose boundaries
encompass property located within the District thereby causing such local governments to reduce service
levels and possibly adversely affecting the value of property within the District.

Statutory Limitations

On November 4, 1986, State voters approved Proposition 62, an initiative statute limiting the
imposition of new or higher taxes by local agencies. The statute (a) requires new or higher general taxes
to be approved by two-thirds of the local agency’s governing body and a majority of its voters;
(b) requires the inclusion of specific information in all local ordinances or resolutions proposing new or
higher general or special taxes; (c) penalizes local agencies that fail to comply with the foregoing; and
(d) required local agencies to stop collecting any new or higher general tax adopted after July 31, 1985,
unless a majority of the voters approved the tax by November 1, 1988.

Appellate court decisions following the approval of Proposition 62 determined that certain
provisions of Proposition 62 were unconstitutional. However, the California Supreme Court upheld
Proposition 62 in its decision on September 28, 1995 in Santa Clara County Transportation Authority v.
Guardino. This decision reaffirmed the constitutionality of Proposition 62. Certain matters regarding
Proposition 62 were not addressed in the Supreme Court’s decision, such as whether the decision applies
retroactively, what remedies exist for taxpayers subject to a tax not in compliance with Proposition 62,
and whether the decision applies to charter cities.

Proposition 98 and Proposition 111

On November 8, 1988, voters approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative constitutional
amendment and statute called the “Classroom Instructional Improvement and Accountability Act” (the
“Accountability Act”). The Accountability Act changed State funding of public education below the
university level, and the operation of the State’s Appropriations Limit. The Accountability Act guarantees
State funding for K-12 school districts and community college districts (collectively, “K-14 districts”) at a
level equal to the greater of (a) the same percentage of general fund revenues as the percentage
appropriated to such districts in 1986-87, which percentage is equal to 40.9%, or (b) the amount actually
appropriated to such districts from the general fund in the previous fiscal year, adjusted for growth in
enrollment and inflation.

Since the Accountability Act is unclear in some details, there can be no assurance that the
Legislature or a court might not interpret the Accountability Act to require a different percentage of
general fund revenues to be allocated to K-14 districts than the 40.9%, or to apply the relevant percentage
to the State’s budgets in a different way than is proposed in the Governor’s Budget. In any event, the
Governor and other fiscal observers expect the Accountability Act to place increasing pressure on the
State’s budget over future years, potentially reducing resources available for other State programs,
especially to the extent the Article XIIIB spending limit would restrain the State’s ability to fund such
other programs by raising taxes.

The Accountability Act also changes how tax revenues in excess of the State Appropriations
Limit are distributed. Any excess State tax revenues up to a specified amount would, instead of being
returned to taxpayers, be transferred to K-14 districts. Such transfer would be excluded from the
Appropriations Limit for K-14 districts and the K-14 school Appropriations Limits for the next year
would automatically be increased by the amount of such transfer. These additional moneys would enter
the base funding calculation for K-14 districts for subsequent years, creating further pressure on other
portions of the State budget, particularly if revenues decline in a year following an Article XIIIB surplus.

A-28

The maximum amount of excess tax revenues which could be transferred to schools is 4% of the
minimum State spending for education mandated by the Accountability Act, as described above.

On June 5, 1990, California voters approved Proposition 111 (Senate Constitutional Amendment
1), which further modified the Constitution to alter the spending limit and education funding provisions of
Proposition 98. Most significantly, Proposition 111 (1) liberalized the annual adjustments to the spending
limit by measuring the “change in the cost of living” by the change in State per capita personal income
rather than the Consumer Price Index, and specified that a portion of the State’s spending limit would be
adjusted to reflect changes in school attendance; (2) provided that 50% of the “excess” tax revenues,
determined based on a two-year cycle, would be transferred to K-14 school districts with the balance
returned to taxpayers (rather than the previous 100% but only up to a cap of 4% of the districts’ minimum
funding level), and that any such transfer to K-14 school districts would not be built into the school
districts’ base expenditures for calculating their entitlement for State aid in the following year and would
not increase the State’s appropriations limit; (3) excluded from the calculation of appropriations that are
subject to the limit appropriations for certain “qualified capital outlay projects” and certain increases in
gasoline taxes, sales and use taxes, and receipts from vehicle weight fees; (4) provided that
the
Appropriations Limit for each unit of government, including the State, would be recalculated beginning in
the 1990-91 fiscal year, based on the actual limit for fiscal year 1986-87, adjusted forward to 1990-91 as
if Senate Constitutional Amendment 1 had been in effect; and (5) adjusted the Proposition 98 formula that
guarantees K-14 school districts a certain amount of general fund revenues, as described below.

Under prior law, K-14 school districts were guaranteed the greater of (a) 40.9% of general fund
revenues (the “first test”) or (b) the amount appropriated in the prior year adjusted for changes in the cost
of living (measured as in Article XIIIB by reference to per capita personal income) and enrollment (the
“second test”). Under Proposition 111, school districts would receive the greater of (a) the first test,
(b) the second test or (c) a third test, which would replace the second test in any year when growth in per
capita general fund revenues from the prior year was less than the annual growth in State per capita
personal income. Under the third test, school districts would receive the amount appropriated in the prior
year adjusted for change in enrollment and per capita general fund revenues, plus an additional small
adjustment factor. If the third test were used in any year, the difference between the third test and the
second test would become a “credit” to be paid in future years when general fund revenue growth exceeds
personal income growth.

Applications of Constitutional and Statutory Provisions

The application of Proposition 98 and other statutory regulations has become increasingly
difficult to predict accurately in recent years. For a discussion of how the provisions of Proposition 98
have been applied to school funding see “DISTRICT FINANCIAL MATTERS – State Funding of
Education; State Budget Process.”

Future Initiatives

Article XIIIA, Article XIIIB, Article XIIIC, Article XIIID, as well as Propositions 62, 98, 111
and 218, were each adopted as measures that qualified for the ballot pursuant to the State’s initiative
process. From time to time other initiative measures could be adopted, further affecting District revenues
or the District’s ability to expend revenues.

Members of the Governing Board:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Jefferson Union High School District (the
“District”) in connection with the issuance by the District of its Jefferson Union High
School District (County of San Mateo, California) General Obligation Refunding Bonds,
Series 2014A (Tax Exempt) in the aggregate principal amount of $________ (the
“Bonds”), under Articles 9 and 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the
California Government Code, commencing with Section 53550 of said Code (the “Bond
Law”) and under a resolution of the Governing Board of the District adopted on August
5, 2014 (the “Bond Resolution”). We have examined the law and such certified
proceedings and other papers as we have deemed necessary to render this opinion.

As to questions of

representations of the Board contained in the Bond Resolution and in the certified
proceedings and certifications of public officials and others furnished to us without
undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation.

Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:

1.

The District is duly established and validly existing as a school district with
the power to issue the Bonds and to perform its obligations under the Bond Resolution.

C-1

2.

The Bond Resolution has been duly adopted by the Governing Board of
the District and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the District enforceable
against the District in accordance with its terms.

3.

The Bonds have been duly issued and sold by the District and are valid
and binding general obligations of the District, and the County of San Mateo is obligated
to levy ad valorem taxes for the payment of the Bonds and the interest thereon upon all
property within the District subject to taxation by the District, without limitation as to rate
or amount.

4.

Interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income
tax purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative
minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations; it should be noted, however, that
for the purpose of computing the alternative minimum tax imposed on such corporations
(as defined for federal income tax purposes), such interest is required to be taken into
account in determining certain income and earnings. The opinions set forth in the
preceding sentence are subject
the District comply with all
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that must be satisfied
subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest thereon be, or continue to
be, excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes. The District has
covenanted to comply with each such requirement. Failure to comply with certain of
such requirements may cause the inclusion of interest on the Bonds in gross income for
federal income tax purposes to be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. We
express no opinion regarding other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the
Bonds.

Introduction 

 
I. 
 
 
which will provide maximum security of principal invested with secondary emphasis on providing 
adequate liquidity to pool participants, achieving the highest yield while conforming to all 
applicable statutes and resolutions governing the investment of public funds.   
 

It is the policy of the San Mateo County Treasurer to invest public funds in a manner 

To meet liquidity and long term investing needs, the County has established the County 

Investment Pool.  This fund is suitable for planned expenditures or capital funds. 

Delegation of Authority 

II.  
 

By Resolution #073015, effective February 11, 2014, the County Board of Supervisors 

has delegated to the Treasurer authority to invest and reinvest the funds of the County and 
other depositors as specified in California Government Code Sections §27000.1 and §53607 for 
the period calendar year 2014. The Treasurer may delegate investment authority to such 
persons within the Treasurer’s Department as deemed appropriate. 
 
III. 
 

Policy Statement 

 The Treasurer will annually render to the Board of Supervisors and any Oversight 

This Investment Policy establishes cash management and investment guidelines for the 
Treasurer, and those to whom he/she delegates investment authority, who are responsible for 
the stewardship of the San Mateo County Pooled Investment Fund.  Each transaction and the 
entire portfolio must comply with California Government Code and this Policy.  All portfolio 
activities will be monitored and judged by the standards of this Policy and its investment 
objectives.  Activities that violate its spirit and intent will be considered contrary to policy. 
 
 
Committee a statement of investment policy, which the Board shall review and approve at a 
public meeting.  Any change in the policy shall also be reviewed and approved by the Board at a 
public meeting. 
 
IV. 
 
 
The Treasurer is a fiduciary of the pooled investment fund and therefore subject to the 
prudent investor standard.  The Treasurer, employees involved in the investment process and  
members of the San Mateo County Treasury Oversight Committee shall refrain from all personal 
business activities that could conflict with the management of the investment program.

All individuals involved will be required to report all gifts and income in accordance with 
California state law.  (See Section XXI) 
 

When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling and managing 

public funds, the Treasurer, and those to whom he/she delegates investment authority, shall act 
with due professional care, skill, prudence and diligence taking into consideration circumstances 
then prevailing, including, but limited to, general economic conditions  and anticipated needs of 
the County and other depositors.  This should be accomplished with the care that a prudent 
person acting in a like capacity would use to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity 
needs of the County and other depositors. 
 

As outlined in the California Government Code Section §27000.3, the standard of 

Investment Objectives 

prudence to be used by the County investment officers shall be the “prudent investor” standard 
and shall be applied in the context of managing the portfolio.  Investment officers shall act in 
accordance with written procedures and the investment policy, exercise due diligence, report in 
a timely fashion, and implement appropriate controls for adverse development. 
 
V. 
 
 
while earning a reasonable rate of return while awaiting application for governmental purposes.  
Investments should be made with precision and care considering the safety of the principal 
investment, as well as the income to be derived from the investment.  The specific objectives for 
the program are ranked in order of importance: 
 

The San Mateo County Pool shall be prudently invested in order to preserve principal 

A.    Safety of Principal - The Treasurer shall seek to preserve principal and minimize 

 

capital losses by mitigating credit risk and market risk as follows: 

principal.  Credit risk shall be minimized by diversifying the fund among issues and 
issuers so that the failure of any one issue or issuer would not result in a 
significant loss of income or principal to participants.   Credit rating evaluations  
for all securities are monitored on a consistent basis. 

  Credit Risk - Defined as an issuer(s) ability and willingness to repay interest and 
 
 
 
 
  Market Risk - Defined as the risk of market value fluctuations due to changes in 
the general level of interest rates. Because longer-term securities generally have 
 
greater market risk than shorter-term securities; market risk will be minimized by 
 
establishing the maximum Weighted Average Maturity of the pool at three years.  
 
 
The maximum allowable maturity for any instrument in the pool at time of purchase 
is 7 years (Treasuries and Agencies only).  Occasional market losses on    
 
individual securities are inevitable with active portfolio management and must be 
 
 
considered within the context of the overall investment return. 

B. 

Liquidity  

 

The Treasurer’s Office attempts to match maturities with its 15 month projected 
cash flow.  The nature of the planning process behind the cash flow of the pool is 
relatively predictable and less volatile than is the case of discretionary money.

Annual Investment Policy of the Pooled Investment Fund                                                             Calendar Year 2014 

 
This allows leeway for some of the underlying investments in the County Pool to 
maintain a somewhat longer duration. 

C. 

Yield  

The County Pool is designed as an income fund to maximize the return on 
investable funds over various market cycles, consistent with the pool’s first priority 
of safeguarding principal.  Yield will be considered only after the basic 
requirements of safety and liquidity have been met.  The County Pool is managed 
as an income fund whose purpose is to provide its investors with a reasonably 
predictable level of income, as opposed to a growth fund or fund measured on the 
basis of total return.  

 

 

  

 

 
VI.   Management Style and Strategy 
 

This policy describes the County’s strategic investment objective, risk tolerance and 
investment constraints.  The County Treasurer or designee, at the Treasurer’s discretion, 
prepares an economic outlook and evaluates the capital markets environment.  The investment 
programs reflect a common strategy that is based on conservative principles of fixed income 
portfolio management consistently applied in a disciplined fashion. 

VII.  Authorized Investments 

Subject to the limitations set forth in California Government Code §53600 et seq. which 

 
may be amended from time to time, the Treasurer may invest in the following instruments, 
subject to the limits described in the following sections.  Long-term credit ratings, where shown, 
specify the minimum credit rating category required at time of purchase without regard to 
modifiers (e.g. +/- or 1,2,3) if any.  As noted previously, all securities purchased shall be 
regularly monitored and re-evaluated should their ratings be downgraded below the minimum 
investment grade level required of the Pool.  The Treasury Oversight  
Committee will be notified, within 10 days of any security downgrades that fall below the pool’s 
investment standards and the course of action to be taken if any.  In addition the information will 
be posted on the Treasurer’s website within the same time frame.  Decisions regarding the 
holding of, or the potential sale of, securities are based on factors such as remaining time to 
maturity and the need for liquidity in the Pool. 
 
 
Where a percentage limitation of eligible security percentages and maximum maturity is 
established, for the purpose of determining investment compliance, that maximum amount will 
be applied on the date of trade settlement.  Therefore, depending on the liquidation of other 
securities and the performance of other securities in the pool, the percentage of the pool of any 
given security or instrument could exceed the initial percentage limitations without violating the 
Investment Policy.

A. 
 

U.S. Treasury Securities 

United States Treasury bills, notes, bond or certificates of indebtedness, for which 
the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged for the payment of principal 
and interest.  The maximum maturity of U.S. Treasury Securities is 7 years. 

 
B.    U.S. Government Agency/GSE (Government Sponsored Enterprise)

C.     Commercial Paper 

 
At the time of purchase, commercial paper must be rated either A-1/P-1/F1 or

E.     Bankers Acceptance 
 

A Bankers Acceptance (BA) is a draft drawn and accepted by banks that is based 
upon funds that will pay its face value at maturity.  The security is normally traded 
at a discounted price. Because the accepting institution is obligated to pay for the 
bill, a Bankers Acceptance is considered less risky than commercial paper.

of the fund in any single issuer of Corporate Securities, however, the Pool has a 
target of holding no more than 3%.  The 3% target may be exceeded under 
exceptional  circumstances. (i.e.: peak tax collection periods, G.O. Bond 
issuances, etc.) when there is a large influx of cash. 

Repurchase Agreements 

Repurchase Agreements must be executed with dealers with whom the County 
has written agreements and are either banking institutions that meet the rating 
requirements of this policy or dealers who report to the Market Reports Division of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of N.Y. (Primary Dealers). All transactions must be 
collateralized at 102% of current value plus accrued interest and must be marked 
to market daily.  The only acceptable collateral for these transactions include 
Treasuries or Agencies with a maximum maturity of seven years. 
 
For purposes of this authorized investments section, the term “Repurchase 
Agreement” means a purchase of a security by the County pursuant to an 
agreement by which the seller will repurchase the securities on or before a 
specified date and for a specified dollar amount and will deliver the underlying 
securities to the County by book entry.  All County pool transactions are conducted 
through the County custodian on a payment vs. delivery basis.    When the 
transaction is unwound, the transfer of the underlying securities will revert to the 
counter party’s bank account by book entry. The term “Counter party” means the 
other party to the transaction with the County.  The Counter Party, or its parent, 
must have a short-term rating of  A-1, P-1 or F1 by at least two  of the three 
nationally recognized rating services (S&P, Moody’s and Fitch).  The maximum 
allowable term of a repurchase agreement shall not exceed 92 days. 
 
Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) 

The Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) is an investment fund run by the 
Treasurer of the State of California to pool local agency monies.  LAIF will be used 
as a comparative fund to the County’s pool.  The maximum percent of the fund 
that can be invested is up to the current State limit. 

Registered Warrants 

In accordance with Government Code §17202 – All registered warrants issued by 
the state are legal investments for all: 

1.   Trust funds. 
2.   Funds of all insurers.  
3.   Funds of savings and loan associations. 
4.   Funds of all banks, including any legal combination of commercial 

banks, savings banks and trust companies.  

5.   Funds of all counties, municipal corporations, districts, public 

corporations, political subdivisions, or state agencies.

not exceed 10%. 

Security Lending is a temporary exchange of portfolio assets for acceptable collateral 

 
VIII.  Security Lending 
 
 
between a lender and an approved borrower.  The additional income generated from this 
transaction can be used to enhance portfolio performance.  This process can be summarized in 
three key steps: 
 

The Security Lending agent lends securities from our portfolio to an approved 
borrower at a negotiated rate.  The negotiated rate is dependent upon the level of 
demand for the securities. 

A. 

 
B. 

 
C. 

 

The Security Lending agent invests the cash collateral in highly liquid, short 
duration, high credit quality instruments approved by our investment policy. 

The earnings generated net of rebates from these transactions are split between 
the third party agent and the County based on the contract agreement. 

Our contract with The Bank of New York requires daily reporting of the securities 

 
 
borrowed, the borrowers, and the short term investments made with the collateral.  The County 
retains the right to recall securities at any given time; cutoffs are 9:30 a.m. eastern standard 
time for same day recalls of treasuries/agencies and 1:30 p.m. eastern standard time on trade 
date for corporates.  We also require acknowledgement of the County Investment Policy, and 
check the adherence to that policy daily.  
 
 
 
All securities purchased with any funds received as a result of such lending shall be 
regularly monitored and re-evaluated.  Should their ratings fall below the pool’s investment 
standards, the Treasury Oversight Committee will be notified within 10 days of any security 
downgrades that fall below the pool’s investment standards and the course of action if any.  In 
addition the information will be posted on the Treasurer’s website within the same time frame.   
 
 
 
Additionally, the percentage of the Fund’s market value in any one issuer’s securities 
shall be regularly monitored and the Treasury Oversight Committee will be notified within 10 
days, and the information posted on the Treasurer’s website, of any instances where the  
percentage of the Fund’s market value in any one issuer’s securities exceeds the percentage 
limitations set forth herein or where there is any change in diversification and the course of 
action, if any. 
 
There are always risks in any financial transaction.  The three most common risks in Security 
Lending are as follows:

A. 

 
B. 

 
C. 

Borrower Default Risk – Although rare, a borrower may not return a security in a 
timely manner.  To protect against this risk, we require 102% cash collateral,  
which is marked to market and monitored daily.  In the event of borrower default, 
the Security Lending agent is responsible for replacing the securities or providing 
the cash value of the securities.  In other words, The Bank of New York 
indemnifies the County of San Mateo against borrower default. 

Collateral Investment Risk – The value of the securities in which we invest the 
cash collateral may decline due to fluctuations in interest rates or other market  
related events.  This risk is controlled by investing in a huge investment pool with 
highly liquid short duration, high credit quality instruments identified in this 
investment policy. 

Operational Risks – critical operations, such as maintaining the value of the 
collateral, collecting interest and dividend payments are essential to a smooth 
running Security Lending operation.  Operational risks are the responsibility of the 
Security Lending agent.  We further mitigate this risk by reviewing all transactions 
and collateral requirements on a daily basis. 

Schedule 1 – Securities Lending 

  No more than 5% of the Pool can be on loan to any single counterparty. 
  A single loan shall not exceed 3% of the total portfolio. 
  The maximum maturity of a securities loan shall not exceed 92 days.

this fund is in order of priority: preservation of principal, liquidity and then yield.  The policy of 
maintaining a maximum dollar weighted maturity or weighted average maturity (WAM) of 3 
years leaves open the flexibility to take advantage of interest rate trends to maximize the return 
on investment. The imposed maximum 3 year average maturity limits the market risk to levels 
appropriate to a short, intermediate income fund.  The word “Maturity” refers to the instrument’s 
stated legal final redemption date - not coupon reset, put or call dates.

Treasurer to correct such matter as soon as practical.  If a percentage restriction is adhered to  
at the time of purchase, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in 
values or assets will not constitute a violation of that restriction.

For earnings calculations, investments will be carried at original purchase cost 
(plus purchased accrued interest, if applicable).  Premiums or discounts acquired 
in the purchase of securities will be amortized or accreted over the life of the 
respective securities.  For GASB purposes, investments will be carried at cost and 
marked to market.   

Gains or losses from investment sales will be credited or charged to investment 
income at the time of sale.  All interest income, gains/ losses are posted quarterly. 

Premiums paid for callable securities will be amortized to the 1st call date after 
purchase. 

Purchased accrued interest will be capitalized until the first interest payment is 
received.  Upon receipt of the first interest payment, the funds will be used to  
reduce the investment to its principal cost with the remaining balance credited to 
investment income. 

Yield is calculated on an accrual basis using a 365-day calendar year.  Earnings 
are calculated as follows: 

 

 (Earnings* + Capital Gains) - (Banking Cost +Fees+Amortized Premiums + Capital  

Losses) 

Average Daily Pool Balance 

 

 

* Earnings equal net interest payments + accrued interest + accreted discounts. 

The County Pool is operated as a single investment pool in which the banking and 
reporting services, required by the participant, will determine level of charges 
assigned to the account.  Funds that generate specific volume of related banking 
charges such as payroll, extra reporting, etc. (variable costs) will be charged both 
fixed and variable banking costs as well as administrative fees before interest 
allocation and will be designated as Pool 1.  Those funds that do not generate 
excessive banking cost but utilize the basic banking services (fixed costs) will be 
designated as Pool 2 and charged fixed banking costs and administrative fees.  
The final classification is designated as Pool 3 and represents those funds that

have only an incidental use of the County banking system and therefore only pay 
administrative fees. 

Effective July 1, 2014, the 3-pool accounting methodology will be eliminated.   The 
County Pool will be operated as a single investment pool.  Banking and reporting 
services required by a participant will be charged directly to the participant.  All 
participants will be charged an administrative fee. 

The administrative fee is 11.5 basis points and will be evaluated annually.

XIV.  Safekeeping 

  All deliverable security transactions, including collateral for repurchase agreements, 

 
entered into by the Treasurer shall be conducted on a Delivery-versus-Payment basis (DVP)  

  All deliverable securities shall be held by a third party custodian designated by the 

 
Treasurer.  The third party custodian shall be required to issue a safekeeping statement to the 
Treasurer listing the specific instrument, rate, maturity and other pertinent information. 

The Treasurer shall submit monthly, quarterly and annual reports, in compliance with 

XV.  Performance Evaluation  
 
 
Government Code Sections §53607, §53646 and §27134, to the Treasury Oversight Committee, 
Pool participants and the Board of Supervisors.  These reports shall contain sufficient 
information to permit an informed outside reader to evaluate the performance of the investment 
program and shall be in compliance with Government Code.  This includes the type of

G. Loss Control  
 
While this Investment Policy is based on “the Prudent Investor Rule”, the Treasurer shall  
seek to enhance total portfolio return by means of actively managing the portfolio.  In any

realized and judged within the context of overall portfolio performance.  Losses shall be 
allocated as otherwise described in this policy in section XIII, entitled “Method of  
Accounting”. 

 
H. Credit Quality   
Should any investment or financial institution represented in the portfolio, be

disposition of that asset and will so advise the County Treasury Oversight Committee.  The 
situation will be monitored daily by the Treasurer until  final disposition has been made. 
 
I. Approved Brokers  
 
The Treasurer will maintain a current list of Approved Brokers and Dealers who   may 
conduct business with the County.  All financial institutions on the approved list will be 
evaluated individually, with preference given to primary dealers, who possess a strong 
capital and credit base appropriate to their operations.  The Treasurer will forward a copy 
of the County Investment Policy to all approved brokers and require written 
acknowledgment of the policy from the broker.   

No broker, brokerage, dealer or securities firm is allowed on the approved  list if,   within 
any consecutive 48-month period, they have made a political contribution in an amount 
exceeding the limitations contained in Rule G-37 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking 
Board, to the local Treasurer, any member of the governing   board of the local agency or 
any candidate for those offices.

brokers before executing a security transaction whenever possible.  Exceptions 
will occur with Treasuries. In those cases the Bloomberg screen will be printed as 
close to the actual executed price as possible. In the case of money market, 
agencies or corporate securities, a best effort will be made to obtain differential 
bids and offers. 

E.  Repurchase Agreements   All Repurchase Agreements with approved dealers will 

be governed by a Public Securities Association (PSA) agreement that has been 
approved in writing by the Treasurer. 

F.  Confirmations resulting from securities purchased or sold under a Repurchase 
Agreement shall state the exact and complete nomenclature of the underlying 
securities bought or sold, as well as the term structure (i.e. maturity) of the 
transaction.

the custodial bank. 

H.  The assets of the County shall be held in safekeeping by the County’s safekeeping 
agent, or secured through third-party custody and safekeeping procedures.  A due

the Treasurer has a list of those securities that are out on loan.  Interest earned 
will be monitored daily and compared to the monthly report of earnings by the 
custodial bank.

day. Union Bank is currently the pools bank.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS 

 
ACCRUED INTEREST 
Interest that has accumulated but has not yet been paid from the most recent interest payment 
date or issue date to a certain date. 
BANKERS’ ACCEPTANCE 
A time bill of exchange drawn on and accepted by a commercial bank to finance the exchange 
of goods. When a bank “accepts” such a bill, the time draft becomes, in effect, a predated, 
certified check payable to the bearer at some future specified date. Little risk is involved for the 
investor because the commercial bank assumes primary liability once the draft is accepted. 
BASIS POINT 
One basis point is equal to 1/100 of one percent. For example, if interest rates increase from 
4.25% to 4.50%, the difference is referred to as a 25-basis-point increase. 
BENCHMARK 
A comparative base for measuring the performance or risk tolerance of the investment portfolio.  
A benchmark should represent a close correlation to the level of risk and the average duration of 
the portfolio’s investments. 
BID 
The price at which a buyer offers to buy a security. 
BOND 
A bond is essentially a loan made by an investor to a division of the government, a government 
agency or a corporation.  The bond is a promissory note to repay the loan in full at the end of a 
fixed time period.  The date on which the principal must be repaid is the called the maturity date 
or maturity.  In addition, the issuer of the bond, that is, the agency or corporation receiving the 
loan proceeds and issuing the promissory note, agrees to make regular payments of interest at 
a rate initially stated on the bond.  Bonds are rated according to many factors, including cost, 
degree of risk and rate of income. 
BOOK VALUE 
The value of a held security as carried in the records of an investor. May differ from current 
market value of the security. 
BROKER/DEALER 
Any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities in this state for the 
account of others or for her/his own account. Broker/dealer also includes a person engaged in 
the regular business of issuing or guaranteeing options with regard to securities not of her/his 
own issue. 
CALLABLE SECURITIES 
An investment security that contains an option allowing the issuer to retire the security prior to 
its final maturity date. 
COMMERCIAL PAPER 
Short-term, unsecured promissory notes issued in either registered or bearer form and usually 
backed by a line of credit with a bank. Maturities do not exceed 270 days and generally average 
30-45 days. 
COUPON RATE 
The annual rate of interest payable on a security expressed as a percentage of the principal 
amount. 
COVERED BOND                                                                                                                          
A covered or mortgage bond is an on-balance sheet obligation of the issuing institution.

CREDIT RISK 
The risk to an investor that an issuer will default in the payment of interest and/or principal on a 
security. 
CURRENT YIELD 
The annual income from an investment divided by the current market value. Since the 
mathematical calculation relies on the current market value rather than the investor’s cost, 
current yield is unrelated to the actual return the investor will earn if the security is held to 
maturity. 
CUSIP NUMBERS 
CUSIP is an acronym for Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures. CUSIP 
numbers are identification numbers assigned each maturity of a security issue and usually 
printed on the face of each individual security in the issue. The CUSIP numbers are intended to 
facilitate identification and clearance of securities. 
DISCOUNT 
The amount by which the par value of a security exceeds the price paid for the security. 
DIVERSIFICATION 
Dividing investment funds among a variety of securities offering independent returns. 
DURATION 
The weighted average time to maturity of a bond where the weights are the present values of 
future cash flows.  Duration measures the price sensitivity of a bond to changes in interest rates. 
EARNINGS APPORTIONMENT 
The quarterly interest distribution to the Pool Participants where the actual investment costs 
incurred by the Treasurer are deducted from the interest earnings of the Pool. 
FAIR VALUE 
The amount at which an investment could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing 
parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. 
FEDERAL FUNDS 
Funds placed in Federal Reserve banks by depository institutions in excess of current reserve 
requirements. These depository institutions may lend Fed funds to each other overnight or on a 
longer basis. They may also transfer funds among each other on a same-day basis through the 
Federal Reserve banking system. Fed funds are considered to be immediately available funds. 
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
Interest rate at which banks lend federal funds to each other. 
FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE (FOMC)

securities in the open market as a means of influencing the volume of bank credit and money. 
FIDUCIARY 
An individual who holds something in trust for another and bears liability for its safekeeping. 
FLOATING RATE NOTE 
A debt security whose interest rate is reset periodically (monthly, quarterly, annually) and is 
based on a market index (e.g. Treasury bills, LIBOR, etc.). 
FUTURES 
Commodities, which are sold to be delivered at a future date 
INTEREST 
The amount earned while owning a debt security, generally calculated as a percentage of the 
principal amount.

of the security; the amount of money due at maturity. Par value should not be confused with 
market value. 
PREMIUM 
The amount by which the price paid for a security exceeds the security’s par value. 
PRIME RATE 
A preferred interest rate charged by commercial banks to their most creditworthy customers. 
Many interest rates are keyed to this rate. 
RATE OF RETURN 
The yield obtainable on a security based on its purchase price or its current market price.  This 
may be the amortized yield to maturity on a bond and the current income return. 
REPURCHASE AGREEMENT OR RP OR REPO 
An agreement consisting of two simultaneous transactions whereby the investor purchases 
securities from a bank or dealer and the bank or dealer agrees to repurchase the securities at

the same price on a certain future date. The interest rate on a RP is that which the dealer pays 
the investor for the use of his funds. Reverse repurchase agreements are the mirror image of  
the RPs when the bank or dealer purchases securities from the investor under an agreement to 
sell them back to the investor. 
SAFEKEEPING 
A service to customers rendered by banks for a fee whereby securities and valuables of all 
types and descriptions are held by the bank in the customer’s name. 
SECURITIES LENDING 
A transaction wherein the Treasurer’s Pool transfers its securities to broker/dealers and other 
entities for collateral which may be cash or securities and simultaneously agrees to return the 
collateral for the same securities in the future. 
SETTLEMENT DATE 
The date on which the purchase or sale of securities is executed.  For example, in a purchase 
transaction, the day securities are physically delivered or wired to the buyer in exchange for 
cash is the settlement date. 
STRIPs 
Bonds, usually issued by the U.S. Treasury, whose two components, interest and repayment of 
principal, are separated and sold individually as zero-coupon bonds.  Strips are an acronym for 
Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities. 
TRADE DATE 
The date and time corresponding to an investor’s commitment to buy or sell a security. 
U.S. AGENCY OBLIGATIONS 
Federal agency or United States government-sponsored enterprise obligations, participants, or 
other instruments.  The obligations are issued by or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest 
by federal agencies or United States government-sponsored enterprises.  Issuers include: 
Fannie Mae, Farmer Mac, Federal Farm Credit Banks, Freddie Mac, Federal Home Loan 
Banks, Financing Corporation, Tennessee Valley Authority, Resolution Trust Funding 
Corporation, World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and PEFCO. 
U.S. TREASURY OBLIGATIONS (TREASURIES) 
Securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and backed by the full faith and credit of the United 
States.  Treasuries are considered to have no credit risk and are the benchmark for interest 
rates on all other securities in the U.S. and overseas.  The Treasury issues both discounted 
securities and fixed coupon notes and bonds. 
WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY 
The remaining average maturity of all securities held in a portfolio. 
YIELD 
The rate of annual income return on an investment, expressed as a percentage.  Yield does not 
include capital gains.  (a) INCOME YIELD is obtained by dividing the current dollar income by 
the current market price for the security.  (b) NET YIELD or YIELD TO MATURITY is the current 
income yield minus any premium above par or plus any discount from par in purchase price, 
with the adjustment spread over the period from the date of purchase to the date of maturity of 
the bond. 
ZERO-COUPON BOND 
A bond on which interest is not payable until maturity (or earlier redemption), but compounds 
periodically to accumulate to a stated maturity amount.  Zero-coupon bonds are typically issued 
at a discount and repaid at par upon maturity.

APPENDIX F

BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM

The information in this appendix has been provided by DTC for use in securities offering
documents, and the District takes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness thereof. The District
cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC, DTC Participants or Indirect Participants will
distribute the Beneficial Owners either (a) payments of interest, principal or premium, if any, with respect
to the Refunding Bonds or (b) certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation of
ownership interest in the Refunding Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis or that DTC, DTC
Direct Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this Official
Statement.

1.

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, New York, will act as securities
depository for the Refunding Bonds (the “Securities”). The Securities will be issued as fully-registered
securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may
be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Security certificate will be
issued for each maturity of the Securities, in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be
deposited with DTC. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any issue exceeds $500 million, one
certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount, and an additional
certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue.

2.

DTC,

the world’s largest securities depository,

is a limited-purpose trust company
organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New
York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the
meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the
provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset
servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt
issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct
Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants
of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-
entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical
movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers
and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the
holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated
subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S.
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect
Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants
are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at
www.dtcc.com.

3.

Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct
Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of
each actual purchaser of each Security (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and
Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their
purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of
the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant
through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the

F-1

Securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting
on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their
ownership interests in Securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Securities is
discontinued.

4.

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct Participants with
DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may
be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Securities with DTC and their
registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial
ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Securities; DTC’s records
reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Securities are credited, which
may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible
for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

5.

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by
Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to
Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory
requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to take
certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the
Securities, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Security documents.
For example, Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the
Securities for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the
alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request
that copies of notices be provided directly to them.

6.

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Securities within an issue
are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct
Participant in such issue to be redeemed.

7.

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with
respect to the Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI
Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the District as soon as possible
after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those
Direct Participants to whose accounts the Securities are credited on the record date (identified in a listing
attached to the Omnibus Proxy).

8.

Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Securities will be
made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.
DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding
detail information from the District or the Paying Agent, on payable date in accordance with their
respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be
governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the
accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such
Participant and not of DTC, the Paying Agent or the District, subject to any statutory or regulatory
requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions and
dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized
representative of DTC) is the responsibility of the District or the Paying Agent, disbursement of such
payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to
the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.

F-2

9.

DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Securities at
any time by giving reasonable notice to the District or Paying Agent. Under such circumstances, in the
event that a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificates are required to be printed and
delivered.

10.

The District may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers
through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Security certificates will be printed and
delivered to DTC.

11.

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been
obtained from sources that the District believes to be reliable, but the District takes no responsibility for
the accuracy thereof.

BUILD  AMERICA  MUTUAL  ASSURANCE  COMPANY  (“BAM”),  for  consideration  received,  hereby  UNCONDITIONALLY  AND 
IRREVOCABLY agrees to pay to the trustee (the “Trustee”) or paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the Bonds named above (as set forth in the 
documentation providing for the issuance and securing of the Bonds), for the benefit of the Owners or, at the election of BAM, directly to each 
Owner, subject only to the terms of this Policy (which includes each endorsement hereto), that portion of the principal of and interest on the Bonds 
that shall become Due for Payment but shall be unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Issuer. 
 

On the later of the day on which such principal and interest becomes Due for Payment or the first Business Day following the Business Day 
on which BAM shall have received Notice of Nonpayment, BAM will disburse (but without duplication in the case of duplicate claims for the same 
Nonpayment)  to  or  for  the  benefit  of  each  Owner  of  the  Bonds,  the  face  amount  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  that is  then  Due  for 
Payment but is then unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Issuer, but only upon receipt by BAM, in a form reasonably satisfactory to it, of (a) 
evidence of the Owner’s right to receive payment of such  principal or interest then Due for Payment and (b) evidence, including any appropriate 
instruments of assignment, that all of the Owner’s rights with respect to payment of such principal or interest that is Due for Payment shall thereupon 
vest in BAM. A Notice of Nonpayment will be deemed received on a given Business Day if it is received prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on such 
Business Day; otherwise, it will be deemed received on the next Business Day.  If any Notice of Nonpayment received by BAM is incomplete, it 
shall be deemed not to have been received by BAM for purposes of the preceding sentence, and BAM shall promptly so advise the Trustee, Paying 
Agent or Owner, as appropriate, any of whom may submit an amended Notice of Nonpayment.  Upon disbursement under this Policy in respect of a 
Bond and to the extent of such payment, BAM shall become the owner of such Bond, any appurtenant coupon to such Bond and right to receipt of 
payment of principal of or interest on such Bond and shall be fully subrogated to the rights of the Owner, including the Owner’s right to receive 
payments under such Bond. Payment by BAM either to the Trustee or Paying Agent for the benefit of the Owners, or directly to the Owners, on 
account of any Nonpayment shall discharge the obligation of BAM under this Policy with respect to said Nonpayment. 
 

Except to the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, the following terms shall have the meanings specified for all purposes of 
this Policy.  “Business Day” means any day other than (a) a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on which banking institutions in the State of New York 
or the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent (as defined herein) are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.  “Due for Payment” means (a) 
when referring to the principal of a Bond, payable on the stated maturity date thereof or the date on which the same shall have been duly called for 
mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call for redemption (other than by 
mandatory  sinking  fund  redemption),  acceleration  or  other  advancement  of  maturity  (unless  BAM  shall  elect,  in  its  sole  discretion,  to  pay  such 
principal due upon such acceleration together with any accrued interest to the date of acceleration) and (b) when referring to interest on a Bond, 
payable on the stated date for payment of interest. “Nonpayment” means, in respect of a Bond, the failure of the Issuer to have provided sufficient 
funds to the Trustee or, if there is no Trustee, to the Paying Agent for payment in full of all principal and interest that is Due for Payment on such 
Bond.  “Nonpayment” shall also include, in respect of a Bond, any payment made to an Owner by or on behalf of the Issuer of principal or interest 
that is Due for Payment, which payment has been recovered from such Owner pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code in accordance with a 
final, nonappealable order of a court having competent jurisdiction.  “Notice” means delivery to BAM of a notice of claim and certificate, by certified 
mail, email or telecopy as set forth on the attached Schedule or other acceptable electronic delivery, in a form satisfactory to BAM, from and signed 
by an Owner, the Trustee or the Paying Agent, which notice shall specify (a) the person or entity making the claim, (b) the Policy Number, (c) the 
claimed amount, (d) payment instructions and (e) the date such claimed amount becomes or became Due for Payment.  “Owner” means, in respect of 
a Bond, the person or entity who, at the time of Nonpayment, is entitled under the terms of such Bond to payment thereof, except that “Owner” shall 
not include the Issuer, the Member or any other person or entity whose direct or indirect obligation constitutes the underlying security for the Bonds. 
  

!

BAM may appoint a fiscal agent (the “Insurer’s Fiscal Agent”) for purposes of this Policy by giving written notice to the Trustee, the 
Paying Agent, the Member and the Issuer specifying the name and notice address of the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent.  From and after the date of receipt of 
such notice by the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Member or the Issuer (a) copies of all notices required to be delivered to BAM pursuant to this 
Policy shall be simultaneously delivered to the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent and to BAM and shall not be deemed received until received by both and (b) all 
payments required to be made by BAM under this Policy may be made directly by BAM or by the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent on behalf of BAM.  The 
Insurer’s Fiscal Agent is the agent of BAM only, and the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent shall in no event be liable to the Trustee, Paying Agent or any Owner 
for any act of the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent or any failure of BAM to deposit or cause to be deposited sufficient funds to make payments due under this 
Policy. 
 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, BAM agrees not to assert, and hereby waives, only for the benefit of each Owner, all 
rights  (whether  by  counterclaim,  setoff  or  otherwise)  and  defenses  (including,  without  limitation,  the  defense  of  fraud),  whether  acquired  by 
subrogation, assignment or otherwise, to the extent that such rights and defenses may be available to BAM to avoid payment of its obligations under 
this Policy in accordance with the express provisions of this Policy.  This Policy may not be canceled or revoked. 
 

This Policy sets forth in full the undertaking of BAM and shall not be modified, altered or affected by any other agreement or instrument, 
including any modification or amendment thereto.  Except to the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, any premium paid in respect of 
this Policy is nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever, including payment, or provision being made for payment, of the Bonds prior to maturity. 
THIS POLICY IS NOT COVERED BY THE PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE SECURITY FUND SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 76 OF THE 
NEW YORK INSURANCE LAW.  THIS POLICY IS ISSUED WITHOUT CONTINGENT MUTUAL LIABILITY FOR ASSESSMENT.
