In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the District, based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and 
court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is 
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and is exempt from State of California 
personal income taxes.  In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of federal individual 
or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although Bond Counsel observes that it is included in adjusted current earnings in calculating federal corporate 
alternative minimum taxable income.  Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences caused by the ownership or disposition of, 
or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.  See “TAX MATTERS” herein.

Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”).  Payments of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on

with respect to the District’s outstanding Revenue Certificates of Participation (2003 Water System Project).  In the Indenture, the District has covenanted 
that it will fix, prescribe and collect rates, fees and charges for use of the District’s Water System during each fiscal year, which are at least sufficient to yield

this Official Statement.

It

Purpose and Authority for Issuance of the Bonds

The Bonds are being issued primarily to provide funds to refund the District’s
outstanding 1998 Water System Refunding Revenue Bonds, currently outstanding in the
aggregate principal amount of $29,340,000 (the “Prior Bonds”). The Prior Bonds were
originally executed and delivered to provide funds to refinance the acquisition and construction
of facilities for the storage, transmission and treatment of water for the District’s Water System
(the “Water System”). The Indenture defines “Water System” as all facilities for the pumping,
storage, transmission and treatment of water now owned by the District and all other properties,
structures or works hereafter acquired and constructed by the District and determined to be a part
of the Water System, together with all additions, betterments, extensions or improvements to
such facilities, properties, structures or works or any part
thereof hereafter acquired and
constructed.

The Bonds are authorized pursuant to the provisions of Articles 10 and 11 of Chapter 3 of
Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code (commencing with
Section 53570), a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors of the District on September 10,
2009 (the “District Resolution”), and an Indenture (the “Indenture”), dated as of October 1, 2009,
between the District and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).

The proceeds from the sale of the Bonds will be used by the District (i) to refund the
Prior Bonds, (ii) establish a reserve fund for the Bonds, and (iii) pay the costs of issuing the
Bonds. See “THE REFUNDING PLAN” herein.

1

The District

The District is a special district formed under California law. The District is located in
southern Alameda County along the southeastern shore of San Francisco Bay in the State of
California (the “State”). It includes the cities of Fremont, Newark and Union City, and serves a
population of approximately 333,648 as of January 2009. The District provides water service
and bears the responsibility for the groundwater supply in its service area.

Sources of Payment for the Bonds

Indenture. The Bonds are payable from and secured by a (i) first pledge of and lien on
Net Revenues (as hereinafter defined) received from the operation of the District’s Water
System. “Net Revenues” means, for any period, an amount equal to all of the Revenues (as
hereinafter defined) received during such period less the amount of Maintenance and Operation
Costs becoming payable during such period. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Net
Revenues; Pledge of Net Revenues.”

Rate Covenant.

In the Indenture, the District has covenanted that it will fix, prescribe
and collect rates, fees and charges for the services and facilities furnished by the District’s Water
System during each fiscal year, which are at least sufficient to yield in each fiscal year Net
Revenues equal to 125 percent of the Debt Service for such fiscal year, plus any amount
necessary to restore the Bond Reserve Fund to the Reserve Requirement. See “SECURITY FOR
THE BONDS – Rate Covenant.”

Parity Obligations. Additional obligations and bonds issued or incurred on a parity with
or subordinate to the Bonds may be issued pursuant to the Indenture provided that certain
conditions are met. The District executed and delivered $25,000,000 of Revenue Certificates of
Participation (2003 Water System Project) in 2003 (the “2003 Certificates”). The Bonds, when
issued, will be secured by a pledge of Net Revenues on a parity with the District’s obligation to
to the 2003
make installment payments (the “2003 Installment Payments”) with respect
Certificates.
See
“SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Parity Obligations.”

There are currently $25,000,000 in outstanding 2003 Certificates.

Neither the Bonds nor the obligation to pay principal of or interest thereon
constitutes a debt of the District, the State or any of its political subdivisions within the
meaning of any constitutional limitation on indebtedness, or a pledge of the full faith and
credit of the District. The Bonds are secured solely by the pledge of Net Revenues of the
District and certain funds held under the Indenture.

Continuing Disclosure

The District has covenanted for the benefit of owners of the Bonds to provide certain
financial information and operating data relating to the District by not later than seven months
after the end of the District’s fiscal year (which is currently June 30) in each year commencing
with the report for the 2008-09 Fiscal Year (the “Annual Report”) and to provide notices of the
occurrence of certain enumerated events, if material. The Annual Report and notices of material
events will all be filed with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. These covenants have
been made in order to assist
the Underwriters in complying with Securities Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12(b)(5) (the “Rule”). The specific nature of the information to be

2

contained in the Annual Report or the notices of material events by the District is set forth in
APPENDIX C – “Form of Continuing Disclosure Agreement.” The District has not previously
defaulted on any obligation to provide an annual report in accordance with the Rule with respect
to any bond issue of the District.

Authority for Issuance

THE BONDS

The Bonds are authorized pursuant to the provisions of Articles 10 and 11 of Chapter 3 of
Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code (commencing with
Section 53570), the District Resolution, and the Indenture.

General Provisions

Repayment of the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully registered bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof and will be dated their date of delivery.
Interest on the Bonds will be payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year
(each, an “Interest Payment Date”), commencing June 1, 2010, by check mailed by the Trustee
on the Interest Payment Date to the person whose name appears in the registration books kept by
the Trustee as the registered owner thereof as of the close of business on the fifteenth day of the
month immediately preceding an interest payment date (the “Record Date”); provided, however,
that payment of interest will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to DTC, so
long as the Bonds are held in book-entry only form. Interest on the Bonds shall be calculated
based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

Each Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of
registration thereof, unless such date of registration is an Interest Payment Date, in which event
such Bond will bear interest from such date, or unless such date of registration is prior to the first
Interest Payment Date, in which event such Bond will bear interest from its dated date.

The Bonds will initially be issued in book-entry only form, registered in the name of
Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. Purchasers of the Bonds will not receive certificates
representing their interests therein, which will be held at DTC. See “THE BONDS – Book-Entry
Only System.”

The Bonds will mature in the amounts and on the dates, and bear interest at the rates per
annum, set forth on the cover page of this Official Statement. Principal of and premium, if any,
on the Bonds are payable upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the principal office of
the Trustee in San Francisco, California.

No Redemption

The Bonds are not subject to redemption prior to maturity.

THE REFUNDING PLAN

The Bonds are being issued to refund the District’s outstanding 1998 Water System
Refunding Revenue Bonds, currently outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of
$29,340,000 (the “Prior Bonds”).

Proceeds of the Bonds, together with certain funds made available through the defeasance
of the Prior Bonds, will be deposited pursuant to that certain Escrow Agreement, dated as of
October 1, 2009 (the “Escrow Agreement”), by and between the District and U.S. Bank National
Association as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), and will be applied to pay the redemption
price of all Prior Bonds on November 13, 2009, as well as the accrued interest to such date.

The funds deposited with the Escrow Agent will be applied to the purchase of direct
obligations of the United States of America (including obligations issued or held in book-entry
form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States) (the “Escrow
Securities”). The foregoing deposit with the Escrow Agent will result in the defeasance of the
Prior Bonds, pursuant to the provisions of the financing documents under which they were
delivered, as of the date of execution and delivery of the Bonds. See “VERIFICATION OF
MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY.”

The Escrow Securities and other moneys held by the Escrow Agent are pledged to the
payment of the Prior Bonds. Neither the principal of the Escrow Securities deposited with the
Escrow Agent nor the interest thereon will be available for the payment of the Bonds.

SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

Net Revenues; Pledge of Net Revenues

The Indenture provides that the principal of the Bonds and the interest and redemption
premium, if any, thereon are payable from Net Revenues. The Indenture provides for a first and
exclusive lien on the Net Revenues for payment of the Bonds and for payment of all other
Installment Purchase Contracts and water revenue bonds issued pursuant to the Indenture. See
“SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Parity Obligations” herein.

“Net Revenues” are defined in the Indenture as, for any designated period, the Revenues

during such period, less the Maintenance and Operation Costs during such period.

“Revenues” are defined in the Indenture as all gross income and revenue received or
receivable by the District from the ownership or operation of the Water System, determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including all rates, charges and
connection fees received by the District for water and the other services of the Water System and
all proceeds of insurance covering business interruption loss relating to the Water System and all
other income and revenue howsoever derived by the District from the ownership or operation of
the Water System, but excluding all proceeds of taxes and all refundable deposits made to
establish credit and advances or contributions in aid of construction.

“Maintenance and Operation Costs” are defined in the Indenture as the reasonable and
necessary costs paid or incurred by the District for maintaining and operating the Water System,
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including all costs of
water purchased for the Water System (except those costs paid from taxes), and including all
reasonable expenses of management and repair and all other expenses necessary to maintain and
preserve the Water System in good repair and working order, and including all administrative

5

costs of the District that are charged directly or apportioned to the operation of the Water
System, such as salaries and wages of employees, overhead, taxes (if any) and insurance
premiums, and including all other reasonable and necessary costs of the District or charges
required to be paid by it to comply with the terms of the Indenture and of any resolution
authorizing the execution of any Installment Purchase Contract or of such Installment Purchase
Contract or of any resolution or indenture authorizing the issuance of any Bonds or of such
Bonds, such as compensation, reimbursement and indemnification of the trustee, seller or lessor
for any such Installment Purchase Contracts or Bonds and fees and expenses of Independent
Certified Public Accountants and Independent Engineers, but excluding in all cases depreciation,
replacement and obsolescence charges or reserves therefor and amortization of intangibles.

Revenue Fund

In order to carry out and effectuate the pledge and lien of Net Revenues to payment of
debt service on the Bonds, the District agrees and covenants in the Indenture that all Revenues
shall be received by the District in trust under the Indenture and shall be deposited when and as
received into the Alameda County Water District Water Revenue Fund (the “Revenue Fund”),
which fund the District agrees and covenants to maintain so long as any Bonds remain
Outstanding, and all money in the Revenue Fund shall be applied and used as set forth below.

The District is obligated under the Indenture to pay all Maintenance and Operation Costs
(including amounts reasonably required to be set aside in contingency reserves for Maintenance
and Operation Costs the payment of which is not then immediately required) from the Revenue
Fund as they become due and payable, and all remaining money in the Revenue Fund shall be
deposited by the District at the following times into the following respective special accounts in
the following order of priority:

(a)

(b)

Bond Redemption Fund (which fund will be held by the Trustee); and

Bond Reserve Fund (which fund will be held by the Trustee).

All money in each of such funds shall be held in trust and shall be applied, used and

withdrawn only for the purposes hereinafter authorized in this section.

On June 1 of each year, all remaining money in the Revenue Fund, after the deposits to
the Bond Redemption Fund and the Bond Reserve Fund described below have been made, may
be withdrawn from the Revenue Fund and deposited by the District in such fund as it may
determine for expenditure for any lawful purpose of the District.

Bond Redemption Fund

The Indenture provides that on or before the fifth Business Day before June 1 and
December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2010, the District shall, from the money in the
Revenue Fund, transfer to the Trustee for deposit (on a parity with the deposits for the payment
of all other Installment Purchase Contracts and Bonds) in the Bond Redemption Fund a sum
equal to the amount of interest becoming due under the Indenture on the next succeeding June 1
or December 1, as the case may be, and on or before the fifth Business Day before June 1 of each
year, beginning June 1, 2010, the District shall, from money in the Revenue Fund, transfer to the
Trustee (on a parity with the transfers for the payment of all other Debt Service) for deposit in

6

the Bond Redemption Fund, a sum equal to the amount of principal becoming due under the
Indenture on the next succeeding June 1.

No deposit need be made in the Bond Redemption Fund if the amount available and
contained therein is at least equal to the amount of interest becoming due under the Indenture on
the next succeeding June 1 or December 1, as the case may be, plus the amount of principal
becoming due under the Indenture on the next succeeding June 1 or any sinking fund account
payment required to be made on the next succeeding June 1 into any sinking fund account, as the
case may be.

All money in the Bond Redemption Fund shall be used and withdrawn by the Trustee
solely for the purpose of paying the interest on and principal of the Bonds as such interest and
principal becomes due and payable.

Bond Reserve Fund

On or before the last day of each month, the District shall, from the remaining money in
the Revenue Fund, thereafter transfer to the Trustee for deposit (on a parity with the deposits for
the reserve funds for all other Installment Purchase Contracts and Bonds) in the Bond Reserve
Fund that sum, if any, necessary to restore the Reserve Fund to an amount equal to the Reserve
Requirement or to replenish any surety bond issued in lieu thereof.

The Indenture defines Reserve Requirement to be, as of any date of determination, the
least of (a) ten percent (10%) of the initial offering price to the public of the Bonds, or (b) the
maximum annual interest and principal payments on the Bonds payable in the current or any
future one-year period ending on June 1, or (c) one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the
average annual interest and principal payments on the Bonds payable in the current or any future
one-year period ending on June 1, all as computed by the District under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and specified in writing to the Trustee.

No deposit need be made in the Bond Reserve Fund if the amount available and

contained therein is at least equal to the Reserve Requirement.

All money in the Bond Reserve Fund shall be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely
for the purpose of paying the interest on and principal of the Bonds as such interest and principal
becomes due and payable in the event the money in the Bond Redemption Fund is at any time
insufficient for such purpose.

Rate Covenant

The District covenants in the Indenture to fix, prescribe and collect charges, fees and
rates for the use of the Water System which are at least sufficient to yield, during each fiscal
year, Net Revenues equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Debt Service for
such fiscal year, plus the amount necessary to restore the Bond Reserve Fund to the Reserve
Requirement in such fiscal year. The District may make adjustments from time to time in such
charges, fees and rates and may make such classification thereof as it deems necessary, but shall
not reduce the charges, fees and rates then in effect unless the Net Revenues from such reduced
charges, fees and rates will at all times be sufficient to meet the requirement described in the first
sentence above. If for any fiscal year the District does not meet the requirements with respect to

7

the rate covenant, the District will engage an Independent Engineer to recommend revised
charges, fees and rates, and the District will, to the extent practicable and subject to applicable
requirements and restrictions imposed by law and subject to a good faith determination by the
District that such recommendations, in whole or in part, are in the best interests of the District,
implement such revised charges, fees and rates so as to produce the necessary Net Revenues.

Parity Obligations

The Indenture provides that the District will not incur any obligations payable from the
Net Revenues superior to the payment of the Bonds, although the District may at any time
execute any Installment Purchase Contract or issue any water revenue bonds (“Parity Bonds”), as
the case may be, to finance or refinance any Project the Debt Service on which Installment
Purchase Contract or Parity Bonds are payable on a parity with the payment by the District of the
Bonds from the Net Revenues, provided that the following conditions are met:

(a)

The Net Revenues for the most recently audited fiscal year preceding the
date of the adoption by the Board of Directors of the resolution authorizing the execution
of such Installment Purchase Contract or the issuance of such Parity Bonds, as the case
may be (including adjustments to give effect to increases or decreases in charges, fees or
rates for the use of the Water System approved and in effect as of the date of calculation),
calculated (with respect to fees) on the basis of the average annual connection fees,
annexation fees and other one-time fees received by the District during the immediately
preceding three audited fiscal year periods, as evidenced by both a calculation prepared
by the District and a special report prepared by an Independent Certified Public
Accountant on such calculation on file with the District, shall have produced a sum equal
to at least one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Debt Service for such fiscal
year on all then outstanding Installment Purchase Contracts and Parity Bonds; and

(b)

The estimated Net Revenues for the first fiscal year after the latest Date of
Operation of any uncompleted Project (or the period for which interest is capitalized,
whichever is longer), as evidenced by a calculation prepared by an Independent Engineer
on file with the District, plus (after giving effect to the completion of all uncompleted
Projects) an allowance for estimated Revenues for such fiscal year arising from any
increase in the charges, fees or rates estimated to be fixed and prescribed for the use of
the Water System in an amount equal to ninety percent (90%) of the amount by which
such Revenues would have been increased if such increase had been in effect during such
fiscal year (as similarly evidenced), shall produce a sum equal to at least one hundred
twenty-five percent (125%) of the estimated Debt Service for such fiscal year; after
giving effect, in either case, to the execution of all Installment Purchase Contracts and the
issuance of all Parity Bonds estimated to be required to be executed or issued to pay the
costs of completing all uncompleted Projects, assuming that all such Installment Purchase
Contracts and Parity Bonds have maturities, interest rates and proportionate principal
repayment provisions similar to the Installment Purchase Contract last executed or then
being executed or the Parity Bonds last issued or then being issued for the purpose of
acquiring and constructing any of such uncompleted Projects; and

(c)

The Project to be acquired and constructed with the proceeds of such
Installment Purchase Contract or such Parity Bonds, as the case may be, is technically

8

feasible and the estimated cost of the acquisition and construction thereof is reasonable,
and (after giving effect to the completion of all uncompleted Projects) the rates, fees and
charges estimated to be fixed and prescribed for the use of the Water System for such
fiscal year from the fiscal year in which such Installment Purchase Contract is executed
or such Parity Bonds are issued, as the case may be, to and including the first complete
fiscal year after the latest Date of Operation of any uncompleted Project are economically
feasible and reasonably considered necessary based on projected operations for such
period, as evidenced by an Engineer’s Report (prepared at the time of the execution of the
initial Installment Purchase Contract or the issuance of the initial Bonds, as the case may
be, for the purpose of acquiring and constructing the Project) on file with the District;

provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing conditions, any Installment Purchase Contract may
be executed and delivered and any Bonds may be issued without regard to such conditions if the
Debt Service in each fiscal year after the execution and delivery of any such Installment
Purchase Contract or the issuance of any such Bonds, as the case may be, is not increased by
reason of the execution and delivery of such Installment Purchase Contract or the issuance of
such Bonds; and provided further, that notwithstanding the foregoing conditions, no such
Installment Purchase Contract shall be executed and delivered nor such Bonds shall be issued if
an Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be then continuing.

The Bonds, when issued, will be secured by a pledge of Net Revenues on a parity with
the District’s obligation to make the 2003 Installment Payments with respect to the 2003
Certificates.

Eminent Domain Proceeds

The Indenture provides that if all or any part of the Water System is taken by eminent
domain proceedings then, if (1) the District obtains and files with the Trustee an Engineer’s
Report showing (i) the estimated loss of annual Net Revenues, if any, suffered or to be suffered
by the District by reason of such eminent domain proceedings, (ii) a general description of the
additions, betterments, extensions or improvements to the Water System proposed to be acquired
and constructed by the District from such Net Proceeds, and (iii) an estimate of the additional
annual Net Revenues
to be derived from such additions, betterments, extensions or
improvements, and (2) the District, on the basis of such Engineer’s Report, determines that the
estimated additional annual Net Revenues will sufficiently offset the estimated loss of annual
Net Revenues resulting from such eminent domain proceedings so that the ability of the District
to meet
the Indenture will not be substantially impaired (which
determination shall be final and conclusive), then the District shall promptly proceed with the
acquisition and construction of such additions, betterments, extensions or improvements
substantially in accordance with such Engineer’s Report and such Net Proceeds shall be applied
as set forth in a Written Request of the District for the payment of the costs of such acquisition
and construction, and any balance of such Net Proceeds not required by the District for such
purpose shall be deposited in the Revenue Fund.

its obligations under

Insurance

The District covenants in the Indenture to procure and maintain insurance on the Water
System with responsible insurers in such amounts and against such risks (including accident to or

9

destruction of the Water System) as are usually covered in connection with water systems similar
to the Water System so long as such insurance is available from reputable insurance companies.
In the event of any damage to or destruction of the Water System caused by the perils covered by
such insurance, the Net Proceeds thereof shall be applied to the reconstruction, repair or
replacement promptly after such damage or destruction shall occur, and the District shall
continue and properly complete such reconstruction, repair or replacement as expeditiously as
possible, and shall pay out of such Net Proceeds all costs and expenses in connection with such
reconstruction, repair or replacement so that the same shall be completed and the Water System
shall be free and clear of all claims and liens.

The District further covenants in the Indenture to procure and maintain such other
insurance which it shall deem advisable or necessary to protect its interests and the interests of
the Owners, which insurance shall afford protection in such amounts and against such risks as
are usually covered in connection with water systems similar to the Water System; provided, that
any such insurance may be maintained under a self-insurance program so long as such
self-insurance is maintained in the amounts and manner usually maintained in connection with
water systems similar to the Water System.

CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND

APPROPRIATIONS AND CHARGES

Article XIIIB

At the statewide special election of November 6, 1979, the voters approved an initiative
entitled “Limitation of Government Appropriations” which added Article XIIIB to the California
Constitution. Under Article XIIIB, State and local governmental entities have an annual
“appropriations limit” which limits the ability to spend certain monies which are called
“appropriations subject to limitation” (consisting of tax revenues, State subventions and certain
other funds) in an amount higher than the “appropriations.” The “base year” for establishing
such appropriation limit is the 1978-79 Fiscal Year and the limit is to be adjusted annually to
reflect changes in population and consumer prices. Adjustments in the appropriations limit of an
entity may also be made if (i) the financial responsibility for a service is transferred to another
public entity or to a private entity, (ii) the financial source for the provision of services is
transferred from taxes to other revenues, or (iii) the voters of the entity approve a change in the
limit for a period of time not to exceed four years.

Appropriations subject to Article XIIIB generally include proceeds of taxes levied by the
State or other entity of local government, exclusive of certain State subventions and refunds of
taxes. “Proceeds of taxes” include, but are not limited to, all tax revenues and the proceeds to an
entity of government from (i) regulatory licenses, user charges, and user fees (but only to the
extent such proceeds exceed the cost of providing the service or regulation), and (ii) the
investment of tax revenues. Article XIIIB includes a requirement that if an entity’s revenues in
any year exceed the amounts permitted to be spent, the excess would have to be returned by
revising tax rates or fee schedules over the subsequent two years.

Certain expenditures are excluded from the appropriations limit including payments of
indebtedness existing or legally authorized as of January 1, 1979, or of bonded indebtedness
thereafter approved by the voters and payments required to comply with court or federal

10

mandates which without discretion required an expenditure for additional services or which
unavoidably make the providing of existing services more costly.

It is the position of the District that the water fees and charges it imposes for use of the
Water System do not exceed the costs it reasonably bears in providing such services and
therefore are not subject to the limits of Article XIIIB.

Proposition 218

On November 5, 1996, the voters of the State approved Proposition 218, the so-called
“Right to Vote on Taxes Act.” Proposition 218 added Articles XIIIC and XIIID to the State
Constitution, which contain a number of provisions affecting the ability of local governments to
levy and collect both existing and future taxes, assessments, fees and charges.

Article XIIIC. Article XIIIC removes limitations on the initiative power in matters of
local taxes, assessments, fees and charges. In Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency v. Beringson
(“Bighorn”), decided by the California Supreme Court on July 24, 2006, the petitioner sought to
establish his right to reduce a local water agency’s water rates and fees and charges through use
of the initiative power.
In holding for the petitioner on this issue, the court stated that the
absence of a restrictive definition of “fee” or “charge” in Article XIIIC suggests that those terms
include all levies that are ordinarily understood to be fees or charges, including all of the
property-related fees and charges subject to Article XIIID. Though the Supreme Court did not
arrive at an exact definition of such terms, it did determine that fees and charges that are fees and
charges within the meaning of Article XIIID are necessarily fees and charges within the meaning
of Article XIIIC. See “Article XIIID” below. The Court held that Article XIIIC authorizes the
use of the initiative process to reduce water rate and other delivery charges, but that it does not
authorize use of the initiative power to impose a voter-approval requirement on future increases
or new water delivery charges. The court declined to determine whether the initiative power is
limited by other statutory provisions requiring that water service charges be set at a level that
will pay system expenses and debt service since that issue was not before the court.

Consequently, the voters of the District could, by future initiative, seek to repeal or
reduce any local tax, assessment, fee or charge, including the District’s water service fees and
charges, which are the source of Net Revenues pledged to the payment of debt service on the
Bonds. Though the use of the initiative power is arguably limited in the case of levies directly
pledged to bonded indebtedness, such as the fees and charges imposed by the District for
services of the Water System that are pledged to the payment of the Bonds, there can be no
assurance that the voters of the District will not seek to approve an initiative which attempts to
reduce the fees and charges imposed by the Water System securing the Bonds.

Article XIIID. Article XIIID established procedural requirements for imposition of
assessments, which are defined as any charge on real property for a special benefit conferred
upon the real property. Standby charges are classified as assessments. Procedural requirements
include the conducting of a public hearing and an election by mailed ballot, with notice to the
record owner of each parcel subject to the assessment. The assessment may not be imposed if a
majority of the ballots returned oppose the assessment, with each ballot weighted according to
the proportional financial obligation of the affected parcel. The District does not believe that its
connection fees would be classified as standby charges or assessments for the Water System.

11

Article XIIID conditions the imposition or increase of any “fee” or “charge” upon there
being no written majority protest after a required public hearing and voter approval for fees and
charges other than for sewer, water or refuse collection services. Article XIIID defines “fee” or
“charge” to mean levies (other than ad valorem or special taxes or assessments) imposed by a
local government upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of the ownership or tenancy of
real property, including a user fee or charge for a “property-related service.” One of the
requirements of Article XIIID is that before a property related fee or charge may be imposed or
increased, a public hearing upon the proposed fee or charge must be held and mailed notice sent
to the record owner of each identified parcel of land upon which the fee or charge is proposed for
imposition. In the public hearing, if written protests of the proposed fee or charge are presented
by a majority of the owners of affected identified parcel(s), an agency may not impose the fee or
charge.

In Richmond et al. v. Shasta Community Services District (“Richmond”), the California
Supreme Court held that a water connection fee was not a “property-related” fee and charge
subject to Article XIIID. However, in the opinion, the California Supreme Court suggested in
dicta that fees for ongoing water service through an existing connection were “property related”
fees and charges imposed on a person as an incident of property ownership. The court addressed
this issue directly in the Bighorn case discussed above.
In its decision, the court relied on its
discussion in Richmond to reach the conclusion that fees and charges for ongoing water service
through an existing connection are “property-related” fees and charges imposed on a person as
an incident of property ownership for purposes of Article XIIID whether the fees and charges are
calculated based on usage or are imposed as a fixed monthly fee.

The District has complied with the procedures required by Article XIIID in connection
with the increase in the water fees and charges approved by the Board of Directors. See
“DISTRICT AND WATER SYSTEM INFORMATION – Rates and Charges” herein.

In addition to the procedural requirements of Article XIIID, under Article XIIID, all
property related fees and charges, including those which were in existence prior to the passage of
Proposition 218 in November 1996, must meet the following substantive standards:

Revenues derived from the fee or charge cannot exceed the funds required to

provide the property related service.

(1)

(2)

Revenues derived from the fee or charge must not be used for any purpose other

than that for which the fee or charge was imposed.

(3)

The amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident
of property ownership must not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the
parcel.

(4)

No fee or charge may be imposed for a service unless that service is actually used
by, or immediately available to, the owner of the property in question. Fees or charges based on
potential or future use of a service are not permitted. Standby charges, whether characterized as
charges or assessments, must be classified as assessments and cannot be imposed without
compliance with Section 4 of Article XIIID (relating to assessments).

12

(5)

No fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental services including,
but not limited to, police, fire, ambulance or library services where the service is available to the
public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners.

Article XIIID provides that nothing in Proposition 218 shall be construed to affect
existing laws relating to the imposition of fees or charges as a condition of property
development.

Further interpretation and application of Proposition 218 will ultimately be determined by
the courts or through implementing legislation with respect to a number of the matters discussed
above, and it
this time to predict with certainty the outcome of such
determination or the nature or scope of any such legislation.

Future Initiatives

Articles XIIIB, XIIIC and XIIID were adopted as measures that qualified for the ballot
pursuant to California’s initiative process. From time to time other initiatives could be proposed
and adopted affecting the District’s Net Revenues or ability to increase charges or connection
fees.

Effect of Proposition 218 and of Possible General Limitations on Enforcement Remedies

The ability of the District to comply with its covenants under the Indenture and to
generate Net Revenues sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds may be
adversely affected by actions and events outside of the control of the District and may be
adversely affected by actions taken (or not taken) under Article XIIIC or Article XIIID by voters,
property owners, taxpayers or payers of assessments, fees and charges. Furthermore, any
remedies available to the owners of the Bonds upon the occurrence of an event of default under
the Indenture are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions, which are often subject to
discretion and delay and could prove both expensive and time consuming to obtain. In addition
to the possible limitations on the ability of the District to comply with its covenants under the
Indenture, the rights and obligations under the Bonds and the Indenture may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and
other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to
the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to limitations on legal remedies
against municipal utilities in the State.

Based on the foregoing, in the event the District fails to comply with its covenants under
the Indenture, including its covenants to generate sufficient Net Revenues, as a consequence of
the application of Article XIIIC and Article XIIID, or to pay principal of or interest on the
Bonds, there can be no assurance that available remedies will be adequate to fully protect the
interests of the holders of the Bonds.

RISK FACTORS

The following discussion of risks is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the risks
the relative

associated with the purchase of the Bonds and does not necessarily reflect
importance of the various risks.

13

General

The payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds is secured solely by a pledge of the
Net Revenues and certain funds under the Indenture. The realization of the Net Revenues is
subject to, among other things, the capabilities of management of the District, the ability of the
District to provide water services to its users, and the ability of the District to establish and
maintain water fees and charges sufficient to provide the required debt service coverage as well
as pay for Maintenance and Operation Costs.

Among other matters, drought, general and local economic conditions and changes in law
and government regulations (including initiatives and moratoriums on growth) could adversely
affect the amount of Net Revenues realized by the District.

Environmental Regulation

In the event

The kind and degree of water treatment effected through the Water System is regulated,
to a large extent, by the federal government and the State. Treatment standards set forth in
federal and State law control the operations of the Water System and mandate its use of
technology.
the federal government, acting through the Environmental
Protection Agency, or the State, acting through the Department of Health Services, or additional
federal or State legislation, should impose stricter water quality standards upon the Water
System, the District’s expenses could increase accordingly and rates and charges would have to
be increased to offset those expenses. It is not possible to predict the direction federal or State
regulation will take with respect to drinking water quality standards, although it is likely that
both will impose more stringent standards with attendant higher costs.

that

Earthquakes, Floods and Other Natural Disasters

Earthquakes, floods or other natural disasters could interrupt operation of the District’s
Water System and cause increased costs and thereby interrupt the ability of the District to realize
Net Revenues. The District is located in a seismically active region within the vicinity of several
active and inactive faults, including the San Andreas Fault, the Hayward Fault, the Concorde-
Green Valley Fault and the Calaveras Fault. The District could sustain extensive damage to its
Water System in a major earthquake, both from ground motion and possible liquefaction of
underlying soils. In October 1989, an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale and with an
epicenter approximately 50 miles south of the District struck the San Francisco Bay Area. There
was no material structural damage to the District’s facilities. The District is not obligated under
the Indenture to have earthquake or flood insurance. The water facilities are designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practice and all applicable seismic standards.
To date, no such facilities have suffered any damage as a result of seismic activity. Additionally,
the District has prepared an emergency operations plan for the operation of the major local
components of the Water System in the event of a major earthquake. There can be no assurance
that earthquakes or other natural disasters will not interrupt the ability of the Water System to
realize Net Revenues sufficient to pay principal and interest of the Bonds.

14

System Demand

There can be no assurance that the demand for water services will occur as described in
this Official Statement. Reduction in levels of demand could require an increase in rates or
charges in order to comply with the covenants to fix rates and charges.

System Expenses

There can be no assurance that the District’s expenses will be consistent with the
descriptions in this Official Statement. Increases in expenses could require a significant increase
in rates or charges in order to pay for District water projects and comply with the rate covenant.

Rate Process

The passage of Proposition 218 by the California electorate potentially affects the
District’s ability to impose future rate increases, and no assurance can be given that future rate
increases will not encounter majority protest opposition under Proposition 218.
See
“CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND
APPROPRIATIONS AND CHARGES – Articles XIIIC and XIIID of
the California
Constitution.”

Investment of Funds

All moneys in the Revenue Fund may be invested by the District from time to time in any
investments which are legal for investment of District funds under California law. All moneys in
any of the funds or accounts established with the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture will be
invested by the Trustee solely in Permitted Investments. Obligations purchased as an investment
of moneys in any fund shall be deemed to be part of such fund or account.

All interest or gain derived from the investment of amounts in any of the funds or
accounts established under the Indenture will be deposited in the fund or account from which
such investment was made. For purposes of acquiring any investments, the Trustee may
commingle funds held by it pursuant to the Indenture upon the Request of the District. The
Trustee may act as principal or agent in the acquisition of any investment. The Trustee will incur
no liability for losses arising from any investments made in accordance with the Indenture. See
“APPENDIX A – SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE INDENTURE.”

Limitations on Remedies and Bankruptcy

The ability of the District to increase water services charges and to comply with its
covenants under the Indenture and to generate Net Revenues sufficient to pay principal of and
interest on the Bonds may be adversely affected by actions and events outside of the control of
the District and may be adversely affected by actions taken (or not taken) by voters, property
owners, taxpayers or payers of assessments, fees and charges. See “CONSTITUTIONAL AND
STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND APPROPRIATIONS AND CHARGES –
Proposition 218.” Furthermore, any remedies available to the owners of the Bonds upon the
occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture are in many respects dependent upon
judicial actions, which are often subject to discretion and delay and could prove both expensive
and time consuming to obtain.

15

In addition to the limitations on remedies contained in the Indenture, the rights and
obligations under the Bonds and the Indenture may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or
affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial
discretion in appropriate cases and to limitations on legal remedies against cities in the State.
Various legal opinions to be delivered concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds will be so
qualified. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of bond counsel is set forth in
Appendix E hereto.
In the event the District fails to comply with its covenants under the
Indenture or to pay principal of or interest on the Bonds, there can be no assurance that available
remedies will be adequate to fully protect the interests of the holders of the Bonds.

The enforcement of the remedies provided in the Indenture could prove both expensive
and time consuming. In addition, the rights and remedies provided in the Indenture may be
limited by and are subject to provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter
enacted, and to other laws or equitable principles that may affect creditors’ rights. If the District
were to file a petition under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code),
the Bondholders and the Trustee could be prohibited or severely restricted from taking any steps
to enforce their rights under the Indenture.

Secondary Market for Bonds

There can be no guarantee that there will be a secondary market for the Bonds or, if a
secondary market exists, that any Bonds can be sold for any particular price. Occasionally,
because of general market conditions or because of adverse history or economic prospects
connected with a particular issue, secondary marketing practices in connection with a particular
issue are suspended or terminated. Additionally, prices of issues for which a market is being
made will depend upon then-prevailing circumstances. Such prices could be substantially
different from the original purchase price.

Parity Obligations

As described in “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Parity Obligations” above, the
Indenture permits the District to execute Installment Purchase Contracts or issue Parity Bonds,
its obligations under which would be payable on a parity with the payment of debt service of the
Bonds. In the event of a decline in Net Revenues available to pay debt service on the Bonds, the
existence of Installment Purchase Contracts or Parity Bonds could adversely affect the District’s
ability to pay debt service on the Bonds. Currently, the Bonds are secured by Net Revenues on a
parity with the 2003 Installment Payments. See “INTRODUCTION – Sources of Payment for
the Bonds – Parity Obligations” herein.

DISTRICT AND WATER SYSTEM INFORMATION

Background

In 1914, the Alameda County Water District became the first agency formed under the
State’s County Water District Act. The District was formed originally to halt the exportation of
water from the local groundwater basin and to conserve the water of Alameda Creek. Since its
founding,
is responsible for the

groundwater supply underlying the cities of Fremont, Newark and Union City in southern
Alameda County.

Since 1930, the District has also been a water distribution agency. From purchase of a
small distribution system in Alvarado (now a part of Union City), the District has expanded to
serve almost all of the area covered by its conservation activities. The District produces, stores,
treats and distributes water for a population of 333,648 people in southern Alameda County. The
District covers approximately 100 square miles and as of June 2009 had 80,672 customer
accounts. For Fiscal Year 2008-09, average daily demand is approximately 45.3 millions of
gallons per day (“mgd”) and peak demand is approximately 69.0 mgd. Currently, the maximum
production rates of the District’s four water treatment plants are: Mission San Jose Water
Treatment Plant (4.0 mgd),
the Water Treatment Plant Number Two (21 mgd), Newark
Desalination Facility (5 mgd) and Blending Facility (50 mgd) (collectively, the “Treatment
Facilities”).

represented by one labor organization. Operating Engineers Local No. 3 of the AFL-CIO,
represents 134 of the District’s employees in the Finance, Operations, and Engineering
departments. Wages, benefits, and conditions of employment are covered by a memorandum of
understanding with Operating Engineers Local No. 3.

19

Water Supply

The District’s current water production is approximately 51,000 acre-feet per year.
Water is provided from four sources: groundwater from the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin
(including fresh groundwater from two well fields and desalination of brackish groundwater);
surface water from the Del Valle Reservoir; water imported from the State Water Project; and
water imported from the San Francisco Regional Water System. The amount of water available
from these sources is variable in any given year due to hydrologic conditions and other factors.
Assuming wet local conditions and full delivery of imported water supplies, these four sources
provide up to a maximum of approximately 90,000 acre-feet per year.

The District’s contract with the State provides that in the event of a shortage in supply
due to drought, the State will reduce deliveries from the State Water Project (as described below)
to its contractors in proportion to their contractual amounts. See “State Water Project” below for
further details.

The District's contract with the City and County of San Francisco (“San Francisco”)
provides for a division in supply between the wholesale customers, collectively, and San
Francisco, in the event of a shortage of supply in the San Francisco Regional Water System. In
the event of a shortage of up to 20%, the wholesale customers will receive between 62.5% and
64.5% of the total water available, depending on the severity of the shortage. See “San
Francisco Regional Water System” below for further details.

Supply agreements with both the State and San Francisco permit these suppliers to
increase the unit charges for water. The cost of water purchased from the State is determined by
formula based on capital and operating expenses. Water is purchased from San Francisco in
accordance with a wholesale rate schedule as adjusted from time to time by the Public Utilities
Commission of the City and County of San Francisco (the “SFPUC”), in accordance with cost
allocation rules contained in its contract with wholesale customers, such as the District.

San Francisco Regional Water System

The District has a 25-year contract, running through 2034, with San Francisco which
provides up to 15,300 acre feet per year from the San Francisco Regional Water System, which
can be, and has been, reduced at San Francisco’s discretion in times of drought. The supply is
predominantly from the Sierra Nevada/Hetch Hetchy system but also includes treated water
produced by San Francisco from its facilities in the Alameda Creek watershed. The District is
one of 26 wholesale customers that have collectively contracted with San Francisco for about
184 mgd. This water does not require treatment by the District other than the addition of
fluoride.

State Water Project

The majority of the water from the State Water Project (“SWP”) goes into the District’s
distribution system after treatment at the Treatment Facilities. The remainder of the District’s
State allotment goes into Alameda Creek, destined for District recharge facilities. The District
has a contract with the State for a maximum annual amount of 42,000 acre feet (“Table A
amount”). However, not all the SWP planned facilities to provide the full project reliability have
been constructed by the State, so the State is left with reduced delivery capability under certain

20

conditions.
In addition, recent court rulings have resulted in new Delta export pumping
constraints which have further reduced the SWP delivery reliability. As such, the amount the
State will be able to deliver to the District and its other customers in the future depends on
several physical, environmental, and political factors beyond the control of the District.

The District began planning for managing its State Water Project surpluses in 1995.

In
an effort to store wet year surpluses from the District’s allotment of State Water Project water for
dry year use, in 1996 the District entered into a water banking agreement with the Semitropic
Water Storage District. This agreement provided for 50,000 acre-feet of storage capacity at the
Semitropic Groundwater Banking Program.
the District acquired an additional
100,000 acre-feet of additional storage capacity at the Semitropic Groundwater Banking Program
by purchasing a portion of the entitlement owned by the Vidler Water Company, Inc. Under
both of the District’s agreements with Semitropic, farmers in the Semitropic Water Storage
District use surplus water from the District’s State Water Project Table A supplies in lieu of
pumping from Semitropic’s groundwater basin during water surplus years. During dry years, the
District is entitled to draw water previously stored in the Semitropic water “bank.” The
District’s water banking contracts run through 2035. The costs of the District’s participation in
the water banking project are accounted for in the District’s audits under “water purchases.”

In 2001,

Local Runoff

Runoff from the Alameda Creek watershed provides the primary source of recharge to
the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. The Alameda Creek watershed is an area roughly 42 miles
long and 15 miles wide, stretching from about nine miles north of Highway 580 to a line about
12 miles into Santa Clara County. The 633 square-mile watershed is populated by over 200,000
people living in five incorporated cities – Danville (partial), Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton and
San Ramon (partial) – and thousands more living in unincorporated areas.

Average rainfall in the watershed is approximately 20 inches per year. Runoff from
much of the southern region is collected in the Calaveras and San Antonio reservoirs and is part
of the San Francisco Regional Water System. Runoff from much of the southeastern portion is
collected in Del Valle Reservoir, to which the District and Zone 7 Water Agency equally share
water rights. Stored water from Del Valle Reservoir can be delivered through the South Bay
Aqueduct.

A continuous flow record has been kept for Alameda Creek since 1892 at the stream
gauging station located about 1.2 miles above Niles. Average annual flow at this station is about
89,000 acre-feet per year.

Environmental Compliance

The Water System is subject to regulatory requirements imposed by State’s Department
of Public Health (“DPH”). Regulations deal primarily with the quality of drinking water. To
comply with mandated water quality, the District must operate the Water System facilities
according to DHS, Domestic Water Supply Permit No. 02-04-95P-0110001,
issued on
September 19, 1995, and Amendment No. 5 to the permit issued on August 11, 2004. The
permit has no expiration date and may be amended from time to time.

(3) Water revenue was anticipated to be less in Fiscal Year 2008-09 due to a combination of factors including the economic downturn, dry weather
conditions and water conservation efforts. Water revenue is projected to increase by about 2.0% over each of the next two years due to growth in
demand. These lower water use projections were included in the February 1, 2009 water rate increase and were also reflected in the District’s long-
range financial planning model.

(1) Includes the effects of the 85% State take-away of ad-valorem tax revenues for years 2005 and 2006. This table demonstrates historical and projected debt service coverage taking into account the inclusion
of property taxes collected by the District, while also taking into account expenses paid from such taxes. As discussed in “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Net Revenues; Pledge of Net Revenues” above, the
Bonds are secured by a pledge of Net Revenues (defined generally as Revenues less Maintenance and Operation Costs). Property tax receipts are excluded from the definition of Revenues. However, costs
paid from taxes are also excluded from the definition of Maintenance and Operation Costs. Therefore, the presentation of debt service coverage above is consistent with the requirements of the Indenture.

Pension Plan Obligations

Plan Description.

The District contributes to the California Public Employee’s
Retirement System (“CalPERS”), an agent multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan.
CalPERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and
death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. CalPERS acts as a common investment and
administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. Benefit provisions and all
other requirements are established by State statute and District resolution. Copies of CalPERS’
annual financial report may be obtained from their Executive Office at 400 P Street, Sacramento,
California 95814. A separate report for the District’s plan within CalPERS is not available.

Funding Policy. Active plan members are required by State statute to contribute 8% of
their annual covered salary. Effective on January 1, 2009, the District paid 1.5% of the 8%
member contributions for Management, Confidential and Professional employees which
amounted to $69,100. This employer paid member contribution percentage increased from 1.5%
to 2.5% on July 1, 2009. The District was required to contribute for Fiscal Years 2009 and 2008
at an actuarially determined rate of 19.210% and 19.138% of annual covered payroll for the
District’s employees, which amounted to $3,481,100 and $3,209,700 for the years ended June
30, 2009 and 2008.

Annual Pension Cost. For Fiscal Year 2009, the District’s annual pension cost of
$3,481,100 for CalPERS was equal to the District’s required and actual contributions. The
required contribution was determined as part of the June 30, 2007 actuarial valuation using the
entry age normal actuarial cost method. The actuarial assumptions included (a) 7.75%
investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses), (b) projected annual salary increases
ranging from 3.25% to 14.45% and (c) 3.25% per year cost-of-living adjustments. Both (a) and
(b) included an inflation component of 3.0%. The actuarial value of CalPERS assets was
determined using techniques that smooth the effects of short-term volatility in the market value
of investments over a fifteen-year period. CalPERS unfunded actuarial accrued liability (or
surplus) is being amortized as a level percentage of projected payroll on a closed basis. The
average amortization period for current service unfunded liability at June 30, 2007 was 30 years.

Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) Plan. Effective January 1, 1997, the District
established and administered the District 401(a) Plan (the “401(a) Plan”), a defined contribution
plan. The 401(a) Plan provides tax-deferred retirement benefits to District employees. The
employees vest upon joining the 401(a) Plan. The District has agreed to contribute to the
employee’s accounts, up to a specified amount,
to match the employees’ contributions to the
District’s 457(b) Plan, an eligible deferred compensation plan. The District contributed $55,500
and $55,600 to the 401(a) Plan in Fiscal Years 2009 and 2008, respectively, as required under
the District’s Management, Confidential and Professional (“MCP”) employee compensation
schedule. Effective January 1, 2004, the District’s matching calendar year contribution to the
401(a) Plan for non-MCP employees was discontinued, in accordance with the Memorandum of
Understanding for United Public Employees Local 1021, then in effect.

Other Post-Employment Benefits

Retiree Health Insurance. The District provides health plan coverage under the
CalPERS Health Benefits Program (“PEMHCA”) for eligible retirees and eligible dependents, or
surviving spouse or registered domestic partner. To fund this coverage, the District contributes
the minimum required amounts under the PEMHCA rules as determined by CalPERS on an
annual basis.

Longevity Payments for Employees Hired Before August 1, 2002. The District shall
make a longevity payment on a monthly basis into a Retiree Health Care Trust (the “Retiree
HRA Trust”) for employees hired before August 1, 2002, who retire from the District and
receive District-provided retiree coverage under PEMHCA. The District’s longevity payment
into a retiree’s Retiree HRA Trust shall be equal to:
the difference between the minimum
employer contribution (the “MEC”) under PEMHCA and the greater of:
the full cost of
enrollment of the retiree and his/her family members (if applicable) in the highest cost HMO
medical plan with a traditional network or PERS Choice plan offered under PEMHCA (“PPO
Plan”) in the Bay Area/Sacramento Region. If the retiree and/or surviving spouse or registered
domestic partner are age 65 and/or entitled to Medicare, the District’s longevity payment shall be
equal to the greater of: the difference between the MEC and the full cost of enrollment, of the
retiree and eligible dependents, or the surviving spouse or surviving registered domestic partner
in the highest cost Medicare HMO medical plan with a traditional network (“Medicare HMO”)
or PPO Plan.

The District’s longevity payment into a retiree’s Retiree HRA Trust Account shall remain
unchanged for the duration of the retiree’s life and that of their eligible surviving spouse or
surviving registered domestic partner. The District shall cease to make contributions into a
retiree’s Retiree HRA Trust Account upon the retiree’s death if the retiree does not have a
surviving spouse or registered domestic partner, or upon the surviving spouse or registered
domestic partner’s death if these should succeed the retiree.

Longevity Payment for Employees Hired On or After August 1, 2002. The District shall
make a longevity payment on a monthly basis into the Retiree HRA Trust for employees hired on
or after August 1, 2002, who retire from the District and receive District-provided retiree

31

coverage under PEMHCA. The District’s longevity payment for these employees shall be based
on the employee’s completed years of credited service with the District and CalPERS as
described below.

The District’s longevity payment shall be a percentage of the premium cost of coverage
calculated based on the years of service of an employee with the District and CalPERS The
premium cost shall either be equal to the MEC or to:
the difference between the MEC and the
full cost of enrollment of the retiree and his/her family members (if applicable), or surviving
spouse or registered domestic partner in the greater of: the highest cost HMO medical plan with a
traditional network or the PPO Plan in the Bay Area/Sacramento Region. If the retiree and/or
surviving spouse or registered domestic partner are age 65 and/or entitled to Medicare, the
District’s longevity payment shall be based on the years of service of the employee with the

Retiree Dental and Vision Insurance. Retired MCP employees and their eligible
dependents will be provided with dental insurance and vision care insurance. Employees hired on
or after August 1, 2002, must have 15 years of service with the District and be minimum age 50
at retirement in order to receive this retiree dental and vision benefit.

Retired union employees hired after April 1, 1984, must have at least ten years of service
with the District and be minimum age 50 at retirement in order to receive this retiree dental and
vision benefit. Union employees hired after April 1, 1988, must have 15 years of service with the

33

District and be minimum age 50 at retirement in order to receive this retiree dental and vision
benefit.

Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, shall not be eligible to participate in the

District’s retiree vision or dental plan upon their retirement from the District.

Retiree Life Insurance. Upon retirement, at whatever age, the then current Group Life
Insurance Plan will be reduced to a flat $4,000 benefit for MCP retirees and $2,000 for union
retirees. The benefit will not terminate until the claim is incurred. The District will pay the full
cost of the Retiree Life Insurance Employees hired on or after April 1, 2009, shall not be eligible
for retiree life insurance.

Survivor Benefits. The District provides health care benefits as described above for the
surviving spouse and eligible dependents of a retiree so long as they meet the eligibility
requirements. A total of 164 and 164 retirees participated in the plan as of June 30, 2009 and
2008, respectively.

General OPEB Costs. The cost of post-employment health care and life benefits is
recognized as claims are paid. For the years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, expenses of
approximately $1,545,300 and $1,447,300, respectively, were recognized for post-employment
health care and life insurance benefits.

Funding of Other Post-Employment Benefit Obligations. Governmental Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 45 (“GASB 45”) is effective for the District’s fiscal year ending
June 30, 2009. It requires that non-pension, post-employment benefits for retirees, such as post-
retirement health care benefits, be shown as an accrued actuarial liability in the audit, similar to
the current treatment of pension benefits. GASB 45 requires only the identification and
disclosure of the District’s unfunded accrued actuarial liability (“UAAL”) and funding status; it
does not require the District or any other affected public agency to fully fund such liability. The
District has undertaken an actuarial study to estimate its other post-employment benefit
obligations (“OPEB Obligations”) as of June 30, 2007. Such study, updated through April 2009
for new assumptions, changes in discount rates and health benefits, indicates that the District has
a current UAAL of approximately $33.2 million.
In March 2009, the District adopted a self-
administered OPEB Trust Account to fund its OPEB Obligations. In June 2009, the District pre-
funded $3,496,000 of its UAAL into this Trust Account. This amount is net of the District’s
fiscal year 2008-09 retiree other post-employment benefit payments of $1,504,000 and exceeds
the annual required contribution (“ARC”) of $2,592,000. The District intends to annually fund
the full ARC to minimize its OPEB Obligation costs which precludes the recognition of any
liability on the District’s financial statements as provided under GASB 45. The District has also
taken steps to further reduce its overall OPEB Obligations in the future. Employees hired after
January 1, 2009 will receive credit for other post-employment benefits based on a different
formula for years of service and a lower premium contribution benchmark. In addition, the
District intends to transfer its accumulated OPEB assets into a third party retiree benefit trust
account with higher earning potential once the market outlook begins to improve.

TAX MATTERS

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the District, based
upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among
other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants,
interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under
Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and interest on the Bonds is
exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is also of the opinion that
interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or
corporate alternative minimum taxes, although Bond Counsel observes that such interest is
included in adjusted current earnings in calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable
income. Bond Counsel expects to deliver an opinion at the time of issuance of the Bonds
substantially in the form set forth in Appendix E hereto.

To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the Bonds is less than the amount to be
paid at maturity of such Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least
annually over the term of such Bonds), the difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the
accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each Beneficial Owner thereof, is treated as
interest on the Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and
State of California personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular
maturity of the Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the
Bonds is sold to the public (excluding bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). The original issue
discount with respect to any maturity of the Bonds accrues daily over the term to maturity of
such Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with straight-line
interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to the
adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon disposition (including sale,
redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Bonds. Beneficial Owners of the Bonds should
consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Bonds with
original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do not purchase such Bonds in
the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such Bonds is
sold to the public.

Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than
their principal amount payable at maturity (or,
their earlier call date)
(“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is
allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the
interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. However, the
amount of tax-exempt interest received, and a purchaser’s basis in a Premium Bond, will be
reduced by the amount of amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such purchaser.
Beneficial Owners of Premium Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the
proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their particular circumstances.

in some cases, at

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the
exclusion from gross income for federal tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the
Bonds. The District has made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain
restrictions designed to ensure that interest on the Bonds will not be included in federal gross

35

income.
Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may
result in interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes,
possibly from the date of issuance of the Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the
accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not
undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken) or
events occurring (or not occurring) after the date of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect
the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond
Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with such other actions,
events or matters.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from
gross income for federal income tax purposes and that the interest on the Bonds is exempt from
State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or
receipt of interest on, the Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal or state tax
liability. The nature and extent of these other tax consequences will depend upon the particular
tax status of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction.
Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Future legislation, if enacted into law, or clarification of the Code or court decisions may
cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation, or
otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of
such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such future legislation or clarification of the
Code or court decisions may also affect the market price for, or marketability of, the Bonds.
Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending
or proposed federal tax legislation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters
not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the
proper treatment of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not
given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of the District, or about the effect of
future changes in the Code,
the interpretation thereof or the
enforcement thereof by the IRS.
the District has covenanted, however, to comply with the
requirements of the Code.

the applicable regulations,

The IRS has an ongoing program of auditing tax-exempt obligations to determine
whether, in the view of the IRS, interest on such tax-exempt obligations is includable in the gross
income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. Bond Counsel’s engagement with
respect to the Bonds ends with the execution and delivery of the Bonds, and, unless separately
engaged, Bond Counsel
is not obligated to defend the District or the Beneficial Owners
regarding the tax-exempt status of the Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS.
Under current procedures, parties other than the District and their appointed counsel, including
the Beneficial Owners, would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination
process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in connection with an audit examination
of tax-exempt bonds is difficult, obtaining an independent review of IRS positions with which
the District legitimately disagrees, may not be practicable. Any action of the IRS, including but
not limited to selection of the Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or an audit of

36

bonds or certificates of participation presenting similar tax issues may affect the market price for,
or the marketability of, the Bonds, and may cause the District or the Beneficial Owners to incur
significant expense.

CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS

The validity of the Bonds and certain other legal matters are subject to the approving
opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the District. A complete copy
of the proposed form of Bond Counsel opinion is contained in Appendix E hereto. Bond
Counsel undertakes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official
Statement. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the District by Hanson Bridgett LLP.
Payment of the fees and expenses of Bond Counsel is contingent upon issuance of the Bonds.

LITIGATION

To the best knowledge of District Counsel, there is no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation at law or in equity before or by any court, public board or body, pending with
respect to which the District has been served with process or threatened against or affecting the
District, which would adversely impact
the District’s ability to complete the transaction
described in or contemplated by the Indenture or this Official Statement, to restrain or enjoin its
collection of the Revenues of the District or any payments under the Indenture, or in any way
contesting or affecting the validity of the Bonds, the Indenture or the transactions described in
this Official Statement.

RATINGS

Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s, a Division of the
McGraw-Hill Companies (“S&P”), have assigned their municipal bond rating of “Aa3” and
“AAA”, respectively, to the Bonds.

The ratings issued reflect only the view of such rating agencies, and any explanation of
the significance of such ratings should be obtained from such rating agencies. There is no
assurance that such ratings will be retained for any given period of time or that they will not be
revised downward or withdrawn entirely by such rating agencies if, in the judgment of such
rating agencies, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of any
ratings obtained may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds.

UNDERWRITING

The Bonds are being purchased by Stone & Youngberg LLC (the “Underwriter”). The
Underwriter has agreed to purchase the Bonds at a price of $27,485,484.25 (which price is equal
to the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds, plus an original issue premium of $1,250,844.25,
less an Underwriter’s discount of $105,360.00). The Bond Purchase Contract pursuant to which
the Underwriter has agreed to purchase the Bonds provides that the Underwriter will purchase all
of the Bonds if any are purchased, the obligation to make such purchase being subject to certain
terms and conditions set forth in the Bond Purchase Contract, including the approval of certain
legal matters by counsel and certain other conditions.

37

The Underwriter intends to offer the Bonds to the public at the offering prices set forth on
the cover page of this Official Statement. The Underwriter may offer and sell to certain dealers
and others at a price lower than the offering prices stated on the cover page hereof. The offering
price may be changed from time to time by the Underwriter.

VERIFICATION OF MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY

independent accountants, upon
issuance of
the Bonds, will deliver a report on the mathematical accuracy of certain
computations, contained in schedules provided to them which were prepared by the District,
relating to the sufficiency of the anticipated receipts from the Escrow Securities to pay, when
due, the principal, whether at maturity or upon prior prepayment, interest and prepayment
premium requirements with respect to the Prior Bonds.

The report of Causey, Demgen & Moore Inc. will include the statement that the scope of
its engagement is limited to verifying the mathematical accuracy of the computations contained

events occurring, or data or information coming to its attention, subsequent to the date of its
report.

purpose while any of the 2009 Bonds remain unpaid; provided, that out of the Net Revenues

Indenture. This pledge shall constitute a first and exclusive lien on the Net Revenues for the
payment of the 2009 Bonds and all other Installment Purchase Contracts and Bonds in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and thereof.

Allocation of Net Revenues

In order to carry out and effectuate the pledge and lien contained in the Indenture,

and Operation Costs the payment of which is not then immediately required) from the Revenue
Fund as they become due and payable, and the District shall deposit from the remaining money
in the Revenue Fund the following amounts at the following times in the following respective
special funds (each of which is established and each of which the District agrees and covenants

Bond Redemption Fund a sum equal to the amount of interest becoming due under the
Indenture on the next succeeding June 1 or December 1, as the case may be, and on or
before the fifth Business Day before June 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2010, the
District shall, from money in the Revenue Fund, transfer to the Trustee (on a parity with

solely for the purpose of paying the interest on and principal of the 2009 Bonds as such
interest and principal becomes due and payable in the event the money in the Bond
Redemption Fund is at any time insufficient for such purpose.

foregoing deposits have been made, may be withdrawn from the Revenue Fund and deposited by
the District in such fund as it may determine for expenditure for any lawful purpose of the
District.

respect to the Net Revenues or the operation of the Water System. Any real or personal property
which has become nonoperative or which is not needed for the efficient and proper operation of

Revenue Fund.

Against Competitive Facilities

or operate and will not, to the extent permitted by law and within the scope of its powers, permit

conclusively rely on such opinion in complying with the requirements of this section, and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Indenture,
the agreements and
covenants thereunder shall be deemed to be modified to that extent.

or supplies which, if unpaid, might become a lien on the Net Revenues or any part thereof or on
any funds in the hands of the District prior to or superior to the lien of the 2009 Bonds or which
might impair the security of the 2009 Bonds; provided, that nothing contained in the Indenture
shall require the District to make any such payments so long as the District in good faith shall
contest the validity of any such claims.

event of any damage to or destruction of the Water System caused by the perils covered by such
insurance, the Net Proceeds thereof shall be applied to the reconstruction, repair or replacement
promptly after such damage or destruction shall occur, and the District shall continue and
properly complete such reconstruction, repair or replacement as expeditiously as possible, and
shall pay out of such Net Proceeds all costs and expenses in connection with such reconstruction,
repair or replacement so that the same shall be completed and the Water System shall be free and
clear of all claims and liens.

The District will procure and maintain such other insurance which it shall deem
advisable or necessary to protect its interests and the interests of the Owners, which insurance
shall afford protection in such amounts and against such risks as are usually covered in
connection with water systems similar to the Water System; provided, that any such insurance

comply with any regulations or requirements so long as the validity or application thereof shall
be contested in good faith.

Amount of Charges, Fees and Rates

The District will fix, prescribe and collect charges, fees and rates for the use of
the Water System which will be at least sufficient to yield, during each Fiscal Year, Net
Revenues equal to 125% of the Debt Service for such Fiscal Year, plus the amount necessary to
restore the Bond Reserve Fund to the Reserve Requirement in such Fiscal Year as provided in
the Indenture. The District may make adjustments from time to time in such charges, fees and
rates and may make such classification thereof as it deems necessary, but shall not reduce the
charges, fees and rates then in effect unless the Net Revenues from such reduced charges, fees
and rates will at all times be sufficient to meet the requirements of this section. If for any Fiscal
Year the District does not meet the requirements with respect to the rate covenant, the District
will engage an Independent Engineer to recommend revised charges, fees and rates, and the
District will, to the extent practicable and subject to applicable requirements and restrictions
imposed by law and subject

District by reason of such eminent domain proceedings, (ii) a general description of the
additions, betterments, extensions or improvements to the Water System proposed to be acquired
and constructed by the District from such Net Proceeds, and (iii) an estimate of the additional
annual Net Revenues
to be derived from such additions, betterments, extensions or
improvements, and (2) the District, on the basis of such Engineer’s Report, determines that the
estimated additional annual Net Revenues will sufficiently offset the estimated loss of annual
Net Revenues resulting from such eminent domain proceedings so that the ability of the District
to meet
the Indenture will not be substantially impaired (which
determination shall be final and conclusive), then the District shall promptly proceed with the
acquisition and construction of such additions, betterments, extensions or improvements
substantially in accordance with such Engineer’s Report and such Net Proceeds shall be applied
as set forth in a Written Request of the District for the payment of the costs of such acquisition
and construction, and any balance of such Net Proceeds not required by the District for such
purpose shall be deposited in the Revenue Fund.

its obligations under

Additional Installment Purchase Contracts and Bonds

superior to the payment of the 2009 Bonds, although the District may at any time execute any
Installment Purchase Contract or issue any Bonds, as the case may be, to finance or refinance
any Project the Debt Service on which Installment Purchase Contract or Bonds is payable on a
parity with the payment by the District of the 2009 Bonds from the Net Revenues, if:

(a)

The Net Revenues for the most recently audited Fiscal Year preceding the
date of the adoption by the Board of Directors of the resolution authorizing the execution
of such Installment Purchase Contract or the issuance of such Bonds, as the case may be
(including adjustments to give effect to increases or decreases in charges, fees or rates for
the use of the Water System approved and in effect as of the date of calculation),
calculated (with respect to fees) on the basis of the average annual connection fees,
annexation fees and other one-time fees received by the District during the immediately
preceding three (3) audited Fiscal Year period, as evidenced by both a calculation
prepared by the District and a special report prepared by an Independent Certified Public
Accountant on such calculation on file with the District, shall have produced a sum equal
to at least 125% of the Debt Service for such Fiscal Year on all then outstanding
Installment Purchase Contracts and Bonds; and

(b)

The estimated Net Revenues for the first Fiscal Year after the latest Date
of Operation of any uncompleted Project (or the period for which interest is capitalized,
whichever is longer), as evidenced by a calculation prepared by an Independent Engineer
on file with the District, plus (after giving effect to the completion of all uncompleted
Projects) an allowance for estimated Revenues for such Fiscal Year arising from any
increase in the charges, fees or rates estimated to be fixed and prescribed for the use of

A-14

the Water System in an amount equal to 90% of the amount by which such Revenues
would have been increased if such increase had been in effect during such Fiscal Year (as
similarly evidenced), shall produce a sum equal to at least 125% of the estimated Debt
Service for such Fiscal Year; after giving effect, in either case, to the execution of all
Installment Purchase Contracts and the issuance of all Bonds estimated to be required to
be executed or issued to pay the costs of completing all uncompleted Projects, assuming
that all such Installment Purchase Contracts and Bonds have maturities, interest rates and
proportionate principal repayment provisions similar to the Installment Purchase Contract
last executed or then being executed or the Bonds last issued or then being issued for the
purpose of acquiring and constructing any of such uncompleted Projects; and

(c)

The Project to be acquired and constructed with the proceeds of such
Installment Purchase Contract or such Bonds, as the case may be, is technically feasible
and the estimated cost of the acquisition and construction thereof is reasonable, and (after
giving effect to the completion of all uncompleted Projects) the rates, fees and charges
estimated to be fixed and prescribed for the use of the Water System for such Fiscal Year
from the Fiscal Year in which such Installment Purchase Contract is executed or such
Bonds are issued, as the case may be, to and including the first complete Fiscal Year after
the latest Date of Operation of any uncompleted Project are economically feasible and
reasonably considered necessary based on projected operations for such period, as
evidenced by an Engineer’s Report (prepared at the time of the execution of the initial
Installment Purchase Contract or the issuance of the initial Bonds, as the case may be, for
the purpose of acquiring and constructing the Project) on file with the District;

provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing conditions, any Installment Purchase Contract may
be executed and delivered and any Bonds may be issued without regard to such conditions if the
Debt Service in each Fiscal Year after the execution and delivery of any such Installment
Purchase Contract or the issuance of any such Bonds, as the case may be, is not increased by
reason of the execution and delivery of such Installment Purchase Contract or the issuance of
such Bonds; and provided further, that notwithstanding the foregoing conditions, no such
Installment Purchase Contract shall be executed and delivered nor such Bonds shall be issued if
an Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be then continuing.

Further Assurances

The District will adopt, deliver, execute and make any and all further assurances,
instruments and resolutions as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out the intention

shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.

Except during the continuance of an Event of Default,

(a)

the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and obligations and only
such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in the Indenture, and no implied
duties or obligations shall be read therein against the Trustee; and

(b)

in the absence of negligence or willful misconduct on its part, the Trustee
may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions
expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming
to the requirements of the Indenture.

In case an Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the Trustee shall
exercise such rights vested in it under the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in
their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of
his own affairs.

The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use by the District of any money
which the Trustee releases to the District or which the District otherwise receives, or to verify
compliance by the District with the provisions of the Indenture. The Trustee shall not have any
obligation to incur any financial or other liability or risk in performing any duty or obligation or
in exercising any right or remedy thereunder. The Trustee shall be entitled to interest on all
amounts advanced by it under the Indenture at the maximum interest rate permitted by law. The
Trustee in its individual or other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of the 2009 Bonds
with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee.

A-17

The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Event of Default
(other than a payment default under the Indenture) until an officer of the Trustee at its Principal
Corporate Trust Office has been notified by the District in writing that such an Event of Default
has occurred. The Trustee shall not be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or
observance by any other party of any of the agreements, conditions, covenants or terms of the
Indenture or of any of the documents executed in connection with the 2009 Bonds.

The Trustee shall not have any duty to review any financial statement filed with it

by the District.

Before taking action under the Indenture relating to Events of Default and
remedies of Owners or upon the direction of the Owners, the Trustee may require that indemnity
satisfactory to it be furnished to it to protect it against all fees and expenses, including those of
its attorneys and advisors, and protect it against all liability it may incur.

Notice to Trustee

The Trustee shall be protected in acting upon any bond, certificate, consent,
indenture, notice, order, report, request, requisition or other paper or document believed by it to
be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Trustee may
consult with counsel, who may be counsel to the District, with regard to legal questions, and the
opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any
action taken or suffered under the Indenture in good faith and in accordance therewith.

The Trustee shall not be bound to recognize any person as the Owner of a 2009
Bond unless and until such 2009 Bond is submitted for inspection, if required, and his title
thereto satisfactorily established, if disputed.

Whenever in the administration of its duties and obligations under the Indenture
the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to
taking or suffering any action thereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof
be therein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be
deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a Certificate of the District, and such
certificate shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken or suffered under the
provisions thereof upon the faith thereof, but in its discretion the Trustee may, in lieu thereof,
accept other evidence of such matter or may require such additional evidence as to it may seem
reasonable.

Procedure for Amendment of or Supplement to the Indenture

The Indenture and the rights and obligations of the District and of the Owners
may be amended or supplemented at any time by a Supplemental Indenture which shall become
binding when the written consents of the Owners of at least 60% in aggregate principal amount
of the 2009 Bonds then Outstanding (exclusive of 2009 Bonds disqualified as provided in the
Indenture) are filed with the Trustee; provided, that no such amendment or supplement shall
(1) extend the maturity of any 2009 Bond, or reduce the interest rate thereon, or otherwise alter
or impair the obligation of the District to pay the interest thereon or the principal thereof or any
redemption premium thereon or to pay any sinking fund account payment therefor at the time

A-18

and place and at the rate and in the currency and from the funds provided in the Indenture
without the express written consent of the Owner of such 2009 Bond, or (2) permit the creation
by the District of any mortgage, pledge or lien upon the Net Revenues and the other funds
provided in the Indenture superior to or on a parity with the pledge and lien created therein for
the benefit of the 2009 Bonds and the Installment Purchase Contracts and all other Bonds, or
(3) reduce the percentage of 2009 Bonds required for the written consent to any amendment of
the Indenture or supplement thereto, or (4) modify any rights or obligations of the Trustee
without its prior written assent thereto.

The Indenture and the rights and obligations of the District and of the Owners
may also be amended or supplemented at any time by a Supplemental Indenture which shall
become binding upon execution, without the consent of any Owners, but only to the extent
permitted by law and only for any one or more of the following purposes:

(a)

To add to the agreements and covenants of the District contained in the
Indenture other agreements and covenants thereafter to be observed, or to surrender any
right or remedy therein reserved to or conferred upon the District;

(b)

To make such provisions for the purpose of curing any ambiguity
contained in the Indenture or of curing, correcting or supplementing any defective
provision contained therein or in regard to questions arising thereunder as the District
may deem necessary or desirable and not
therewith, which shall not
materially adversely affect the interests of the Owners;

inconsistent

(c)

To provide for the issuance of any additional Bonds and to provide the
terms and conditions under which such additional Bonds may be issued, subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture;

(d)

To amend or supplement the Indenture in such manner as to permit the
qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or any
similar federal statute hereafter in effect, and to add such other agreements, conditions,
covenants and terms as may be permitted by said act or any similar federal statute, which
shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the Owners of the 2009 Bonds;

(e)

To maintain the exclusion under the Code of interest on the 2009 Bonds
from gross income for federal income tax purposes or the exemption of such interest from
State of California personal income taxes;

(f)

To the extent necessary to obtain a municipal bond insurance policy or to
maintain any then existing rating on the 2009 Bonds or to satisfy all or a portion of the
Reserve Requirement by crediting a policy of insurance, a surety bond or a letter of credit
or other comparable credit facility to the Bond Reserve Fund;

(g)

interests of the Owners.

For any other purpose that does not materially adversely affect

the

The Trustee may conclusively rely upon and accept an Opinion of Counsel that an

amendment of the Indenture is in conformity with the provisions of this article.

A-19

Amendment by Mutual Consent

The provisions of this article shall not prevent any Owner from accepting any
amendment as to the particular 2009 Bonds held by such Owner, provided that due notation
thereof is made on such 2009 Bonds.

Events of Default and Remedies

If one or more of the following events shall happen, that is to say:

(a)

If default shall be made in the due and punctual payment of the interest on

any 2009 Bond when and as the same shall become due and payable;

(b)

If default shall be made in the due and punctual payment of the principal
of or the redemption premium, if any, on any 2009 Bond when and as the same shall become due
and payable, whether at maturity as therein expressed, by declaration or otherwise;

(c)

If default shall be made by the District in the observance or performance
of any of the other agreements, conditions, covenants or terms on its part contained in the
Indenture or in the 2009 Bonds, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days
after the District shall have been given notice in writing of such default by the Trustee; provided,
that such default shall not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture if the District shall
commence to cure such default within such 30-day period and thereafter diligently and in good
faith shall proceed to cure such default within a reasonable period of time; or

(d)

If the District shall file a petition or answer seeking reorganization or
arrangement under the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law of the United States
of America or the State of California, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall approve a
petition, filed with or without the consent of the District, seeking reorganization under the federal
bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law of the United States of America or the State of
California, or if, under the provisions of any other law for the relief or aid of debtors, any court
of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control of the District or of the whole or any
substantial part of its property;

then, and in each and every such case during the continuance of such Event of Default, the
Trustee may, and upon the written request of the Owners of not less than 25% in aggregate
principal amount of the 2009 Bonds at the time Outstanding shall, by notice in writing to the
District, declare the principal of all of the 2009 Bonds then Outstanding and the interest accrued
thereon to be immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration the same shall
become due and payable, anything contained in the Indenture or in the 2009 Bonds to the
contrary notwithstanding; provided, that if at any time after the principal of the 2009 Bonds shall
have been so declared due and payable and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the
money due thereunder shall have been obtained or entered, the District shall deposit with the
Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all principal on the 2009 Bonds matured prior to such declaration
and all matured installments of interest (if any) upon all the 2009 Bonds, with interest at the rate
of 12% per annum on such overdue installments of interest and principal, and all expenses of the
Trustee, including attorneys’ fees, together with interest on any amounts advanced as provided in
the Indenture, and any and all other defaults known to the Trustee (other than in the payment of

A-20

interest and principal on the 2009 Bonds due and payable solely by reason of such declaration)
shall have been made good or cured to the satisfaction of the Trustee (or provision deemed by
the Trustee to be adequate shall have been made therefor), then, and in every such case, the
Owners of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 2009 Bonds then Outstanding,
by written notice to the District and to the Trustee, may (on behalf of the Owners of all the 2009
Bonds) rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences; except that no such rescission
or annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or shall impair or exhaust any
right consequent thereon.

Application of Funds Upon Acceleration

All money in the funds provided in the Indenture (except the Rebate Fund) upon
the date of the declaration of acceleration by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture, and all Net
Revenues thereafter available to the District under the Indenture, shall be transmitted to the
Trustee and shall be applied by the Trustee in the following order:

First, to the payment of the costs, fees and expenses of the Trustee, if any, in
carrying out the provisions of the Indenture, including reasonable compensation to its agents,
attorneys and counsel, and thereafter to the payment of the costs and expenses of the Owners in
providing for the declaration of such Event of Default, including reasonable compensation to
their agents, attorneys and counsel;

Second, upon presentation of the several 2009 Bonds, and the stamping thereon of
the amount of the payment if only partially paid or upon the surrender thereof if fully paid, to the
payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon the 2009 Bonds for interest and
principal, with interest on the overdue interest and principal at the rate of 12% per annum, and in
case such money shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so owing and unpaid upon
the 2009 Bonds, then to the payment of such interest, principal and interest on overdue interest
and principal without preference or priority among such interest, principal and interest on
overdue interest and principal, ratably to the aggregate of such interest, principal and interest on
overdue interest and principal.

Other Remedies of Owners

Any Owner shall have the right for the equal benefit and protection of all Owners

similarly situated:

(a)

By mandamus or other suit or proceeding at law or in equity to enforce his
rights against the District and any of the officers and employees of the District, and to compel the
District or any such officers or employees to perform and carry out their duties under the Law
and their agreements and covenants with the Owners as provided herein;

(b)

By suit in equity to enjoin any acts or things which are unlawful or violate

the rights of the Owners; or

(c)

Upon the happening of an Event of Default, by a suit in equity to require
the District and its officers and employees to account for the Net Revenues as the trustee of an
express trust.

A-21

Remedies Not Exclusive

No remedy conferred upon or reserved to the Owners is intended to be exclusive
of any other remedy, and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
other remedy given under the Indenture or existing, at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise,
and may be exercised without exhausting and without regard to any other remedy conferred by
the Law or any other law.

Discharge of 2009 Bonds

If the District shall pay or cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid, to the
Owners of all Outstanding 2009 Bonds the interest thereon and the principal thereof and the
redemption premiums, if any, thereon at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and in the
Indenture, then the Owners of such 2009 Bonds shall cease to be entitled to the pledge of Net
Revenues and the other funds provided in the Indenture, and all agreements, covenants and other
obligations of the District to the Owners of such 2009 Bonds thereunder shall thereupon cease,
terminate and become void and be discharged and satisfied.

Any Outstanding 2009 Bonds shall prior to the scheduled maturity dates thereof
be deemed to have been paid within the meaning of and with the effect expressed in the first
paragraph of this section (except that the District shall remain liable for the payment of such
2009 Bonds, but only from the money deposited with the Trustee as provided in the Indenture) if
there shall have been deposited with the Trustee money to be held in trust by the Trustee
sufficient for such payment at the maturity dates thereof or the redemption dates thereof.

Any Outstanding 2009 Bonds shall prior to the scheduled maturity dates thereof
be deemed to have been paid within the meaning of and with the effect expressed in the first
paragraph of this section (except that the District shall remain liable for the payment of such
2009 Bonds, but only from the money or Federal Securities deposited with the Trustee as
provided by the Indenture) if (1) there shall have been deposited with the Trustee either money in
an amount which shall be sufficient or Federal Securities which are not subject to redemption
prior to maturity (including any Federal Securities issued or held in book-entry form on the
books of the Department of Treasury of the United States of America) the interest on and the
principal of which when paid will provide money which, together with the money, if any,
deposited with the Trustee at the same time, shall be sufficient (as evidenced by a report of an
Independent Certified Public Accountant obtained by the District and filed with the Trustee) to
pay when due the interest to become due on such 2009 Bonds on and prior to the maturity dates
thereof or the redemption dates thereof and the principal of and the redemption premiums, if any,
on such 2009 Bonds on the maturity dates thereof or the redemption dates thereof, and (2) the
District shall have given the Trustee (in form satisfactory to the Trustee) irrevocable instructions
to mail, as soon as practicable, a notice to the Owners of such Bonds that the deposit required by
clause (1) of this paragraph has been made with the Trustee and that such 2009 Bonds are
deemed to have been paid in accordance with this section, and stating the maturity dates thereof
or the redemption dates thereof upon which money is to be available for the payment of the
principal of and the redemption premiums, if any, on such 2009 Bonds; provided, that no Federal
Securities or money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to this section (nor any interest on or
principal payments of such Federal Securities) shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other

A-22

than, and such Federal Securities and money shall be held in trust for, the payment of the interest
on and the principal of and the redemption premiums, if any, on such 2009 Bonds as provided
therein, except that any money received from such interest on or principal payments of such
Federal Securities deposited with the Trustee which is not then needed for the foregoing purpose
shall, to the extent practicable, be reinvested as specified in a Written Request of the District
filed with the Trustee in Federal Securities maturing at the times and in the amounts sufficient to
pay when due the interest on and the principal of and the redemption premiums, if any, on such
2009 Bonds on and prior to such maturity dates thereof or redemption dates thereof, and all
interest earned from such reinvestments shall be deposited in the Revenue Fund.

After the payment of the interest and principal and redemption premiums, if any,
on all Outstanding 2009 Bonds as provided in this section, the Trustee shall (after the Payment of
all amounts due to it under the Indenture) execute and deliver to the District all such instruments
as may be necessary or desirable to evidence the discharge and satisfaction of the Indenture, and
the Trustee shall pay over or deliver to the District all money or deposits or investments held by
it pursuant thereto which are not required for the payment of the interest and principal and
redemption premiums, if any on the 2009 Bonds.

Unclaimed Money

Any money held by the Trustee in trust for the payment and discharge of the
interest on or the principal of or the redemption premiums, if any, on any of the 2009 Bonds
which remains unclaimed for two years after the date when such payments have become due and
payable, if such money was held by the Trustee at such date, or for two years after the date of
deposit of such money if deposited with the Trustee after the date when such payments became
due and payable, shall be repaid by the Trustee to the District as its absolute property and free
from trust, and the Trustee shall thereupon be released and discharged with respect thereto and
the Owners shall look only to the District for the making of such payments; provided, that before
being required to make any such payment to the District, the Trustee shall mail by first class mail
to the Owners of such 2009 Bonds (at the expense of the District) at their addresses as they
appear in the registration books maintained by the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture a notice that
such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date named in such notice, which date shall not
be less than 30 days after the date of the mailing of such notice, the balance of such money then
unclaimed will be returned to the District.

analysis of the District’s financial performance during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007. This 
information  is  presented  in  conjunction  with  the  audited  basic  financial  statements,  which  follow  this 
section. 
 
 
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 
 

¾ The  District’s  net  assets  increased  by  $15.3  million  or  4.1  percent  from  $372.6  million  to  $387.9 

million. 

¾ Operating revenues decreased by $0.6 million or 0.9 percent from $64.6 million to $64.0 million. 
¾ Operating expenses increased by $2.8 million or 4.7 percent from $59.0 million to $61.8 million. 
¾ Capital contributions to the District decreased by $0.8 million or 16.7 percent from $4.8 million to 

$4.0 million. 

¾ Among  the  significant  projects  completed  during  the  fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2008  were

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
The financial statements consist of the following three parts: Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Basic 
Financial  Statements  and  Other  Required  Supplementary  Information.    The  Financial  Statements  include 
notes which explain in detail some of the information included in the financial statements. 
 
 
REQUIRED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
The  Financial  Statements  of  the  District  report  information  utilizing  the  full  accrual  basis  of  accounting.  
The  Financial  Statements  conform  to  accounting  principles  which  are  generally  accepted  in  the  United 
States of America.  The Comparative Statements of Net Assets include information on the District’s assets 
and liabilities and provide information about the nature and amounts of investments in resources (assets) 
and the obligations to District creditors (liabilities).  The Comparative Statements of Activities and Changes 
in Net Assets identify the District’s revenues and expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007.  
This statement provides information on the District’s operations over the past two fiscal years and can be 
used to determine whether the District has recovered all of its actual and projected costs through user fees 
and  other  charges.    The  third  financial  statement  is  the  Comparative  Statements  of  Cash  Flows.    This 
statement provides information on the District’s cash receipts, cash payments and changes in cash resulting 
from operations, investments and financing activities.  From the Comparative Statements of Cash Flows, 
the reader can obtain comparative information on the source and use of cash and the change in the cash and 
cash equivalents balance for each of the last two fiscal years.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRICT 
 
The  Comparative  Statements  of  Net  Assets  (page  10)  and  the  Comparative  Statements  of  Activities  and 
Changes in Net Assets (page 11) provide an indication of the District’s financial condition and also indicate 
whether the financial condition of the District improved during the last fiscal year.  The District’s net assets 
reflect the difference between assets and liabilities. An increase in net assets over time typically indicates an 
improvement in financial condition.

As the above table indicates, total assets increased by $16.3 million from $439.9 million to $456.2 million 
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.  This is comprised of an increase of $12.8 million in current and 
other assets and an increase of $3.5 million in capital assets.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, total 
assets  increased  by  $17.5  million  from  $422.4  million  to  $439.9  million.  This  increase  consisted  of  $16.1 
million in current and other assets and an increase of $1.4 million in capital assets. The increases in each 
year in current and other assets and in capital assets reflect favorable operations and planned accumulation 
of  reserves  for  upcoming  major  capital  projects  that  are  identified  in  the  District’s  long  range  Capital 
Improvement Program. Projects scheduled for the upcoming fiscal year 2009 include phase 2 expansion of 
the  Desalination  Facility  and  process  upgrades  at  Water  Treatment  Plant  Nos.  1  &  2  and  PT  Blending 
Facilities,  tank  and  reservoir  seismic  upgrades,  Distribution  System  seismic  improvement  study,  main 
replacements,  upgrades,  and  relocations,  security  improvements  at  various  facilities,  Rubber  Dam  2 
modifications, and ARP Well upgrades and site improvements.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRICT, Continued 
 
For  fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2008,  total  liabilities  reflect  an  increase  of  $0.9  million  due  mainly  to  an 
increase  in  the  amount  of  outstanding  accounts  payable,  accrued  expenses  and  contractor  and  customer 
deposits  that  were  partially  offset  by  the  reduction  in  long  term  debt  as  a  result  of  scheduled  principal 
payments during the fiscal year. For fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, total liabilities reflect a decrease of $0.2 
million due mainly to the scheduled principal payment on outstanding long-term debt and a reduction in 
the amount of outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenues that was partially 
offset by an increase in contractor and customer deposits. 
 
Table 1 also indicates that total net assets increased by $15.3 million from $372.6 million to $387.9 million for 
fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.  This increase is due to an increase of $5.2 million in net assets invested in 
capital assets, net of related debt and an increase of $10.2 million in unrestricted net assets.  For fiscal year 
ended  June  30,  2007,  total  net  assets  increased  by  $17.7  million  due  to  an  increase  of  $2.7  million  in  net 
assets  invested  in  capital  assets,  net  of  related  debt  and  an  increase  of  $15.0  million  in  unrestricted  net 
assets. These figures reflect the District’s continued emphasis on improving its capital infrastructure and 
prudent long range financial planning.

The  Comparative  Statements  of  Activities  and  Changes  in  Net  Assets  identify  the  various  revenue  and 
expense items which impact the change in net assets.  As the information in Table 2 indicates, income before 
capital  contributions  of  $11.3  million  and  capital  contributions  of  $4.0  million  were  the  two  items  which 
resulted in an increase of $15.3 million in net assets by the end of the 2007/08 fiscal year. In the previous 
2006/07 fiscal year, income before capital contributions of $13.0 million and capital contributions of $4.8 
million were the two items which resulted in an increase of $17.8 million in net assets.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRICT, Continued 
 
For  fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2008,  Table  2  indicates  that  the  District’s  total  revenues  increased  by  $1.0 
million or 1.3 percent to $76.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 from $75.0 million in the prior 
year.  Increases in revenue from water sales ($0.8 million), investment income ($0.8 million), property taxes 
($0.8 million) and development related fees including facilities connection charges ($0.6 million) were offset 
by a reduction in fees, rental and other revenues ($1.9 million). The increase in water sales revenue was due 
primarily  to  a  water  rate  increase  and  accrued  unbilled  water  revenues  that  was  partially  offset  by  a 
reduction in water consumption.  Investment income was higher due to larger average cash balances on 
hand  during  the  fiscal  year.    The  increase  in  property  tax  revenue  reflects  growth  and  property 
reassessments in the District’s portion of the one percent county-wide property tax allocation and increases 
in the State Water Contract Tax levy to fund increased costs in the groundwater portion of the District’s 
State  Water  Project  costs.  Reductions  in  project  specific  grant  funding  and  other  reimbursements 
contributed largely to the decrease in other revenues during the fiscal year.   Total expenses increased by 
$2.7  million  or  4.4  percent  during  the  2007/08  fiscal  year.  This  was  due  primarily  to  increasing  costs  in 
operating  expenses  including  purchased  water  costs,  water  treatment,  and  administration  and  general 
expenses. 
 
For fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the District’s total revenues increased by $10.8 million or 16.8 percent.  
Increases in revenue from water sales ($3.9 million), investment income ($2.0 million), property taxes ($3.2 
million), fees, rental and other revenues ($1.9 million) were offset by a reduction in development related 
fees  including  facilities  connection  charges  ($.3  million).  The  increase  in  water  sales  revenue  was  due 
primarily  to  a  water  rate  increase  and  increases  in  consumption  and  accrued  unbilled  water  revenues.  
Investment  income  was  higher  due  to  larger  cash  balances  on  hand  and  increase  in  interest  rates.    The 
increase in property tax revenue reflects the end of the two year State of California property tax take-away 
and  return  to  normal  levels  of  property  tax  collections.  Grant  funding  and  other  reimbursements 
contributed  to  the  increase  in  other  revenues  during  the  fiscal  year.      Total  expenses  increased  by  $4.4 
million or 7.6 percent during the 2006/07 fiscal year. This increase was due primarily to higher operating 
expenses including purchased water costs and distribution system maintenance expenses.  
 
CAPITAL ASSETS  
 
As of June 30, 2008, the District’s investment in capital assets totaled $314.5 million, which is an increase of 
$3.5 million or 1.1 percent over the capital asset balance of $311.0 million at June 30, 2007. In the previous 
fiscal year, the District’s investment in capital assets increased by $1.4 million or 0.5 percent over the capital 
asset  balance  of  $309.6  million  at  June  30,  2006.  Capital  assets  include  all  of  the  District’s  major  capital 
assets, including infrastructure assets, water treatment facilities, water mains, pipes and storage reservoirs, 
land, District headquarters and other structures, as well as vehicles and other equipment with a value of 
$5,000 or more. A comparison of the District’s capital assets over the past three fiscal years is presented in 
Table 3.

There were several capital projects completed during the 2007/08 fiscal year that contributed to the overall 
increase in capital assets, including the construction and main relocations related to the Washington Blvd 
Grade Separation Project, Centerville 24” pipeline and Irvington 48” pipeline relocations, construction of 
monitoring  wells,  Mowry  and  PT  Wellfield  equipment  replacement,  Alameda  Creek  Pipeline  No.  1  Fish 
Screen Project, Lago Los Osos Diversion Pipeline, rehabilitation of Bellflower Well, upgrade of the District’s 
2-way radio system, enhancements to water quality databases, and various computer system and network 
upgrades. In addition to these completed projects, there were also a number of major capital projects that 
were under construction or in progress as of June 30, 2008.  Those projects included the expansion of the 
Newark  Desalination  Facility,  WTP1  and  WTP2  process  upgrades,  PT  Blending  Facility  Chemical  Feed 
Upgrades, Alameda Reservoir water quality enhancements, tank and reservoir seismic upgrades, various 
water main replacements and upgrades, distribution system seismic improvement study, security upgrades 
at various District facilities and Rubber Dam 2 modifications. 
 
Major completed projects contributing to the increase in capital assets during the 2006/07 fiscal year include 
construction  and  main  relocations  related  to  the  Paseo  Padre  Grade  Separation  Project,  upgrade  of  large 
meters, design of the 16” Mission Blvd. Pipeline, rehabilitation of Peralta-Tyson Wells 4 & 6, update of the 
Integrated  Resources  Plan,  construction  of  monitoring  wells,  and  process  upgrades  at  Water  Treatment 
Plant No. 2.  
 
Additional information on the District’s capital assets and construction commitments is provided in Note 5 
(page 25) of the financial statements.

LONG-TERM DEBT 
 
As of June 30, 2008, the District had $54.6 million in outstanding debt compared to $56.3 million on June 30, 
2007 and $58.0 million on June 30, 2006.  The decreases in outstanding debt represent principal payments of 
$1.7  million  in  each  of  the  fiscal  years  ended  June  30,  2008  and  June  30,  2007.  Revenues  certificates  of 
participation in the amount of $25 million were issued in November 2003 to fund costs associated with the 
construction of a desalination facility and associated pipelines and upgrades to the Mission San Jose Water 
Treatment Plant.  This debt will be paid in annual installments through the year 2028.  The outstanding debt 
also includes a note payable which was issued in 1993 to fund property acquisition costs and is being paid 
in annual installments through the year 2011 as well as refunding bonds which were issued in 1998.  The 
refunding revenue bonds in the amount of $46.6 million were issued to prepay and defease outstanding 
certificates  of  participation  which  were  issued  in  1992  and  1995  at  a  higher  interest  rate.    These  bonds 
mature in 2020.  The District has covenanted that it will fix, prescribe and collect rates, fees and charges for 
use of the District’s water system during each fiscal year which are at least sufficient to yield in each fiscal 
year net revenues equal to 125 percent of the debt service for such fiscal year, plus any amount necessary to 
restore the bond reserve fund to the reserve requirement. 
 
Additional  information  on  the  District’s  long-term  debt  is  provided  in  Note  8  (page  27)  of  the  financial 
statements. 
 
 
ECONOMIC FACTORS AND NEXT YEAR’S BUDGET AND RATES 
 
The Board of Directors adopted the District’s third two-year budget on June 7, 2007. The approval of a two-
year budget provides funding for the District’s operating, capital and debt service costs for the 2007/08 and 
2008/09  fiscal  years.  The  District’s  water  rates  are  reviewed  by  staff  and  the  Board  of  Directors  on  an 
annual basis. Water rates were last adjusted in February 2008 with the implementation of an increase of 
four and one-half percent. Rate increases over the past five years have been minimal with the District’s rates 
remaining in the lower one-third of thirty other water agencies surveyed in the Bay Area.

Alameda County Water District  
Notes to Basic Financial Statements 
For the years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 
 
 
1.  DESCRIPTION OF THE REPORTING ENTITY 
 
A. Description of Operations 
 

The Alameda County Water District (the District) was organized under the California Water Act of 1913 
and  is  governed  by  a  five-person  Board  of  Directors.    Principal  functions  of  the  District  include  the 
importation, conservation, and distribution of water.  District operations are conducted under the State 
Water Code of California. 

 
B. Reporting Entity 
 

The financial reporting entity consists of the Alameda County Water District (the primary government) 
and its component unit, which is discussed below.  Component units are legally separate organizations 
for  which  the  Board  of  Directors  is  financially  accountable,  or  other  organizations  whose  nature  and 
significant  relationship  with  the  District  are  such  that  exclusion  would  cause  the  District’s  financial 
statements to be misleading or incomplete. 
 
As  required  by  GAAP,  these  basic  financial  statements  present  the  District  and  its  component  units, 
entities  for  which  the  District  is  considered  to  be  financially  accountable.    Blended  component  units, 
although legally separate entities are, in substance, part of the District’s operations and data from these 
units are combined with data of the District. Each blended component unit has a June 30 year-end.  The 
District  had  no  discretely  presented  component  units.    The  following  entity  is  reported  as  a  blended 
component unit: 
 

The  Alameda  County  Water  District  Public  Facilities  Financing  Corporation  (the 
Corporation)  was  established  in  1992  to  issue  debt  for  the  benefit  of  the  District.  
Additional  financial  data  for  the  Alameda  County  Water  District  Public  Facilities 
Financing Corporation may be obtained from the Alameda County Water District office 
at 43885 South Grimmer Boulevard, Fremont, California, 94537. 

 
 
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
A. Basis of Presentation and Measurement Focus 
 

The accounts of the District are reported in a proprietary fund type, specifically, an enterprise fund.  The 
activities of this fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise the 
District’s assets, liabilities, net assets, revenues and expenses.  Enterprise Funds account for activities (i) 
that are financed with debt that is secured solely by a pledge of the net revenues from fees and charges 
of  the  activity;  or  (ii)  that  are  required  by  laws  or  regulations  that  the  activity’s  costs  of  providing 
services,  including  capital  costs  (such  as  depreciation  or  debt  service),  be  recovered  with  fees  and 
charges,  rather  than  with  taxes  or  similar  revenues;  or  (iii)  that  the  pricing  policies  of  the  activity 
establish fees and charges designed to recover its costs, including capital costs (such as depreciation or 
debt service).

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, Continued 
 
A.  Basis of Presentation and Measurement Focus, Continued 
 

The  accounting  and  financial  reporting  treatment  applied  to  the  District  is  determined  by  its 
measurement focus.  The transactions of the District are accounted for on a flow of economic resources 
measurement  focus.    With  this  measurement  focus,  all  assets  and  all  liabilities  associated  with  the 
operations  are  included  on  the  Statements  of  Net  Assets.    Net  assets  (i.e.,  total  assets  net  of  total 
liabilities) are segregated into invested in capital assets, net of related debt; restricted for debt service; 
and unrestricted components. 
 
The District’s basic financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting and conform to 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.   
 
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recognized in the period in which they are earned 
while expenses are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred. The receivables have been 
recorded as revenue and provisions have been made for uncollectible amounts. The District has elected 
under Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 20, Accounting and Financial 
Reporting for Proprietary Funds and Other Governmental Activities That Use Proprietary Fund Accounting, to 
apply all applicable GASB pronouncements as well as any applicable pronouncements of the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board, the Accounting Principles Board, or any Accounting Research Bulletins 
issued on or before November 30, 1989, unless these pronouncements conflict with or contradict GASB 
pronouncements. 

 
B. Cash and Investments 
 

The  District’s  cash  deposits  are  considered  to  be  cash  on  hand,  demand  deposits,  and  highly  liquid 
investments with original maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. 
 
In accordance with GASB Statement No. 40, Deposit and Investment Disclosures (Amendment of GASB 
No. 3), certain disclosure requirements for Deposits and Investment Risks were made in the following 
areas: 
 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 Credit Risk 
 Overall 
 Custodial Credit Risk 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk 

 
In  addition,  other  disclosures  are  specified  including  use  of  certain  methods  to  present  deposits  and 
investments, highly sensitive investments, credit quality at year-end and other disclosures. 
 
In  accordance  with  GASB  Statement  No.  31,  Accounting  and  Financial  Reporting  for  Certain 
Investments and for External Investment Pools, highly liquid market investments with maturities of one 
year or less at time of purchase are stated at amortized cost.  All other investments are stated at fair 
value.  Market value is used as fair value for those securities for which market quotations are readily 
available.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, Continued 
 
B. Cash and Investments, Continued 
 

Restricted  investments,  which  consist  primarily  of  U.S.  government  securities  designated  for  specific 
projects and required to be segregated pursuant to debt covenants, and restricted cash, which consists 
primarily of money market accounts, are presented as restricted cash and investments. 

 
C. Accrued Unbilled Revenue 
 

 
D. Materials and Supplies 
 

 
E. Capital Assets 
 

During the year, customer water meters are read and billed on monthly or bimonthly periods.  Because 
not every meter is read on the same date, revenue for water distributed but not yet billed is accrued at 
fiscal year-end to match revenues with related expenses. 

Materials and supplies inventory consisted principally of spare parts that are recorded when purchased 
and expensed when used and is recorded at weighted average cost. 

The  cost  of  additions  to  the  utility  plant  and  major  replacements  of  retired  units  of  property  is 
capitalized.    The  District  defines  capital  assets  as  assets  with  an  initial,  individual  cost  of  more  than 
$5,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of two years.  Cost includes direct labor, outside services, 
materials and transportation, employee fringe benefits and overhead.  The District was not required to 
capitalize interest during fiscal years 2008 and 2007.  The cost and accumulated depreciation of property 
sold  or  retired  is  deducted  from  capital  assets,  and  any  profit  or  loss  resulting  from  the  disposal  is 
credited or charged in the nonoperating section of the statements of revenues, expenses and changes in 
net  assets.    The  cost  of  current  repairs,  maintenance,  and  minor  replacements  is  charged  to  expense.  
Construction in progress primarily relates to upgrades of existing facilities. 
 
Depreciation has been provided over estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method.  
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
 

Structures, reservoirs, pumps and other improvements
Office furniture, fixtures and equipment
Motor vehicles

20-50 years
   2-10 years
         5 years

 

 
F. Long-Term Debt and Related Costs 
 

Long-term  debt  is  reported  at  face  value,  net  of  applicable  premium,  discounts  and  deferred  loss  on 
refunding.  Costs related to the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the various 
debt issues and are shown as an asset on the Statement of Net Assets.  Losses occurring from advance 
refunding  of  debt  are  deferred  and  amortized  as  interest  expense  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  old 
bonds, or the life of the new bonds, whichever is shorter.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, Continued 
 
G. Operating Revenues and Expenses 
 

Operating  revenues  and  expenses  consisted  of  those  revenues  that  result  from  the  ongoing  principal 
operations  of  the  District. 
  Operating  revenues  consisted  primarily  of  charges  for  services.  
Nonoperating  revenues  and  expenses  consisted  of  those  revenues  and  expenses  that  are  related  to 
financing  and  investing  type  of  activities  and  resulted  from  non-exchange  transactions  or  ancillary 
activities.    When  an  expense  is  incurred  for  purposes  for  which  there  are  both  restricted  and 
unrestricted net assets available, it is the District’s policy to apply those expenses to restricted net assets 
to the extent such are available and then to unrestricted net assets. 

 
H. Property Tax Revenue 
 

Assessed values are determined annually by the Alameda County Assessor (the County) as of January 
1,  and  become  a  lien  on  real  property  as  of  the  following  July  1.    Taxes  are  due  November  1,  and 
February 1 and are delinquent if not paid by December 10 and April 10, respectively.  The County is 
permitted by State Law (Proposition 13) to levy taxes at 1% of the full market value of the property (at 
the  time  of  purchase)  and  can  only  increase  the  property’s  assessed  valuation  by  reappraisals  of 
property  due  to  new  construction  or  change.    The  County  can  also  increase  the  property’s  assessed 
valuation for cost of living increases up to a maximum of 2% per year.  Property taxes collected by the 
taxing authority, but not remitted to the District at year-end, are accrued as revenue and included as 
taxes receivable.  Revenue from property taxes is recognized in the fiscal year for which the taxes are 
levied. 

Transmission and distribution system assets contributed to the District by installers are capitalized at 
the installers’ costs, which approximated fair value at the time of the District’s acquisition, and recorded 
as capital contributions when received. 

 
I. Capital Contributions 
 

 
J. Net Assets 
 

In the Government-Wide Financial Statements, net assets are classified in the following categories:  
 

Invested  in  Capital  Assets,  Net  of  Related  Debt  –  This  amount  consists  of  capital  assets  net  of 
accumulated depreciation and reduced by outstanding debt that attributed to the acquisition, 
construction, or improvement of the assets. 
 
Restricted  –  This  amount  is  restricted  by  external  creditors,  grantors,  contributors,  laws  or 
regulations of other governments. 
 
Unrestricted – This amount is all net assets that do not meet the definition of “invested in capital 
assets, net of related debt” or “restricted net assets.”

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, Continued 
 
K. Use of Estimates 
 

The  preparation  of  the  basic  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions 
affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and 
liabilities.    In  addition, estimates  affect  the  reported  amount  of  expenses.    Actual  results  could  differ 
from these estimates and assumptions. 

 
L. Reclassification 
 

Certain reclassifications may have been made to the prior year financial statements in order to conform 
to the current year presentation. 

 
M. Implementation of New GASB Pronouncements 
 

In  2008,  the  District  adopted  new  accounting  standards  in  order  to  conform  to  the  following 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statements: 

 

x GASB Statement No. 48, Sales and Pledges of Receivables and Future Revenues and Intra-
Entity  Transfers  of  Assets  and  Future  Revenues  -  This  Statement  establishes  accounting 
and financial reporting standards for transactions in which a government receives, or 
is  entitled  to,  resources  in  exchange  for  future  cash  flows  generated  by  collecting 
specific receivables or specific future revenues. In addition, this Statement establishes 
accounting and financial reporting standards that apply to all intra-entity transfers of 
assets and future revenues.   

 
x GASB Statement No. 50, Pension Disclosures – An Amendment of GASB Statements No. 25 
and  27  -  This  Statement  more  closely  aligns  the  financial  reporting  requirements  for 
pensions  with  those  for  other  postemployment  benefits  (OPEB)  and,  in  doing  so, 
enhances  information  disclosed  in  notes  to  financial  statements  or  presented  as 
required  supplementary  information  (RSI)  by  pension  plans  and  by  employers  that 
provide pension benefits. 

 
 
3.  CASH AND INVESTMENTS 
 
The District maintains an internal cash and investment pool in a single enterprise fund.  Certain restricted 
funds that are held and invested by independent outside custodians through contractual agreements are 
not pooled, and are reported as cash with fiscal agents.

The District’s investment policy is adopted annually by the District board in accordance with California 
Government Code Section 53601, and has as its objectives the following (in order of priority): 
 

¾ Safety:    Safety  of  principal  is  the  foremost  objective  of  the  investment  program.  
Investments  of  the  District  shall  be  undertaken  in  a  manner  that  seeks  to  ensure  the 
preservation  of  capital  in  the  overall  portfolio.    To  attain  this  objective,  diversification  is 
required in the portfolio’s composition. 

¾ Liquidity:  The portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating requirements, 
which might be reasonably anticipated.  Liquidity refers to the ability to sell an investment 
at any given moment with a minimal chance of losing some portion of principal or interest. 
¾ Yield:    The  portfolio  shall  be  designed  to  attain  a  market  rate  of  return  throughout 
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and the 
cash flow characteristics of the portfolio. 

 
Under provisions of the District’s investment policy, the District may invest in the following types of 
investments: 
 

¾ The Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) maintained by the State of California. 
¾ Obligations issued by agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. Government. 
¾ Bankers’ acceptances with a term not to exceed 180 days. 
¾ Prime commercial paper with a term not to exceed 270 days and the highest rating issued by 

Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, on the date of purchase. 

¾ Negotiable certificates of deposit issued by federally chartered or state-chartered banks or 

associations. 

¾ Medium-term notes issued by corporations organized and operating in the United States. 
¾ United States Treasury notes, bonds, bills or other obligations for which full faith and credit 

of the United States are pledged for payment. 

¾ The California Asset Management Program (CAMP). 
 

A  three-year  maximum  maturity  for  each  investment  is  allowed  unless  an  extension  of  maturity  is 
granted by the District Board.

B. Authorized Investments, Continued 
 

 
In  accordance  with  Section  53651  of  the  California  Government  Code,  the  District  cannot  invest  in 
inverse floaters, range notes, or interest-only strips that are derived from a pool of mortgages, or in any 
security that could result in zero interest accrual if held to maturity.  The limitation does not apply to 
investments in shares of beneficial interest issued under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that are 
authorized investments under Section 53601 of the California Government Code. 

 
C.  Deposits 
 

D.  Investments 

The  carrying  amount  of  the  District’s  deposits  were  a  positive  balance  of  $554,600  and  a  negative 
balance  of  $706,400  and  the  bank  balances  were  $1,385,200  and  $889,500  at  June  30,  2008  and  2007, 
respectively.  The difference between the bank balance and the carrying amount represents outstanding 
checks  and  deposits  in  transit.    Of  the  bank  balances,  $500,000  were  insured  by  the  Federal  Deposit 
Insurance  Corporation  and  the  remainder  was  collateralized  by  the  pledging  financial  institutions  as 
required by California Government Code at June 30, 2008. 
 
The California Government Code requires California banks and savings and loans associations to secure 
the District’s deposits not covered by federal depository insurance by pledging government securities as 
collateral.    The  fair  value  of  pledged  securities  must  equal  at  least  110%  of  the  District’s  deposits  or 
150%  of  mortgage-backed  collateral.    The  collateral  must  be  held  at  the  pledging  bank’s  trust 
department or other bank, acting as the pledging bank’s agent, in the District’s name. 
 

 
The District’s cash and investments are invested pursuant to investment policy guidelines established 
by the Board of Directors.  The objectives of the policy are, in order of priority:  safety, liquidity and 
yield.  The policy addresses the soundness of financial institutions in which the District deposits funds 
and the types of investments instruments as permitted by the California Government Code. 
 
The District is a voluntary participant in the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) which is regulated by 
California Government Code and is under the oversight of the Treasurer of the State of California.  The fair 
value of the District’s position in the pool is the same as the value of the pool shares. 
 
The District’s investments with LAIF at June 30, 2008 and 2007, included a portion of the pool funds 
invested in Structured Notes and Asset-Backed Securities.  These investments included the following: 
 

Structured  Notes  are  debt  securities  (other  than  asset-backed  securities)  whose  cash-flow 
characteristics (coupon rate, redemption amount, or stated maturity) depend upon one or more 
indices and/or that have embedded forwards or options. 

 

Asset-Backed Securities, the bulk of which are mortgage-backed securities, entitle their purchasers to 
receive a share of the cash flows from a pool of assets, such as principal and interest repayments 
from a pool of mortgages (such as CMO’s) or credit card receivables.

As of June 30, 2008 and 2007, the District had $21,790,500 and $15,085,800, respectively invested in LAIF, 
which had invested 14.72% and 3.466% of the pooled investment funds in Structured Notes and Asset-
Backed  Securities.    The  District  valued  its  investments  in  LAIF  as  of  June  30,  2008  and  2007,  by 
multiplying its account balance with LAIF times a fair value factor determined by LAIF.  This fair value 
factor was determined by dividing all LAIF participants’ total aggregate fair value by total aggregate 
amortized cost resulting in a factor of 0.999950219 and 0.999545022, respectively. 
 
As of June 30, 2008 and 2007, the District’s investment in the CAMP pool was $1,228,100 and $1,428,200 
respectively.  The total amount invested by all public agencies in CAMP at that date was $2,010,064,100 
and  $1,366,043,900,  respectively.    A  board  of  five  trustees  who  are  officials  or  employees  of  public 
agencies has oversight responsibility for CAMP.  The value of the pool shares in CAMP, which maybe 
withdrawn at anytime, is determined on an amortized cost basis, which is different from the fair value 
of the District’s position in the pool.

F.  Risks 
 

Interest Rate Risk.  As a means of limiting its exposure to fair value losses arising from rising interest 
rates, the District’s investment policy provides that final maturities of securities cannot exceed three 
years.  Specific maturities of investments depend on liquidity needs.  At June 30, 2008, the District’s 
pooled cash and investments had the following maturities: 
 

 

 

Maturity

Less than one year
One to three years

 
The average life of the portfolio was 289 days.

Credit Risk.  Credit risk is the risk that a security or a portfolio will lose some or all of its value due to a 
real  or  perceived  change  in  the  ability  of  the  issuer  to  repay  its  debt.  According  to  the  District’s 
investment policy, no more than 25% of the total portfolio may be invested in commercial paper and no 
more  than  40%  of  the  total  portfolio  may  be  invested  in  bankers’  acceptances  other  than  the  US 
Government,  its  agencies  and  instrumentalities  and  LAIF.   If  a  security  is  downgraded  by  either 
Moody’s  or  S&P  to  a  level  below  the  minimum  quality  required  by  the  District,  the  District  will 
determine  whether  to  retain  or  liquidate  the  security  based  upon  criteria  set  forth  in  the  District’s 
Investment Policy. 
 
At June 30, 2008, the District had the following investments credit risk ratings:

Custodial Credit Risk.  For an investment, custodial credit risk is the risk that, in the event of the failure 
of the counter party, the District will not be able to recover the value of its investments or collateral 
securities that are in the possession of an outside party.  All securities, with the exception of the money 
market funds and LAIF, are held by a third-party custodian (BNY Western Trust).  BNY is a registered 
member of the Federal Reserve Bank.  The securities held by BNY are in street name, and a customer 
number assigned to the District identifies ownership. 

 
G.  Fair Value of Investments 
 

GASB  Statement  No.  31,  Accounting  and  Financial  Reporting  for  Certain  Investments  and  for  External 
Investment Pools, requires that the District’s investments be carried at fair market value instead of cost.  
Accordingly, the District adjusts the carrying value of its investments to reflect their fair value at each 
fiscal  year-end  and  the effects  of  these  adjustments  are  included  in  income  for  that  fiscal  year.    The 
calculation of realized gains and losses is independent of the calculation of the change in the fair value 
of investments and realized gains and losses of the current period include unrealized amounts from 
prior  periods.    Changes  in  value  in  the  fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2008  amounted  to  an  unrealized 
increase of $333,900.

In 1996 and in 2001, the District entered into two agreements for a water banking and exchange program 
with Semitropic Water Storage District and its Improvement District (Semitropic).  The entities are used for 
storage, withdrawal, and exchange rights for the District's State Water Project supplies. As of June 30, 2008, 
Semitropic's total capital component cost was $183.5 million adjusted annually by the Construction Costs 
Index. Under the two agreements, the District's combined share of the total Capital Component Cost is a 
15% vesting in the program.  Under the 1996 agreement (for 5% of the Semitropic program capacity), the 
District pays the capital component when storing and recovering water.  Under the 2001 agreement (for an 
additional  10%  of  the  program  capacity),  the District  has paid  for  the  capital  costs  through  fixed  annual 
payments.  For the year ended June 30, 2008, the District has capitalized $26.7 million which includes all 
costs  associated  with  storage,  power,  operations  &  maintenance  fees  and  take  costs.   The  agreements 
terminate in November 2035. 
 
The District had a storage allocation of 150,000 acre-feet and had approximately 122,687 and 127,244 acre 
feet of water at June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  During fiscal year 2004, the District’s management 
changed it method of estimating its cost of usage of its supplemental water storage costs.  In prior years, the 
District’s procedures would be to reduce its costs when the District used the supplemental water supply.  In 
fiscal  year  2004,  the  costs  of  the  District’s  water  storage  is  amortized  over  the  remaining  life  of  the 
agreement.  This change resulted in the recognition of amortization expense in the amount of $835,200 and 
$747,500 for the years ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively.

1998 Water System Refunding Revenue Bonds 
 
On December 1, 1998, the District issued $46,650,000 of refunding revenue bonds (the 1998 Revenue Bonds) 
to  refund  the  1992  and  1995  Water  System  Project  Certificates  of  Participation  (the  Certificates).    The 
installment Bonds have interest rates ranging from 3.5% to 4.75% and are payable in installments ranging 
from  $1,635,000  to  $3,400,000  through  June  1,  2020.    The  net  proceeds  from  the  issuance  were  used  to 
purchase U.S. government securities which were deposited in an irrevocable trust with an escrow agent to 
provide debt service payments until June 1, 2005, when the 1995 Certificates were repaid at a prepayment 
price equal to the principal amount of the 1995 Certificates then outstanding plus a prepayment premium of 
2%  of  such  principal  amount.    The  1998  Revenue  Bonds  are  payable  solely  from  and  secured  by  the 
revenues  received  from  the  operation  of  the  District’s  water  system.    Annual  principal  and  interest 
payments on the bonds are expected to require less than 10 percent of net revenues.  The total principal and 
interest remaining to be paid on the bonds is $41,738,900.  Principal and interest paid for the current year 
and total water net revenues were $3,354,100 and $58,087,000, respectively.   
 
The debt service requirements for the bonds at June 30, 2008 were as follows:

In  November  2003,  the  District  issued  $25,000,000  of  Revenues  Certificates  of  Participation  (2003  COP 
Bonds).  The District had built a desalination facility and associated pipelines and upgraded its Mission San 
Jose Water Treatment Plant treatment process to an ultra filtration membrane process (Project).  The District 
has used the net proceeds and reimbursed itself for these and related capital cost.  The Certificates have 
interest rates ranging from 4.6% to 5.25% and they are payable in installments ranging from $2,615,000 to 
$3,695,000 starting from 2021 through 2028.  The 2003 COP Bonds are payable solely from and secured by

9.  INSTALLERS’ REIMBURSEMENT 
 
The  District  has  agreements  to  reimburse  certain  developers  for  a  portion  of  the  cost  as  defined  by  the 
District,  of  oversized  mains,  main  extensions,  and  storage  tanks  constructed  or  installed  by  them  at  the 
request of the District.  The terms of the agreements provide that such costs are reimbursable over a period 
of up to ten years out of certain cash receipts collected from contractors subsequently connecting to those 
previously installed mains.  Such receipts are deposited in a cash deposits account separately for transmittal 
to the developers.  The amount of such receipts, which had not been remitted as of June 30, 2008 and 2007, 
were $1,279,500 and $1,267,200, respectively, and are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 
the  accompanying  Statements  of  Net  Assets.    In  the  event  that  the  designated  future  cash  receipts  from 
contractors are not adequate to fully reimburse the developers for the eligible construction cost incurred by 
the end of the ten-year period, the District will have no future obligation to the developers. 
 
 
10.  RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; 
injuries  to  employees;  and  natural  disasters.    The  District  participates  in  the  Special  District  Risk 
Management Authority Property and Liability Insurance Program for risk of loss.  The program provides 
general  liability,  property,  commercial  auto,  boiler  and  machinery,  employment  practices,  employee 
dishonesty coverage, employment benefits liability, public official errors and omissions and public official 
personal liability insurance coverage. 
 
Prior to August 1, 2002, the District managed and financed some of these risks by purchasing commercial 
insurance for their worker’s compensation and employer’s liability.  On August 1, 2002, the District joined 
the  Special  Districts  Workers  Compensation  Authority  (the  Authority).    The  Authority  is  composed  of 
California  public  entities  and  is  organized  under  a  joint  powers  agreement  pursuant  to  California 
Government  Code  Section  6500,  et  seq.    The  purpose  of  the  Authority  is  to  arrange  and  administer 
programs  for  the  pooling  of  self-insurance  losses,  to  purchase  excess  insurance  or  reinsurance,  and  to 
arrange for group-purchased insurance and administrative services.  The Authority’s pool began covering 
claims  of  its  members  in  1982.    The  Board  of  Directors  is  composed  of  three  members  appointed  by  the 
Board of Directors of the California Special Districts Association and four members elected by the districts 
who are participating in the Authority. 
 
The District did not have settled claims that exceeded the District’s insurance coverage in any of the past 
three years. 
 
The District’s deductibles and maximum coverage are as follows:

11.  COMMITMENTS 
 
In 1961, the District entered into a contract with the State of California (the State) to purchase water through 
the year 2035.  After the initial term, the contract is renewable indefinitely by the District under essentially 
the same conditions as the original contract upon six months prior written notice to the State.  The District’s 
actual  water  usage  for  fiscal  years  2008  and  2007  were  approximately  20,100  and  15,800  acre-feet, 
respectively.  The entitlement will be 42,000 acre-feet during fiscal year 2008 and thereafter.  In any year 
when the entitlement is in excess of the District’s needs, the State will attempt to sell such excess and credit 
the District.  The costs to the District for water purchased under this contract for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 
were approximately $5,414,500 and $4,260,100, respectively, and were charged to operations as incurred. 
 
The District’s water is delivered to it through facilities operated and constructed by the State.  The cost of 
the  water  is  determined  annually  by  the  State and  includes  reimbursement  to  the  State  for  the  District’s 
portion of the costs of construction and operation of these facilities. 
 
The District’s commitment under the State water contract will remain in effect until 2036 or until the cost of 
the State’s facilities is recovered, whichever is longer.  The commitment is subject to increase in future years 
as a result of additional improvements of higher-than-anticipated operating costs, and is projected by the 
State to be $176,628,600 as of June 30, 2008 which was based on June 30, 2007 amount provided by the State.

The  District  entered  into  a  contract  with  the  San  Francisco  Water  Department  (SFWD)  in  June  1984  to 
purchase  certain  minimum  amounts  of  water  over  a  25-year  period.    The  costs  to  the  District  for  water 
purchased under this contract for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 were approximately $8,249,600 and $8,538,300, 
respectively, and were charged to operations as incurred.  The District is obligated under the term of the 
agreement  to  make  a  minimum  purchase  of  9,020  acre-feet  of  water  per  year  through  2010  at  the  then-
current  cost  of  water.    In  the  event  that  the  SFWD  is  unable  to  supply  sufficient  water  to  all  users,  the 
available water will be apportioned among the users ratably, with the District liable only for water actually 
delivered.    For  fiscal  year  2008,  the  estimated  cost  of  the  minimum  purchase  commitment  was 
approximately $5,107,300.  In fiscal year 2009, the District expects to purchase 13,875 acre-feet of water for a 
total price of approximately $9,014,700.

B. Funding Policy 
 

C. Annual Pension Cost 
 

Active plan members are required by state statute to contribute 8% of their annual covered salary.  The 
District was required to contribute for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 at an actuarially determined rate of 
19.210%  and  19.138%  of  annual  covered  payroll  for  the  District’s  employees,  which  amounted  to 
$3,209,700 and $3,132,900 for the years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007.   
 

For fiscal year 2008 and 2007, the District’s annual pension cost of $3,209,700 for PERS was equal to the 
District’s required and actual contributions.  The required contribution was determined as part of the 
June  30,  2006  actuarial  valuation  using  the  entry  age  normal  actuarial  cost  method.    The  actuarial 
assumptions included (a) 7.75% investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses), (b) projected 
annual salary increases ranging from 3.25% to 14.45% and (c) 3.25% per year cost-of-living adjustments.  
Both  (a)  and  (b)  included  an  inflation  component  of  3.0%.    The  actuarial  value  of  PERS  assets  was 
determined  using  techniques  that  smooth  the  effects  of  short-term  volatility  in  the  market  value  of 
investments over a fifteen-year period.  PERS unfunded actuarial accrued liability (or surplus) is being 
amortized as a level percentage of projected payroll on a closed basis.  The average amortization period 
for current service unfunded liability at June 30, 2006 was 30 years.

The  District  provides  dental  benefits  to  employees  who  retired  after  July  1,  1984,  and  to  their  eligible 
dependents at the same cost as for active employees.  Union employees hired after April 1, 1984 must have 
at least 10 years of service and be at minimum age 50 at retirement to receive this benefit.  Employees hired 
after April 1, 1988 must have 15 years of service and be at minimum age 50 at retirement to receive this 
benefit.  MCP employees hired after August 1, 2002, must have 15 years of service with the District and be 
at minimum age 50 at retirement in order to receive this retiree benefit. 
 
The  District  provides  health  care  benefits  as  described  above  for  the  surviving  spouse  and  eligible 
dependents  of  a  retiree  so  long  as  they  meet  the  eligibility  requirements.    The  District  provides  life 
insurance at a flat $2,000 benefit for union retirees and a flat $4,000 benefit for other retirees. 
 
A total of 164 and 152 retirees participated in the plan as of June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The cost of

employment health care and life insurance benefits. 
 
 
14.  LITIGATION 
 
In the normal course of business, the District is a defendant in various lawsuits.  Defense of the lawsuits is 
being  handled  by  the  District’s  insurance  carriers  and  losses,  if  any,  are  expected  to  be  covered  by 
insurance.  District officials are of the opinion that none of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect 
on the District’s financial position.

prevented or detected by the entity’s internal control.  We noted no matters involving the internal control 
over financial reporting and its operation that we consider to be material weaknesses. 
 
This  report  is  intended  for  the  information  of  management  and  federal  awarding  agencies  and  pass-
through entities.  However, this report is a matter of public record and its distribution is not limited.

APPENDIX D

INFORMATION ON THE DISTRICT’S SERVICE AREA

The Alameda County Water District covers approximately 100 square miles in
southwestern Alameda County. The District includes the City of Union City and most of the
incorporated boundaries of the City of Fremont and the City of Newark (collectively, the
“Cities”). The center of the District is located about 30 miles south of Oakland and 35 miles
southeast of San Francisco.

The District forms part of the highly urbanized and industrialized East Bay, which in turn
is part of the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. Two main line railroads serve the District.
Stations of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) are located at Fremont and Union City,
providing convenient transportation for District residents to points in Alameda, Contra Costa,
San Mateo and San Francisco Counties. Connecting bus lines serve Marin and Santa Clara
Counties from BART terminals.

The District’s economy is based largely on manufacturing and distribution. Access to
highly developed transportation facilities has resulted in the development of numerous
distribution plants. A number of nurseries, orchards and vegetable farms throughout the District
provide an agricultural base. The District has benefited from the rapid growth in southern
Alameda County, discussed in the following sections of this Appendix.

Population

The District serves virtually all of the developed areas of Fremont, Newark and Union
City. The combined population of these three Cities as of January 1, 2009 totaled 333,648,
according to estimates by the State Department of Finance.

City of Fremont

Located on the southeast side of the San Francisco Bay, Fremont is a city of over 215,000
people with an area of 92-square miles, making it the fourth most populous city in the Bay Area
and California’s fifth largest city in area.

The City of Fremont was incorporated January 23, 1956 as a general law city, combining
the former communities of Centerville, Irvington, Mission San Jose, Niles and Warm Springs
into one City. The City is named after General John G. Fremont.

Fremont has the council-manager form of government. The City Council, including four
Councilmembers and the Mayor, is elected by citizens of Fremont, adopts the City’s budget and
makes all major policy decisions. The City Council appoints a City Manager, who hires all City
staff and manages the day-to-day business of the City. Advisory bodies advise the City Council
and identify issues before the Council makes final decisions.

Fremont has extensive open space. The western quarter of the City is part of the San
Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, and the eastern quarter is located in virtually
undeveloped hills. There are 22 miles of San Francisco Bay shoreline within the City limits.
The 412-acre Central Park includes Lake Elizabeth and the Civic Center, which provide a unique
civic and recreational complex in the center of the City.

City of Newark

Situated in the west central part of the District, Newark has been a center of salt
production since 1852. Like the other two cities served by the District, Newark has a
well-developed industrial base. The City was incorporated September 22, 1955 and operates a
general law city under California statutes. It is located in the San Francisco East Bay Area, with
the cities of Fremont and Union City as neighbors.
The City’s current population is
approximately 44,000, with the workday population exceeding 100,000. The area encompassed
by the incorporated City of Newark is approximately 13 square miles.

The City employs the council-manager form of government, with four councilmen
elected at large to serve four-year overlapping terms. The Mayor is directly elected for a
two-year term.

Newark has

a diversified industrial-

are
several manufacturing plants in the community area. Leading manufacturers include computer

and retail-based economy.

There

D-8

network servers, semi-conductors, salt processing, glass products, food processing and electronic
components. Newark is home to one of Alameda County’s major shopping malls, NewPark
Mall, as well as an auto mall.

City of Union City

Union City is the site of the first successful beet sugar mill in the United States. The mill
closed in 1975 after 106 years of operation. Today Union City is a growing industrial and
residential city, and it is home to a growing number of retail outlets, including the highly popular
Union Landing Shopping Plaza, which is anchored by the Century 25 theater complex, one of the
top grossing multiplexes in the country.

Union City was incorporated January 13, 1959 as a general law city, combining the
former communities of Alvarado and Decoto, with a Council/Manager form of government. The
City Council consists of the mayor and four council members elected from the city at large,
rather than by district, each for four-year terms.

The City has a population of approximately 74,000 people. Within the City are 1,497
acres zoned for industry, including Union City-Alvarado Industrial Park, Central Bay Industrial
Park and Union City Industrial Park. Several manufacturing plants in the City produce a wide
variety of products, led by food processing and metal processing. The City is also an important
distribution center by virtue of its location on two main-line railroads, the heavily-traveled
Highway 880, and its proximity to the Hayward-San Mateo Bridge leading to the San Francisco
Peninsula.
It is 18 square miles in size and bounded by the City of Hayward to the north and
west and by the City of Fremont to the south and east.

PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL

[Closing Date]

Board of Directors
Alameda County Water District
Fremont, California

Alameda County Water District

2009 Water System Refunding Revenue Bonds

(Final Opinion)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Alameda County Water District (the
“District”) in connection with issuance of $26,340,000 aggregate principal amount of Alameda
County Water District 2009 Water System Refunding Revenue Bonds (the “Bonds”), issued
pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of October 1, 2009 (the “Indenture”), between the District and
U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Indenture, the Tax Certificate of the
District, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), opinions of counsel to the District and the
Trustee, certificates of the District, the Trustee and others, and such other documents, opinions
and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws,
regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such
authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after
the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any
such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention
after the date hereof. Accordingly, this opinion speaks only as of its date and is not intended to,
and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our
engagement with respect to the Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any
obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and
signatures presented to us (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and
delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than the District. We have assumed,
without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or
certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in
the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and
agreements contained in the Indenture and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation)
covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions,

E-1

omissions or events will not cause interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income for
federal income tax purposes. We call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under
the Bonds, the Indenture and the Tax Certificate and their enforceability may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and
other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to
the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies
against county water districts in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to
any indemnification, contribution, penalty, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue,
waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any
opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the assets described in
or as subject to the lien of the Indenture or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description
contained therein of, or the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such assets. Finally, we
undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement
or other offering material relating to the Bonds and express no opinion with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date

hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1.

The Bonds constitute valid and binding special obligations of the District,
and are payable solely from the Net Revenues (as that term is defined in the Indenture) and
certain other funds held under the Indenture.

2.

The Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes

the valid and binding obligation of, the District.

3.

Interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income
tax purposes under section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State
of California personal income taxes. Interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for
purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although we observe
that it is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum
taxable income. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the
ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.

Faithfully yours,

ORRICK, HERRINGTON & SUTCLIFFE LLP

APPENDIX F

BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM

DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be executed and
delivered as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership
nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One
fully-registered certificate will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds in the initial aggregate
principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.

DTC, the world’s largest depository, is a limited purpose trust company organized under
the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York
Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the
meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered
pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds
and provides asset servicing for over 2.2 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues,
corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments from over 100 countries that
DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade
settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited
securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct
Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates.
Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC, in turn, is owned
by a number of Direct Participants of DTC and Members of the National Securities Clearing
Corporation, Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, and Emerging Markets Clearing Corporation
(NSCC, FICC and EMCC, also subsidiaries of DTCC), as well as by the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange LLC and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-
U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly
(“Indirect Participants”). DTC has Standard & Poor’s highest rating: AAA. The DTC Rules
applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct
Participants, which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest
of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the
Direct and Indirect Participants’
receive written
confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive
written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their
holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into
the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries
made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners.
Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Bonds,
except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.

Beneficial Owners will not

records.

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC
are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee; Cede & Co. or such other name as

F-1

may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DTC and
their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any
change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the
Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such
Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect
Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their
customers.

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by
Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to
Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or
regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may
wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events
with respect to the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to
the Bond documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the
nominee holding the Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to
Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and
addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices be provided directly to them.

Redemption notices will be sent to DTC.

If less than all of the Bonds with a particular
stated maturity are being prepaid, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the
interest of each Direct Payment in such Bonds to be prepaid.

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with
respect to Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s Procedures.
Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the District as soon as possible
after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to
those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Bonds are credited on the record date (identified
in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).

Payments of principal, premium, if any, interest and other payments evidenced by the
Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized
representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s
receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the District or the Trustee on the
payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments
by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary
practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or
registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC nor
its nominee, the Trustee or the District, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as
may be in effect from time to time. Payments of principal, premium, if any, interest and other
payments evidenced by the Bonds to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by
an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of the District or the Trustee
disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and
disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and
Indirect Participants.

DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at

any time by giving reasonable notice to the District or the Trustee.

F-2

The District may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through

DTC (or a successor securities depository).

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been

the District

The District cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC Direct Participants or
Indirect Participants or others will distribute payments with respect to the Bonds received by
DTC or its nominee as the registered Owner, or any redemption or other notices, to the
Beneficial Owners, or that they will do so on a timely basis, or that DTC will service and act in
the manner described in this Official Statement.

The District and the Trustee cannot and do not give any assurances that DTC will
distribute to Participants, or that Participants or others will distribute payments of principal
interest or any premium with respect to the Bonds paid to DTC or its nominee as the registered
Owner, or any redemption or other notices, to the Beneficial Owners, or that they will do so on a
timely basis or will serve and act in the manner described in this Official Statement. The District
and the Trustee are not responsible or liable for the failure of DTC or any Participants to make
any payment or give any notice to a Beneficial Owner with respect to the Bonds or any error or
delay relating thereto.

The foregoing description of the procedures and record-keeping with respect to beneficial
ownership interests in the Bonds, payment of principal, interest and other payments with respect
to the Bonds to Participants or Beneficial Owners, confirmation and transfer of beneficial
ownership interests in such Bonds and other related transactions by and between DTC, the
Participants and the Beneficial Owners is based on information provided by DTC. Accordingly,
the District takes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness thereof. So long as the
Bonds are in book-entry only form, the references in the Official Statement to the Owners or the
registered Owners of the Bonds shall mean DTC, and not the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds.

Discontinuance of DTC Service. In the event that (a) DTC determines not to continue to
act as securities depository for the Bonds, or (b) the District determines to remove DTC from its
functions as a depository, DTC’s role as securities depository for the Bonds and use of the book-
entry system will be discontinued. If the District fails to select a qualified securities depository
to replace DTC, the District will cause the Trustee to execute and deliver new Bonds in fully
registered form in such denominations numbered in the manner determined by the Trustee and
registered in the names of such persons as are requested by the Beneficial Owners thereof. Upon
such registration, such persons in whose names the Bonds are registered will become the
registered Owners of the Bonds for all purposes.
