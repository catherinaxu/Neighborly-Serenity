information or to make any representations other than as contained in this Official Statement, and if given or made, 
such  other  information  or  representation  not  so  authorized  should  not  be  relied  upon  as  having  been  given  or 
authorized by the District. 

The  issuance  and  sale  of  the  Bonds  have  not  been  registered  under  the  Securities  Act  of  1933  or  the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, in reliance upon exemptions provided thereunder by Sections

constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy in any state in which such offer or solicitation is not 
authorized or in which the person making such offer or solicitation is not qualified to do so or to any person to 
whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation. 

Certain  information  set  forth  herein  has  been  obtained  from  sources  outside  of  the  District  which  are 
believed  to  be  reliable,  but  such  information  is  not  guaranteed  as  to  accuracy  or  completeness,  and  is  not  to  be 
construed  as  a  representation  by  the District.    The  information  and  expressions  of opinions herein  are  subject  to

hereof.  This Official Statement is submitted in connection with the sale of the Bonds referred to herein and may not 
be reproduced or used, in whole or in part, for any other purpose. 

When used in this Official Statement and in any continuing disclosure by the District in any press release

contemplated in such forward-looking statements.  Any forecast is subject to such uncertainties.  Inevitably, some 
assumptions  used  to  develop  the  forecasts  will  not  be  realized  and  unanticipated  events  and  circumstances  may 
occur.  Therefore, there are likely to be differences between forecasts and actual results, and those differences may 
be material.

INTRODUCTION 

This  Official  Statement,  which  includes  the  cover  page  and  appendices  hereto,  provides 
information  in  connection  with  the  sale  of  the  Bonita  Unified  School  District  (Los  Angeles  County, 
California) 2016 General Obligation Refunding Bonds (the “Bonds”). 

This Introduction is not a summary of this Official Statement. It is only a brief description of and 
guide  to,  and  is  qualified  by,  more  complete  and  detailed  information  contained  in  the  entire  Official 
Statement, including the cover page and appendices hereto, and the documents summarized or described 
herein.    A  full  review  should  be  made  of  the  entire  Official  Statement.    The  offering  of  the  Bonds  to 
potential investors is made only by means of the entire Official Statement.  

Changes Since the Preliminary Official Statement 

Since  the  publication  of  the  Preliminary  Official  Statement,  the  District  has  submitted  an 
application to the Internal Revenue Service for a New Clean Renewable Energy Bond allocation.  See 
“BONITA  UNIFIED  SCHOOL  DISTRICT  –  District  Debt  Structure  –  New  Clean  Renewable  Energy 
Bond” herein. 

General 

The  Bonita  Unified  School  District  (the  “District”)  was  formed  by  an  election  held  on 
December 10, 1957 to unify the former districts of La Verne Elementary, La Verne Heights Elementary, 
San Dimas Elementary and Bonita Union High.  The District encompasses an area of approximately 49 
square miles, including the cities of La Verne and San Dimas, and is located in the eastern portion of Los 
Angeles County (the “County”).  The District currently operates two comprehensive high schools, one 
continuation high school, one alternative school, two middle schools, and eight elementary schools.  For 
fiscal year 2015-16, taxable property within the District has an assessed valuation of $8,444,258,627 and 
the District’s average daily attendance (“ADA”) is projected to be 9,935 students. 

The District is governed by a five-member Board of Education (the “Board”), each member of 
which  is  elected  to  a  four-year  term.    Elections  for  positions  to  the  Board  are  held  every  two  years, 
alternating between two and three available positions.  The management and policies of the District are 
administered  by  a  Superintendent  appointed  by  the  Board  who  is  responsible  for  day-to-day  District 
operations as well as the supervision of the District’s other key personnel.  Kurt Madden is currently the 
District’s Superintendent.   

For  more  information  regarding  the  District  generally,  see  “BONITA  UNIFIED  SCHOOL 
DISTRICT,”  herein  and  for  more  information  regarding  the  District’s  assessed  valuation,  see  “TAX 
BASE FOR PAYMENT OF BONDS” herein.

Purpose of the Bonds 

The  Bonds  are  being  issued  to  (i)  advance  refund  the  District’s  outstanding  Election  of  2008 
General Obligation Bonds, Series B (the “2008 Series B Bonds”) and (ii) pay the costs of issuance of the 
Bonds.    The  2008  Series  B  Bonds  to  be  refunded  with  the  proceeds  of  the  Bonds  are  also  referred  to 
herein as the “Refunded Bonds.”  See “THE BONDS – Refunding Plan” and “ESTIMATED SOURCES 
AND USES OF FUNDS” herein. 

Authority for Issuance of the Bonds 

The Bonds are issued pursuant to certain provisions of the State of California Government Code 

and pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board.  See “THE BONDS – Authority for Issuance” herein. 

Sources of Payment for the Bonds 

The Bonds are general obligations of the District payable solely from the proceeds of ad valorem 
property taxes.  The Board of Supervisors of the County is empowered and obligated to annually levy ad 
valorem taxes, without limitation as to rate or amount (except certain personal property which is taxable 
at limited rates), upon all property subject to taxation by the District, for the payment of the principal of 
and interest on the Bonds when due.  See “THE BONDS – Security and Sources of Payment” and “TAX 
BASE FOR PAYMENT OF BONDS” herein. 

Description of the Bonds 

Form  and  Registration.    The  Bonds  will  be  issued  in  fully  registered  book-entry  form  only, 
without coupons.  The Bonds will be initially registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The 
Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”).  DTC will act as securities depository for 
the Bonds.  See “THE BONDS – General Provisions” and “THE BONDS – Book-Entry Only System” 
herein.    Purchasers  of  the  Bonds  (the  “Beneficial  Owners”)  will  not  receive  physical  certificates 
representing  their  interests  in  the  Bonds  purchased.    In  the  event  that  the  book-entry  only  system 
described below is no longer used with respect to the Bonds, the Bonds will be registered in accordance 
with  the  Resolution  (as  defined  herein).    See  “THE  BONDS  –  Discontinuation  of  Book-Entry  Only 
System; Payment to Beneficial Owners” herein. 

So long as Cede & Co. is the registered owner of the Bonds, as nominee of DTC, references 
herein to the “Owners,” “Bondowners” or “Holders” of the Bonds (other than under the caption 
“TAX MATTERS” herein and in APPENDIX A hereto) will mean Cede & Co. and will not mean 
the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds. 

Denominations.  Individual purchases of interests in the Bonds will be available to purchasers of 

the Bonds in the denominations of $5,000 principal amount, or any integral multiple thereof.   

Redemption.   The Bonds maturing on or after August 1, 2026 are subject to redemption prior to 
their stated maturity dates, at the option of the District, from any source of funds, on August 1, 2025, or 
on any date thereafter, as a whole or in part.  See “THE BONDS – Redemption” herein. 

Payments.    The  Bonds  will  be  dated  as  of  the  date  of  their  initial  delivery  (the  “Date  of 
Delivery”).  Interest on the Bonds accrues from the Date of Delivery, and is payable semiannually on 
each February 1 and August 1 (each a “Bond Payment Date”), commencing August 1, 2016.  Principal of 
the  Bonds  is  payable  on  August  1  in  the  amounts  and  years  as  set  forth  on  the  cover  page  hereof.  
Payments  of  the  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  will  be  made  by  the  designated  paying  agent, 

 
 

 2 

 

registrar  and  transfer  agent  (the  “Paying  Agent”)  to  DTC  for  subsequent  disbursement  through  DTC 
Participants (as defined herein) to the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds.  U.S. Bank National Association, 
Los Angeles, California, has been appointed as agent of the Treasurer and Tax Collector of the County 
(the “Treasurer”) to act as Paying Agent for the Bonds. 

Tax Matters 

In the opinion of Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth, a Professional Corporation, San Francisco, 
California (“Bond Counsel”), based on existing statutes, regulations, rulings and judicial decisions and 
assuming the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants and requirements 
described herein, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes 
and  is  not  an  item  of  tax  preference  for  purposes  of  calculating  the  federal  alternative  minimum  tax 
imposed on individuals and corporations.  In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is 
exempt from State of California (the “State”) personal income tax.  In addition, the difference between the 
issue price of a Bond (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Bonds of a maturity is to be sold 
to the public) and the stated redemption price at maturity with respect to the Bond constitutes original 
issue  discount,  and  the  amount  of  original  issue  discount  that  accrues  to  the  owner  of  the  Bond  is

Authority for Issuance 

THE BONDS 

The Bonds are issued pursuant to the provisions of Articles 9 and 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of 
Division  2  of  the  State  Government  Code  (the  “Act”)  and  other  applicable  law,  and  pursuant  to  a 
resolution adopted by the Board on May 6, 2015 (the “Resolution”). 

Security and Sources of Payment 

The Bonds are general obligations of the District, payable solely from the proceeds of ad valorem 
property taxes.  The Board of Supervisors of the County is empowered and obligated to annually levy ad 
valorem property taxes upon all property within the District subject to taxation thereby, without limitation 
as to rate or amount (except certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates), for the payment 
of the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due.  The levy may include an allowance for an annual 
reserve,  established  for  the  purpose  of  avoiding  fluctuating  tax  levies.    The  County,  however,  is  not 
obligated to establish such a reserve, and the District can make no representation that such reserve will be 
established  by  the  County  or  that  such  a  reserve,  if  previously  established  by  the  County,  will  be 
maintained in the future. 

Pursuant  to  Section  53515  of  the  State  Government  Code,  the  Bonds  will  be  secured  by  a 
statutory  lien  on  all  revenues  received  pursuant  to  the  levy  and  collection  of  the  above-described  ad 
valorem property tax.  The lien will automatically attach, without further action or authorization by the 
Board, and will be valid and binding from the time the Bonds are executed and delivered at Closing.  The 
revenues received pursuant to the levy and collection of the ad valorem property tax will be immediately 
subject to the lien, and such lien will be enforceable against the District, its successor, transferees and 
creditors, and all other parties asserting rights therein, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of 
the lien and without the need for physical delivery, recordation, filing or further act.   

Such taxes will be levied annually in addition to all other taxes during the period that the Bonds 
are outstanding in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due.  Such 
taxes, when collected, will be placed by the County in the “Bonita Unified School District 2016 General 
Obligation  Refunding  Bonds  Debt  Service  Fund”  (the  “Debt  Service  Fund”),  which  is  segregated  and 
maintained by the County and which has been designated for the payment of the principal of and interest 
on the Bonds when due, and for no other purpose.  Pursuant to the Resolution, the District has pledged 
amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Fund to the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds, 
and for no other purpose.  Although the County is obligated to levy ad valorem property taxes for the 
payment of the Bonds, and will maintain the Debt Service Fund pledged to the repayment of the Bonds, 
the Bonds are not a debt of the County. 

 
 

 5 

 

The moneys in the Debt Service Fund, to the extent necessary to pay the principal of and interest 
on the Bonds as the same become due and payable, will be transferred by the County to the Paying Agent.  
The Paying Agent will in turn remit the funds to DTC for remittance of such principal and interest to its 
Participants for subsequent disbursement to the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds.   

The rate of the annual ad valorem property taxes levied by the County to repay the Bonds will be 
determined by the relationship between the assessed valuation of taxable property in the District and the 
amount of debt service due on the Bonds in any year.  Fluctuations in the annual debt service due on the 
Bonds and the assessed valuation of taxable property in the District  may cause the annual tax rates to 
fluctuate.  Economic and other factors beyond the District’s control, such as general market decline in 
land values, disruption in financial markets that may reduce the availability of financing for purchasers of 
property, reclassification of property to a class exempt from taxation, whether by ownership or use (such 
as  exemptions  for  property  owned  by  the  State  and  local  agencies  and  property  used  for  qualified 
education, hospital, charitable or religious purposes), or the complete or partial destruction of the taxable 
property  caused  by  a  natural  or  manmade  disaster,  such  as  earthquake,  drought,  flood  or  toxic 
contamination, could cause a reduction in the assessed valuation of taxable property within the District 
and  necessitate  a  corresponding  increase  in  the  respective  annual  tax  rates.    For  further  information 
regarding  the  District’s  assessed  valuation,  tax  rates,  overlapping  debt,  and  other  matters  concerning 
taxation,  see  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT 
REVENUES  AND  APPROPRIATIONS  –  Article  XIIIA  of  the  California  Constitution”  and  “TAX 
BASE FOR PAYMENT OF BONDS – Assessed Valuations” herein. 

General Provisions 

The Bonds will be issued in book-entry form only, and will be initially issued and registered in 
the  name  of  Cede &  Co.,  as  nominee  for  DTC.    Purchasers  will  not  receive  physical  certificates 
representing their interests in the Bonds.  The Bonds will be dated as of the Date of Delivery.   

Interest on the Bonds accrues from the Date of Delivery, and is payable semiannually on each 
Bond Payment Date, commencing August 1, 2016.  Interest on the Bonds will be computed on the basis 
of a 360-day year of 12, 30-day months.  Each Bond will bear interest from the Bond Payment Date next 
preceding the date of authentication thereof unless it is authenticated as of a day during the period from 
the 16th day of the month next preceding any Bond Payment Date to that Bond Payment Date, inclusive, 
in  which  event  it  will  bear  interest  from  such  Bond  Payment  Date,  or  unless  it  is  authenticated  on  or 
before  July  15,  2016,  in  which  event  it  will  bear  interest  from  the  Date  of  Delivery.    The  Bonds  are 
issuable in denominations of $5,000 principal amount or any integral multiple thereof.  The Bonds mature 
on August 1, in the years and amounts set forth on the cover page hereof. 

Payment  of  interest  will  be  made  on  any  Bond  Payment  Date  to  the  person  appearing  on  the 
registration books of the Paying Agent as the registered Owner thereof as of the close of business on the 
15th day of the month next preceding any Bond Payment Date (a “Record Date”), such interest to be paid 
by check mailed to such Bond Owner on the Bond Payment Date at his or her address as it appears on 
such registration books or at such other address as he or she may have filed with the Paying Agent for that 
purpose on or before the Record Date.  The Bond Owner in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 
or  more  may  request  in  writing  to  the  Paying  Agent  that  such  Bond  Owner  be  paid  interest  by  wire 
transfer  to  the  bank  and  account  number  on  file  with  the  Paying  Agent  as  of  the  Record  Date.    The 
principal of and redemption premium, if any, payable on the Bonds shall be payable upon maturity or 
redemption upon surrender at the designated office of the Paying Agent.  The principal of, premiums, if 
any, and interest on the Bonds will be payable in lawful money of the United States of America.

See “BONITA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT – District Debt Structure – General Obligation 
Bonds” for a complete debt service schedule of all of the District’s outstanding general obligation bonded 
debt. 

Refunding Plan 

The Bonds are being issued to (i) advance refund the Refunded Bonds and (ii) pay the costs of 

issuance of the Bonds.   

Escrow Fund.  The net proceeds from the sale of the Bonds will be deposited with U.S. Bank 
National Association, acting as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), to the credit of the “Bonita Unified 
School  District  2016  General  Obligation  Refunding  Bonds  Escrow  Fund”  (the  “Escrow  Fund”) 
established pursuant to an escrow agreement relating to the Refunded Bonds (the “Escrow Agreement”) 
by  and  between  the  District  and  the  Escrow  Agent.    Pursuant  to  the  Escrow  Agreement,  the  amount 
deposited  in  the  Escrow  Fund  will  be  used  to  purchase  certain  Federal  Securities  (as  defined  in  the 
Resolution), the principal of and interest on which will be sufficient, together with any monies deposited 
in  the  Escrow  Fund  and  held  as  cash,  to  enable  the  Escrow  Agent  to  pay  redemption  price  of  the 
Refunded Bonds on August 1, 2021, the first optional redemption date therefor, as well as interest due 
thereon on and before such date. 

 
 

 7 

 

Escrow  Verification.  The  sufficiency  of  the  amounts  on  deposit  in  the  Escrow  Fund,  together 
with realizable interest and earnings thereon, if any, to pay the principal of and interest on or Accreted 
Value of the Refunded Bonds, as described above, will be verified by the Verification Agent.  As a result 
of the deposit and application of funds so provided in the Escrow Agreement, and assuming the accuracy 
of the Underwriter’s and Verification Agent’s computations, the Refunded Bonds will be defeased and 
the obligation of the County to levy ad valorem property taxes for payment of the Refunded Bonds will 
terminate.  See “LEGAL MATTERS – Escrow Verification” herein. 

Debt Service Fund.  The accrued interest and surplus moneys in the Escrow Fund, when received 
by the District from the sale of the Bonds or following the redemption of the Refunded Bonds, shall be 
kept  separate  and  apart  in  the  Debt  Service  Fund  and  used  only  for  payment  of  the  principal  of  and 
interest  on  the  Bonds.    Any  excess  proceeds  of  the  Bonds  not  needed  for  the  authorized  purposes  for 
which the Bonds are being issued will be transferred to the Debt Service Fund and applied to the payment 
of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds.    If,  after  payment  in  full  of  the  Bonds,  there  remain  excess 
proceeds, any such excess amounts shall be transferred to the general fund of the District. 

Moneys  in  the  Debt  Service  Fund  are  expected  to  be  invested  through  the  County’s  pooled 
investment  fund.    See  “APPENDIX  E  –  LOS  ANGELES  COUNTY  TREASURY  POOL”  attached 
hereto. 

Redemption 

Optional  Redemption.    The  Bonds  maturing  on  or  before  August  1,  2025  are  not  subject  to 
redemption prior to their respective maturity dates.  The Bonds maturing on or after August 1, 2026 are 
subject to redemption prior to their respective stated maturity dates at the option of the District, from any 
source of available funds, as a whole or in part, on any date on or after August 1, 2025, at a redemption 
price  equal  to  the  principal  amount  of  the  Bonds  called  for  redemption,  together  with  interest  accrued 
thereon to the date fixed for redemption, without premium. 

Selection of Bonds for Redemption.  Whenever provision is made for the optional redemption of 
Bonds and less than all outstanding Bonds are to be redeemed, the Paying Agent, upon written instruction 
from the District, will select Bonds for redemption as so directed by the District, and if not directed, in 
inverse  order  of  maturity.    Within  a  maturity,  the  Paying  Agent  will  select  Bonds  for  redemption  as 
directed by the District, and if not so directed, by lot.  Redemption by lot will be in such manner as the 
Paying Agent will determine; provided, however, that the portion of any Bond to be redeemed in part will 
be in a principal amount of $5,000, or any integral multiple thereof. 

Notice  of  Redemption.    When  optional  redemption  is  authorized  or  required  pursuant  to  the 
Resolution, the Paying Agent, upon written instruction from the District, will give notice (a “Redemption 
Notice”)  of  the  redemption  of  the  Bonds.    Such  Redemption  Notice  will  specify  (a)  the  Bonds  or 
designated portions thereof (in the case of redemption of the Bonds in part but not in whole) which are to 
be  redeemed,  (b)  the  date  of  redemption,  (c)  the  place  or  places  where  the  redemption  will  be  made, 
including the name and address of the Paying Agent, (d) the redemption price, (e) the CUSIP numbers (if 
any) assigned to the Bonds to be redeemed, (f) the Bond numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed in whole 
or in part and, in the case of any Bond to be redeemed in part only, the principal amount of such Bond to 
be redeemed, and (g) the original issue date, interest rate and stated  maturity date of each  Bond to be 
redeemed in whole or in part.   

The Paying Agent will take the following actions with respect to each such Redemption Notice: 
(a) at least 20 but not more than 45 days prior to the redemption date, such Redemption Notice will be 
given  to  the  respective  Owners  of  Bonds  designated  for  redemption  by  registered  or  certified  mail, 

 
 

 8 

 

postage prepaid, at their addresses appearing on the bond register; (b) at least 20 but not more than 45 
days  prior  to  the  redemption  date,  such  Redemption Notice  will  be  given  by  (i)  registered  or  certified 
mail,  postage  prepaid,  (ii)  telephonically  confirmed  facsimile  transmission,  or  (iii)  overnight  delivery 
service, to the Securities Depository; (c) at least 20 but not more than 45 days prior to the redemption 
date,  such  Redemption  Notice  will  be  given by  (i)  registered  or  certified  mail,  postage  prepaid,  or  (ii) 
overnight delivery service, to one of the Information Services; and (d) provide such Redemption Notice to 
such other persons as may otherwise be required pursuant to the Continuing Disclosure Certificate. 

“Information  Services”  means  Financial  Information,  Inc.’s  “Daily  Called  Bond  Service,”  1 
Cragwood  Road,  2nd  Floor,  South  Plainfield,  New  Jersey  07080,  Attention:  Editor;  Mergent  Inc.,  585

“Securities Depository” shall mean The Depository Trust Company, 55 Water Street, New York, 

New York 10041. 

A  certificate  of  the  Paying  Agent  or  the  District  that  a  Redemption  Notice  has  been  given  as 
provided  in  the  Resolution  will  be  conclusive  as  against  all  parties.    Neither  failure  to  receive  any 
Redemption Notice nor any defect in any such Redemption Notice so given will affect the sufficiency of 
the proceedings for the redemption of the affected Bonds.  Each check issued or other transfer of funds 
made by the Paying Agent for the purpose of redeeming Bonds will bear or include the CUSIP number, if 
any, identifying, by issue and maturity, the Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such check or 
other transfer.    Such Redemption Notice may state that no representation is made as to the accuracy or 
correctness of CUSIP numbers printed thereon, or on the Bonds. 

Partial  Redemption  of  Bonds.    Upon  the  surrender  of  any  Bond  redeemed  in  part  only,  the 
Paying  Agent  will  execute  and  deliver  to  the  Owner  thereof  a  new  Bond  or  Bonds  of  like  tenor  and 
maturity and of authorized denominations equal in principal amounts to the unredeemed portion of the 
Bond surrendered.  Such partial redemption is valid upon payment of the amount required to be paid to 
such Owner, and the District will be released and discharged thereupon from all liability to the extent of 
such payment. 

Effect of Notice of Redemption.  Notice having been given as described above, and the moneys 
for the redemption (including the interest accrued to the applicable date of redemption) having been set 
aside as described in “- Defeasance” herein, the Bonds to be redeemed will become due and payable on 
such date of redemption. 

If, on such redemption date, moneys for the redemption of all the Bonds to be redeemed, together 
with interest accrued to such redemption date, will be held in trust as described in “- Defeasance” herein 
so as to be available therefor on such redemption date, and if a Redemption Notice thereof will have been 
given as described above, then from and after such redemption date, interest on the Bonds to be redeemed 
will cease to accrue and become payable.  All money held for the redemption of the Bonds shall be held 
in trust for the account of the Owners of the Bonds so to be redeemed. 

Rescission of Notice of Redemption.  With respect to any Redemption Notice in connection with 
the optional redemption of Bonds (or portions thereof) as described above, unless upon the giving of such 
notice  such  Bonds  or  portions  thereof  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  defeased  as  described  in 
“- Defeasance” herein, such Redemption Notice will state that such redemption will be conditional upon 
the receipt by an independent escrow agent selected by the District, on or prior to the date fixed for such 
redemption,  of  the  moneys  necessary  and  sufficient  to  pay  the  principal  of,  and  premium,  if  any,  and 

 
 

 9 

 

interest on, such Bonds (or portions thereof) to be redeemed, and that if such moneys shall not have been 
so received said Redemption Notice will be of no force and effect, no portion of the Bonds will be subject 
to redemption on such date and such Bonds will not be required to be redeemed on such date.  In the 
event that such Redemption Notice contains such a condition and such moneys are not so received, the 
redemption will not be made and the Paying Agent will within a reasonable time thereafter (but in no 
event  later  than  the  date  originally  set  for  redemption)  give  notice  to  the  persons  to  whom  and  in  the 
manner in which the Redemption Notice was given that such moneys were not so received.  In addition, 
the District will have the right to rescind any Redemption Notice, by written notice to the Paying Agent, 
on  or  prior  to  the  date  fixed  for  such  redemption.    The  Paying  Agent  will  distribute  a  notice  of  the 
rescission of such Redemption Notice in the same manner as such notice was originally provided. 

Bonds No Longer Outstanding.  When any Bonds (or portions thereof), which have been duly 
called for redemption prior to maturity under the provisions of the Resolution, or with respect to which 
irrevocable instructions to call for redemption prior to maturity at the earliest redemption date have been 
given to the Paying Agent, in form satisfactory to it, and sufficient moneys shall be held irrevocably in 
trust  for  the  payment  of  the  redemption  price  of  such  Bonds  or  portions  thereof,  and,  accrued  interest 
thereon to the date fixed for redemption, all as provided in the Resolution, then such Bonds will no longer 
be deemed outstanding and will be surrendered to the Paying Agent for cancellation. 

Book-Entry Only System 

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained 
from  sources  that  the  District  believes  to  be  reliable,  but  the  District  takes  no  responsibility  for  the 
accuracy or completeness thereof.  The District cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC or 
DTC Participants will distribute to the Beneficial Owners (a) payments of interest, principal or premium, 
if any, with respect to the Bonds, (b) certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation 
or ownership interest in the Bonds, or (c) redemption or other notices sent to DTC or Cede & Co., its 
nominee, as the registered owner of the Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis or that DTC or 
DTC  Participants  will  act  in  the  manner  described  in  this  Official  Statement.    The  current  “Rules” 
applicable  to  DTC  are  on  file  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  and  the  current 
“Procedures” of DTC to be followed in dealing with the Participants are on file with DTC. 

The  DTC,  New  York,  NY,  will  act  as  securities  depository  for  the  Bonds.  The  Bonds  will  be 
issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or 
such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond 
certificate will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such 
maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.   

DTC,  the  world’s  largest  securities  depository,  is  a  limited-purpose  trust  company  organized 
under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking 
Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the  meaning of the New 
York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 
17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.6 million 
issues  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  equity  issues,  corporate  and  municipal  debt  issues,  and  money  market 
instruments  (from  over  100  countries)  that  DTC’s  participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC.  
DTC  also  facilitates  the  post-trade  settlement  among  Direct  Participants  of  sales  and  other  securities 
transactions  in  deposited  securities,  through  electronic  computerized  book-entry  transfers  and  pledges 
between  Direct  Participants’  accounts.    This  eliminates  the  need  for  physical  movement  of  securities 
certificates.  Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust 
companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations.  DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
The  Depository  Trust  &  Clearing  Corporation  (“DTCC”).    DTCC  is  the  holding  company  for  DTC, 

 
 

 10 

 

National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered 
clearing agencies.  DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries.  Access to the DTC system 
is  also  available  to  others  such  as  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  securities  brokers  and  dealers,  banks,  trust 
companies,  and  clearing  corporations  that  clear  through  or  maintain  a  custodial  relationship  with  a  Direct 
Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).  DTC is rated “AA+” by Standard & Poor’s.  
The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.  However, the information presented on 
such website is not incorporated herein by reference. 

Purchases  of  Bonds  under  the  DTC  system  must  be  made  by  or  through  Direct  Participants, 
which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each Beneficial 
Owner is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will 
not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase.  Beneficial Owners are, however, expected 
to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their 
holdings,  from  the  Direct  or  Indirect  Participant  through  which  the  Beneficial  Owner  entered  into  the 
transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the 
books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will 
not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the Bonds, except in the event that use of 
the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.  

To  facilitate  subsequent  transfers,  all  Bonds  deposited  by  Direct  Participants  with  DTC  are 
registered  in  the  name  of  DTC’s  partnership  nominee,  Cede  &  Co.,  or  such  other  name  as  may  be 
requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration 
in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. 
DTC has no  knowledge of the actual  Beneficial Owners of the  Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the 
identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be 
the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account 
of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 

Conveyance  of  notices  and  other  communications  by  DTC  to  Direct  Participants,  by  Direct 
Participants  to  Indirect  Participants,  and  by  Direct  Participants  and  Indirect  Participants  to  Beneficial 
Owners  will  be  governed  by  arrangements  among  them,  subject  to  any  statutory  or  regulatory 
requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take certain 
steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Bonds, such 
as redemptions, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Resolution.  For example, Beneficial Owners 
of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain 
and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners.  In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide 
their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices be provided directly to them 

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within an issue are being 
redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in 
such issue to be redeemed. 

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to 
Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under its 
usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the District as soon as possible after the record date. 
The  Omnibus  Proxy  assigns  Cede  &  Co.’s  consenting  or  voting  rights  to  those  Direct  Participants  to 
whose  accounts  Bonds  are  credited  on  the  record  date  (identified  in  a  listing  attached  to  the  Omnibus 
Proxy).  

 
 

 11 

 

Redemption proceeds and distributions on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other 
nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct 
Participants’ accounts  upon  DTC’s  receipt  of  funds  and  corresponding  detail  information  from  the 
District  or  the  Paying  Agent,  on  payable  date  in  accordance  with  their  respective  holdings  shown  on 
DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions 
and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or 
registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, the Paying 
Agent, or the District, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to 
time. Payment of redemption proceeds or distributions to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be 
requested  by  an  authorized  representative  of  DTC)  is  the  responsibility  of  the  District  or  the  Paying 
Agent,  disbursement  of  such  payments  to  Direct  Participants  will  be  the  responsibility  of  DTC,  and 
disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect 
Participants. 

DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at any time 
by giving reasonable notice to the District or the Paying Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event 
that a successor depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered. 

The  District  may  decide  to  discontinue  use  of  the  system  of  book-entry-only transfers  through 
DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and delivered 
to DTC. 

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained 
from  sources  that  the  District  believes  to  be  reliable,  but  the  District  takes  no  responsibility  for  the 
accuracy thereof. 

Discontinuation of Book-Entry Only System; Payment to Beneficial Owners 

So  long  as  any  of  the  Bonds  remain  outstanding,  the  District  will  cause  the  Paying  Agent  to 
maintain  at  its  designated  office  all  books  and  records  necessary  for  the  registration,  exchange  and 
transfer  of  such  Bonds,  which  will  at  all  times  be  open  to  inspection  by  the  District,  and,  upon 
presentation  for  such  purpose,  the  Paying  Agent  will,  under  such  reasonable  regulations  as  it  may 
prescribe, register, exchange or transfer or cause to be registered, exchanged or transferred, on said books, 
Bonds as provided in the Resolution. 

In  the  event  that  the  book-entry  system  described  above  is  no  longer  used  with  respect  to  the 
Bonds,  the  following  provisions  will  govern  the  payment,  registration,  transfer,  exchange  and 
replacement of the Bonds. 

The principal of the Bonds and any premium and interest upon the redemption thereof will be 
payable in lawful money of the United States of America upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at 
the designated office of the Paying Agent.  Interest on the Bonds will be paid by the Paying Agent by 
check or draft mailed to the person whose name appears on the registration books of the Paying Agent as 
the registered Owner, and to that person’s address appearing on the registration books as of the close of 
business on the Record Date.  At the written request of any registered Owner of at least $1,000,000 in 
aggregate principal amount, interest shall be wired to a bank and account number on file with the Paying 
Agent as of the Record Date. 

Any Bond may be exchanged for a Bond of like tenor, series, maturity and principal amount upon 
presentation  and  surrender  at  the  designated  office  of  the  Paying  Agent,  together  with  a  request  for 
exchange signed by the registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory 

 
 

 12 

 

to the Paying Agent.  A Bond may be transferred on the registration books of the Paying Agent only upon 
presentation and surrender of such Bond at the designated office of the Paying Agent together with an 
assignment executed by the Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the 
Paying Agent.  Upon such exchange or transfer, the Paying Agent will register, authenticate and deliver a 
new Bond or Bonds of like tenor and of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by the 
Owner equal to the principal amount of the Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the same rate and 
maturing on the same date. 

Neither  the  District  nor  the  Paying  Agent  will  be  required  to  (a)  issue  or  transfer  any  Bonds 
during a period beginning with the opening of business on the 16th day next preceding either any Bond 
Payment Date or any date of selection of Bonds to be redeemed and ending with the close of business on 
the Bond Payment Date, or any day on which the applicable Redemption Notice is given or (b) transfer 
any Bonds which have been selected or called for redemption in whole or in part. 

Defeasance 

All or any portion of the outstanding maturities of the Bonds may be defeased at any time prior to 

maturity in the following ways: 

(a) 

(b) 

Cash:    by  irrevocably  depositing  with  an  independent  escrow  agent  selected  by  the 
District  an  amount  of  cash  which,  together  with  amounts  transferred  from  the  Debt 
Service  Fund,  if  any,  is  sufficient  to  pay  all  Bonds  outstanding  and  designated  for 
defeasance  (including  all  principal  thereof,  accrued  interest  thereon  and  redemption 
premiums, if any) at or before their maturity date; or 

Government Obligations:  by irrevocably depositing with an independent escrow agent 
selected  by  the  District  noncallable  Government  Obligations  together  with  cash  and 
amounts transferred from the Debt Service Fund, if any, in such amount as will, together 
with  interest  to  accrue  thereon,  in  the  opinion  of  an  independent  certified  public 
accountant, be fully sufficient to pay and discharge all Bonds outstanding and designated 
for defeasance (including all principal thereof, accrued interest thereon and redemption 
premiums, if any) at or before their maturity date; 

then, notwithstanding that any of such Bonds shall not have been surrendered for payment, all obligations 
of the District with respect to all such designated outstanding Bonds shall cease and terminate, except 
only the obligation of the Paying Agent or an independent escrow agent selected by the District to pay or 
cause  to  be  paid  from  funds  deposited  pursuant  to  paragraphs  (a)  or  (b)  above,  to  the  owners  of  such 
designated Bonds not so surrendered and paid all sums due with respect thereto. 

“Government Obligations” means direct and general obligations of the United States of America, 
or  obligations  that  are  unconditionally  guaranteed  as  to  principal  and  interest  by  the  United  States  of 
America (which may consist of obligations of the Resolution Funding Corporation that constitute interest 
strips).    In  the  case  of  direct  and  general  obligations  of  the  United  States  of  America,  Government 
Obligations  shall  include  evidences  of  direct  ownership  of  proportionate  interests  in  future  interest  or 
principal payments of such obligations.  Investments in such proportionate interests must be limited to 
circumstances where (a) a bank or trust company acts as custodian and holds the underlying United States 
obligations;  (b)  the  owner  of  the  investment  is  the  real  party  in  interest  and  has  the  right  to  proceed 
directly  and  individually  against  the  obligor  of  the  underlying  United  States  obligations;  and  (c)  the 
underlying  United  States  obligations  are  held  in  a  special  account,  segregated  from  the  custodian’s 
general assets, and are not available to satisfy any claim of the custodian, any person claiming through the 
custodian,  or  any  person  to  whom  the  custodian  may  be  obligated;  provided  that  such  obligations  are 

 
 

 13 

 

rated or assessed at least  as high as direct and general obligations of the United States of  America by 
Moody’s  Investors  Service  (“Moody’s”)  or  Standard  &  Poor’s  Ratings  Services,  a  Standard  &  Poor’s 
Financial Services LLC business (“S&P”).

TAX BASE FOR PAYMENT OF BONDS 

The information in this section describes ad valorem property taxation, assessed valuation, and 
other measures of the tax base of the District.  The principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable 
solely from the proceeds of ad valorem taxes levied and collected by the County on taxable property in the 
District.  The District’s general fund is not a source for the repayment of the Bonds. 
Ad Valorem Property Taxation 

District property taxes are assessed and collected by the County at the same time and on the same 
tax rolls as County, city and special district property taxes.  Assessed valuations are the same for both 
District and County taxing purposes. 

Taxes are levied for each fiscal year on taxable real and personal property which is located in the 
District  as  of  the  preceding  January  1.    For  assessment  and  collection  purposes,  property  is  classified 
either as “secured” or “unsecured” and is listed accordingly on separate parts of the assessment roll.  The 
“secured roll” is that part of the assessment roll containing State assessed public utilities property and real 
property having a tax lien which is sufficient, in the opinion of the assessor, to secure payment of the 
taxes.    Other  property  is  assessed  on  the  “unsecured  roll.”    A  supplemental  roll  is  developed  when 
property changes hands or new construction is completed.  The County levies and collects all property 
taxes for property falling within the County’s taxing boundaries. 

The valuation of secured property is established as of January 1 and is subsequently equalized in 
August.  Property taxes on the secured roll are due in two installments, November 1 and February 1 of the 
fiscal year.  If unpaid, such taxes become delinquent after December 10 and April 10, respectively, and a 
10% penalty attaches to any delinquent installment, plus a minimum $10 cost on the second installment 
plus any additional amount determined by the Treasurer.  Property on the secured roll with delinquent 
taxes is declared tax-defaulted on or about June 30 of the fiscal year.  Such property may thereafter be 
redeemed  by  payment  of  the  delinquent  taxes  and  the  delinquency  penalty,  plus  a  minimum  $15 
redemption  fee  and  a  redemption  penalty  of  1.5%  per  month  to  the  time  of  redemption.    If  taxes  are 
unpaid for a period of five years or more, the property is then subject to sale by the Treasurer.   

 
 

 14 

 

Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due as of the January 1 lien date and become delinquent 
if they are not paid by August 31.  In the case of unsecured property taxes, a 10% penalty attaches to 
delinquent taxes on property on the unsecured roll, and an additional penalty of 1.5% per month begins to 
accrue beginning November 1 of the fiscal year, and a lien may be recorded against the assessee.  The 
taxing authority has four ways of collecting unsecured personal property taxes: (1) a civil action against 
the assessee; (2) filing a certificate in the office of the County Clerk specifying certain facts in order to 
obtain  a  judgment  lien  on  specific  property  of  the  assessee;  (3)  filing  a  certificate  of  delinquency  for 
record in the County Recorder’s office in order to obtain a lien on specified property of the assessee; and 
(4) seizure and sale of personal property, improvements or possessory interests belonging or assessed to 
the assessee.  See also “— Secured Tax Charges and Delinquencies” herein. 

State law exempts from taxation $7,000 of the full cash value of an owner-occupied dwelling, but 
this exemption does not result in any loss of revenue to local agencies, since the State reimburses local 
agencies for the value of the exemptions.   

All  property  is  assessed  using  full  cash  value  as  defined  by  Article  XIIIA  of  the  State 
Constitution.    State  law  provides  exemptions  from  ad  valorem  property  taxation  for  certain  classes  of 
property such as churches, colleges, non-profit hospitals, and charitable institutions. 

Assessed  valuation  growth  allowed  under  Article  XIIIA  (new  construction,  certain  changes  of 
ownership, 2% inflation) is allocated on the basis of “situs” among the jurisdictions that serve the tax rate 
area  within  which  the  growth  occurs.    Local  agencies,  including  school  districts,  share  the  growth  of 
“base” revenues from the tax rate  area.  Each year’s growth allocation becomes part of each agency’s 
allocation in the following year.

Economic  and  other  factors  beyond  the  District’s  control,  such  as  general  market  decline  in 
property values, disruption in financial markets that may reduce availability of financing for purchasers of 
property, reclassification of property to a class exempt from taxation, whether by ownership or use (such 
as  exemptions  for  property  owned  by  the  State  and  local  agencies  and  property  used  for  qualified 
education, hospital, charitable or religious purposes), or the complete or partial destruction of the taxable 
property  caused  by  a  natural  or  manmade  disaster,  such  as  earthquake,  drought,  flood,  fire  or  toxic 
contamination, could cause a reduction in the assessed value of taxable property within the District.  Any 
such reduction would result in a corresponding increase in the annual tax rate levied by the County to pay 
the  debt  service  with  respect  to  the  Bonds.    See  “THE  BONDS  –  Security  and  Sources  of  Payment” 
herein.  

Drought.  On January 17, 2014, the Governor of the State (the “Governor”) declared a State-wide 
Drought State of Emergency.  As of such date, the State faced water shortfalls due to the driest year in 
recorded State history; the State’s rivers and reservoirs were below their record low levels, and manual 
and  electronic  readings  recorded  the  water  content  of  snowpack  at  the  highest  elevations  in  the  State 
(chiefly in the Sierra Nevada mountain range) at about 20% of normal average for the winter season.  As 
part  of  his  State  of  Emergency  declaration,  the  Governor  directed  State  officials  to  assist  agricultural 
producers  and  communities  that  may  be  economically  impacted  by  dry  conditions.    Following  the 
Governor’s declaration, the California State Water Resources Control Board (the “Water Board”) issued a 
statewide notice of water shortages and potential future curtailment of water right diversions.  On April 1, 
2015,  the  Governor  issued  an  executive  order  mandating  certain  conservation  measures  including  a 
requirement that the Water Board impose restrictions to achieve a statewide 25% reduction in urban water 
usage through February 28, 2016. 

The  District  cannot  make  any  representation  regarding  the  effects  that  the  current  drought  has 
had, or, if it should continue, may have on the value of taxable property within the District, or to what 
extent the drought could cause disruptions to economic activity within the boundaries of the District. 

Appeals and Adjustments of Assessed Valuations. 

Under State law, property owners may apply for a reduction of their property tax assessment by 
filing a written application, in form prescribed by the State Board of Equalization, with the appropriate 
county board of equalization or assessment appeals board.  In most cases, the appeal is filed because the 
applicant believes that present market conditions (such as residential home prices) cause the property to 
be worth less than its current assessed value.  Any reduction in the assessment ultimately granted as a 
result  of  such  appeal  applies  to  the  year  for  which  application  is  made  and  during  which  the  written 
application was filed.   

Such  reductions  are  subject  to  yearly  reappraisals  and  may  be  adjusted  back  to  their  original 
values  when  market  conditions  improve.    Once  the  property  has  regained  its  prior  value,  adjusted  for 
inflation,  it  once  again  is  subject  to  the  annual  inflationary  factor  growth  rate  allowed  under  Article 
XIIIA.    See  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT 
REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS – Article XIIIA of the California Constitution” herein.   

A second type of assessment appeal involves a challenge to the base year value of an assessed 
property.    Appeals  for  reduction  in  the  base  year  value  of  an  assessment,  if  successful,  reduce  the 
assessment  for  the  year  in  which  the  appeal  is  taken  and  prospectively  thereafter.    The  base  year  is 
determined by the completion date of new construction or the date of change of ownership.  Any base 
year appeal must be made within four years of the change of ownership or new construction date.  

 
 

 16 

 

In addition to the above-described taxpayer appeals, county assessors may independently reduce 
assessed  valuations  based  on  changes  in  the  market  value  of  property,  or  for other  factors  such  as  the 
complete  or  partial  destruction  of  taxable  property  caused  by  natural  or  man-made  disasters  such  as 
earthquakes,  floods,  fire,  drought  or  toxic  contamination  pursuant  to  relevant  provisions  of  the  State 
Constitution.    See  also  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING 
DISTRICT  REVENUES  AND  APPROPRIATIONS  –  Article  XIIIA  of  the  California  Constitution” 
herein.  Such reductions are subject to yearly reappraisals by the county assessor and may be adjusted 
back to their original values when real estate market conditions improve.  Once property has regained its 
prior assessed value, adjusted for inflation, it once again is subject to the annual inflationary growth rate

Alternative Method of Tax Apportionment - “Teeter Plan” 

Certain  counties  in  the  State  operate  under  a  statutory  program  entitled  Alternate  Method  of 
Distribution  of  Tax  Levies  and  Collections  and  of  Tax  Sale  Proceeds  (the  “Teeter  Plan”).    Under  the 
Teeter Plan local taxing entities receive 100% of their tax levies net of delinquencies, but do not receive 
interest  or  penalties  on  delinquent  taxes  collected  by  the  county.    The  County  has  not  adopted  the 
Teeter  Plan,  and  consequently  the  Teeter  Plan  is  not  available  to  local  taxing  entities  within  the 
County,  such  as  the  District.    The  District’s  receipt  of  property  taxes  is  therefore  subject  to 
delinquencies. 

The  District  participates  in  the  California  Statewide  Delinquent  Tax  Finance  Authority 
(“CSDTFA”).    CSDTFA  is  a  joint  exercise  of  powers  agency  formed  for  the  purpose  of  purchasing 
delinquent  ad  valorem  property  taxes  of  its  members  in  accordance  with  Section  6516.6  of  the  State 
Government Code.  The District anticipates that CSDTFA will from time to time purchase delinquent ad 
valorem property tax receivables from the District at a purchase price equal to 110% of such receivable.  
Any penalty charges collected with respect to such delinquencies will be retained by CSDTFA. CSDTFA

does not ensure that the District will receive the timely payment of ad valorem property taxes levied to 
secure the Bonds.  See also “— Ad Valorem Property Taxation” herein. 

Tax Rates 

A  representative  tax  rate  area  (a  “TRA”)  located  within  the  District  is  TRA  5063.    The  table

Statement of Direct and Overlapping Debt 

Set  forth  on  the  following  page  is  a  direct  and  overlapping  debt  report  (the  “Debt  Report”) 
prepared  by  California  Municipal  Statistics,  Inc.  effective  as  of  January  1,  2016.    The  Debt  Report  is 
included  for  general  information  purposes  only.    The  District  has  not  reviewed  the  Debt  Report  for 
completeness or accuracy and makes no representation in connection therewith. 

The  Debt  Report  generally  includes  long-term  obligations  sold  in  the  public  credit  markets  by 
public  agencies  whose  boundaries  overlap  the  boundaries  of  the  District  in  whole  or  in  part.    Such 
long-term obligations generally are not payable from revenues of the District (except as indicated) nor are 
they  necessarily  obligations  secured  by  land  within  the  District.    In  many  cases  long-term  obligations 
issued by a public agency are payable only from the general fund or other revenues of such public agency. 

The  table  shows  the  percentage  of  each  overlapping  entity’s  assessed  value  located  within  the 
boundaries of the District.  The table also shows the corresponding portion of the overlapping entity’s 
existing debt payable from property taxes levied within the District.  The total amount of debt for each 
overlapping entity is not given in the table. 

 
 

 22 

 

The first column in the table names each public agency which has outstanding debt as of the date 
of the report and whose territory overlaps the District in whole or in part.  The second column shows the 
percentage  of  each  overlapping  agency’s  assessed  value  located  within  the  boundaries  of  the  District.  
This percentage, multiplied by the total outstanding debt of each overlapping agency (which is not shown 
in  the  table)  produces  the  amount  shown  in  the  third  column,  which  is  the  apportionment  of  each 
overlapping agency’s outstanding debt to taxable property in the District.

CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT 

REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS 

The principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable solely from the proceeds of an ad valorem 
property tax levied by the County for the payment thereof.  See “THE BONDS – Security and Sources of 
Payment” herein.  Articles XIIIA, XIIIB, XIIIC and XIIID of the State Constitution, Propositions 98 and 
111,  and  certain  other  provisions  of  law  discussed  below,  are  included  in  this  section  to  describe  the 
potential effect of these Constitutional and statutory measures on the ability of the County to levy taxes on 
behalf of the District and of the District to spend tax proceeds for operating and other purposes, and it 
should not be inferred from the inclusion of such materials that these laws impose any limitation on the 
ability of the County to levy taxes for payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.     

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution 

Article XIIIA  (“Article XIIIA”)  of  the  State  Constitution  limits  the  amount  of  ad  valorem 
property  taxes  on  real  property  to  1%  of  “full  cash  value”  as  determined  by  the  county  assessor.  
Article XIIIA defines “full cash value” to mean “the county assessor’s valuation of real property as shown 
on  the  1975-76  bill  under  “full  cash  value,”  or  thereafter,  the  appraised  value  of  real  property  when 
purchased, newly constructed or a change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment,” subject 
to exemptions in certain circumstances of property transfer or reconstruction.  Determined in this manner, 
the full cash value is also referred to as the “base year value.”  The “full cash value” is subject to annual 
adjustment to reflect increases, not to exceed 2% for any year, or decreases in the consumer price index or 
comparable local data, or to reflect reductions in property value caused by damage, destruction or other 
factors. 

Article XIIIA has been amended to allow for temporary reductions of assessed value in instances 
where the fair market value of real property falls below the adjusted base year value described above.  
Proposition 8—approved by the voters in November of 1978—provides for the enrollment of  the lesser 
of the base year value or the market value of real property, taking into account reductions in value due to 
damage, destruction, depreciation, obsolescence, removal of property, or other factors causing a similar 
decline.  In these instances, the market value is required to be reviewed annually until the market value 
exceeds  the  base  year  value,  adjusted  for  inflation.    Reductions  in  assessed  value  could  result  in  a 
corresponding increase in the annual tax rate levied by the County to pay debt service on the Bonds.  See 
“THE BONDS – Security and Sources of Payment” and “TAX BASE FOR PAYMENT OF BONDS – 
Assessed Valuations” herein.  

Article XIIIA requires a vote of two-thirds or more of the qualified electorate of a city, county, 
special district or other public agency to impose special taxes, while totally precluding the imposition of 
any additional ad valorem, sales or transaction tax on real property.  Article XIIIA exempts from the 1% 
tax limitation any taxes above that level required to pay debt service (a) on any indebtedness approved by 
the voters prior to July 1, 1978, or (b) as the result of an amendment approved by State voters on June 3, 
1986, on any bonded indebtedness approved by two-thirds or more of the votes cast by the voters for the 
acquisition or improvement of real property on or after July 1, 1978, or (c) bonded indebtedness incurred 
by  a  school district  or  community  college  district  for  the  construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation  or 
replacement of school facilities or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities, approved 
by  55%  or  more  of  the  votes  cast  on  the  proposition,  but  only  if  certain  accountability  measures  are 
included in the proposition.  The tax for payment of the Bonds falls within the exception described in (c) 
of the immediately preceding sentence.  In addition, Article XIIIA requires the approval of two-thirds or 
more of all members of the legislature of the State (the “State Legislature”) to change any State taxes for 
the purpose of increasing tax revenues.

Legislation Implementing Article XIIIA 

Legislation  has  been  enacted  and  amended  a  number  of  times  since  1978  to  implement 
Article XIIIA.  Under current law, local agencies are no longer permitted to levy directly any property tax 
(except to pay voter-approved indebtedness).  The 1% property tax is automatically levied by the relevant 
county and distributed according to a formula among taxing agencies.  The formula apportions the tax 
roughly in proportion to the relative shares of taxes levied prior to 1979. 

Increases of assessed valuation resulting from reappraisals of property due to new construction or 
change in ownership or from the annual adjustment not to exceed 2% are allocated among the various 
jurisdictions in the “taxing area” based upon their respective “situs.”  Any such allocation made to a local 
agency continues as part of its allocation in future years. 

All taxable property value included in this Official Statement is shown at 100% of taxable value 

(unless noted differently) and all tax rates reflect the $1 per $100 of taxable value. 

Both  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  and  the  State  Supreme  Court  have  upheld  the  general 

validity of Article XIIIA. 

State-Assessed Utility Property 

Some  amount  of  property  tax  revenue  of  the  District  is  derived  from  utility  property  which  is 
considered part of a utility system with components located in many taxing jurisdictions.  Under the State 
Constitution, such property is assessed by the State Board of Equalization as part of a “going concern” 
rather than as individual pieces of real or personal property.  Such State-assessed property is allocated to 
the counties by the State Board of Equalization, taxed at special county-wide rates, and the tax revenues 
distributed to taxing jurisdictions (including the District) according to statutory formulae generally based 
on the distribution of taxes in the prior year. 

The State electric utility industry has experienced significant changes in its structure and in the 
way in which components of the industry are regulated and owned.  Sale of electric generation assets to 
largely  unregulated,  nonutility  companies  may  affect  how  those  assets  are  assessed,  and  which  local 
agencies are to receive the property taxes.  The District is unable to predict the impact of these changes on 
its  utility  property  tax  revenues,  or  whether  legislation  may  be  proposed  or  adopted  in  response  to 
industry restructuring, or whether any future litigation may affect ownership of utility assets or the State’s 
methods  of  assessing  utility  property  and  the  allocation  of  assessed  value  to  local  taxing  agencies, 
including the District.  So long as the District is not a basic aid district, taxes lost through any reduction in 
assessed valuation will be compensated by the State as equalization aid under the State’s school financing 
formula.  See “DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION – State Funding of Education” herein.   

Article XIIIB of the California Constitution 

Article XIIIB  (“Article  XIIIB”)  of  the  State  Constitution,  as  subsequently  amended  by 
Propositions  98  and  111,  respectively,  limits  the  annual  appropriations  of  the  State  and  of  any  city, 
county, school district, authority or other political subdivision of the State to the level of appropriations of 
the particular governmental entity for the prior fiscal year, as adjusted for changes in the cost of living 
and in population and for transfers in the financial responsibility for providing services and for certain 
declared emergencies.  As amended, Article XIIIB defines: 

(a) 

“change  in  the  cost  of  living”  with  respect  to  school  districts  to  mean  the  percentage 
change in State per capita income from the preceding year, and 

 
 

 25 

 

(b) 

“change in population” with respect to a school district to mean the percentage change in 
the ADA of the school district from the preceding fiscal year. 

For  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  after  July 1,  1990,  the  appropriations  limit  of  each  entity  of 
government shall be the appropriations limit for the 1986-87 fiscal year adjusted for the changes made 
from that fiscal year pursuant to the provisions of Article XIIIB, as amended. 

The appropriations of an entity of local government subject to Article XIIIB limitations include 
the  proceeds  of  taxes  levied  by  or  for  that  entity  and  the  proceeds  of  certain  state  subventions  to  that 
entity.  “Proceeds of taxes” include, but are not limited to, all tax revenues and the proceeds to the entity 
from (a) regulatory licenses, user charges and user fees (but only to the extent that these proceeds exceed 
the  reasonable  costs  in  providing  the  regulation,  product  or  service),  and  (b) the  investment  of  tax 
revenues. 

Appropriations  subject  to  limitation  do  not  include  (a) refunds  of  taxes,  (b) appropriations  for 
debt service such as the Bonds, (c) appropriations required to comply with certain mandates of the courts 
or  the  federal  government,  (d) appropriations  of  certain  special  districts,  (e) appropriations  for  all 
qualified  capital  outlay  projects  as  defined  by  the  State  Legislature,  (f) appropriations  derived  from 
certain fuel and vehicle taxes and (g) appropriations derived from certain taxes on tobacco products. 

Article XIIIB includes a requirement that all revenues received by an entity of government other 
than  the  State  in  a  fiscal  year  and  in  the  fiscal  year  immediately  following  it  in  excess  of  the  amount 
permitted to be appropriated during that fiscal year and the fiscal year immediately following it shall be 
returned by a revision of tax rates or fee schedules within the next two subsequent fiscal years. 

Article XIIIB  also  includes  a  requirement  that  50%  of  all  revenues  received  by  the  State  in  a 
fiscal  year  and  in  the  fiscal  year  immediately  following  it  in  excess  of  the  amount  permitted  to  be 
appropriated during that fiscal year and the fiscal year immediately following it shall be transferred and 
allocated to the State School Fund pursuant to Section 8.5 of Article XVI of the State Constitution.  See 
“— Propositions 98 and 111” herein. 

Article XIIIC and Article XIIID of the California Constitution 

On November 5, 1996, the voters of the State approved Proposition 218, popularly known as the 
“Right to Vote on Taxes Act.”  Proposition 218 added to the State Constitution Articles XIIIC and XIIID 
(respectively, “Article XIIIC” and “Article XIIID”), which contain a number of provisions affecting the 
ability  of  local  agencies,  including  school  districts,  to  levy  and  collect  both  existing  and  future  taxes, 
assessments, fees and charges. 

According  to  the  “Title  and  Summary”  of  Proposition 218  prepared  by  the  State  Attorney 
General, Proposition 218 limits “the authority of local governments to impose taxes and property-related 
assessments, fees and charges.”  Among other things, Article XIIIC establishes that every tax is either a 
“general  tax”  (imposed  for  general  governmental  purposes)  or  a  “special  tax”  (imposed  for  specific 
purposes), prohibits special purpose government agencies such as school districts from levying general 
taxes, and prohibits any local agency from imposing, extending or increasing any special tax beyond its 
maximum authorized rate without a two-thirds vote; and also provides that the initiative power will  not 
be limited in matters of reducing or repealing local taxes, assessments, fees and charges.  Article XIIIC 
further provides that no tax may be assessed on property other than ad valorem property taxes imposed in 
accordance  with  Articles  XIII  and  XIIIA  of  the  State  Constitution  and  special  taxes  approved  by  a 
two-thirds  vote  under  Article  XIIIA,  Section 4. 
  Article  XIIID  deals  with  assessments  and 
property-related fees and charges, and explicitly provides that nothing in Article XIIIC or XIIID will be 

 
 

 26 

 

construed to affect existing laws relating to the imposition of fees or charges as a condition of property 
development. 

The District does not impose any taxes, assessments, or property-related fees or charges which 
are subject to the provisions of Proposition 218.  It does, however, receive a portion of the basic 1% ad 
valorem  property  tax  levied  and  collected  by  the  County  pursuant  to  Article  XIIIA  of  the  State 
Constitution.  The provisions of Proposition 218 may have an indirect effect on the District, such as by 
limiting  or  reducing  the  revenues  otherwise  available  to  other  local  governments  whose  boundaries 
encompass property located within the District thereby causing such local governments to reduce service 
levels and possibly adversely affecting the value of property within the District. 

Proposition 26 

On  November  2,  2010,  voters  in  the  State  approved  Proposition  26.  Proposition  26  amends 
Article XIIIC of the State Constitution to expand the definition of “tax”  to include “any levy, charge, or 
exaction of any kind imposed by a local government” except the following:  (1) a charge imposed for a 
specific  benefit  conferred  or  privilege  granted  directly  to  the  payor  that  is  not  provided  to  those  not 
charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit 
or  granting  the  privilege;  (2)  a  charge  imposed  for  a  specific  government  service  or  product  provided 
directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable 
costs to the local government of providing the service or product; (3) a charge imposed for the reasonable 
regulatory  costs  to  a  local  government  for  issuing  licenses  and  permits,  performing  investigations, 
inspections, and audits, enforcing agricultural marketing orders, and the administrative enforcement and 
adjudication thereof;  (4)  a  charge  imposed  for  entrance  to  or  use  of  local  government  property, or  the 
purchase,  rental,  or  lease  of  local  government  property;  (5)  a  fine,  penalty,  or  other  monetary  charge 
imposed by the judicial branch of government or a local government, as a result of a violation of law; (6) 
a charge imposed as a condition of property development; and (7) assessments and property-related fees 
imposed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article  XIIID.    Proposition  26  provides  that  the  local 
government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy, charge, or other 
exaction  is  not  a  tax,  that  the  amount  is  no  more  than  necessary  to  cover  the  reasonable  costs  of  the 
governmental activity, and that the manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor bear a fair or 
reasonable relationship to the payor’s burdens on, or benefits received from, the governmental activity.   

Propositions 98 and 111 

On  November  8,  1988,  voters  of  the  State  approved  Proposition 98,  a  combined  initiative 
constitutional  amendment  and  statute  called 
the  “Classroom  Instructional  Improvement  and 
Accountability  Act”  (the  “Accountability  Act”).    Certain  provisions  of  the  Accountability  Act  have, 
however, been modified by Proposition 111, discussed below, the provisions of which became effective 
on July 1, 1990.  The Accountability Act changed State funding of public education below the university 
level  and  the  operation  of  the  State’s  appropriations  limit.    The  Accountability  Act  guarantees  State 
funding for K-12 school districts and community college districts (hereinafter referred to collectively as 
“K-14 school districts”) at a level equal to the greater of (a) the same percentage of the State general fund 
revenues as the percentage appropriated to such districts in the 1986-87 fiscal  year, and (b) the amount 
actually appropriated to such districts from the State general fund in the previous fiscal year, adjusted for 
increases  in  enrollment  and  changes  in  the  cost  of  living.    The  Accountability  Act  permits  the  State 
Legislature to suspend this formula for a one-year period.   

The Accountability Act also changed how tax revenues in excess of the State appropriations limit 
are distributed.  Any excess State tax revenues up to a specified amount are, instead of being returned to 
taxpayers, is transferred to K-14 school districts.  Any such transfer to K-14 school districts is excluded 

 
 

 27 

 

from the appropriations limit for K-14 school districts and the K-14 school district appropriations limit for 
the next year is automatically increased by the amount of such transfer.  These additional moneys enter 
the base funding calculation for K-14 school districts for subsequent years, creating further pressure on 
other portions of the State budget, particularly if revenues decline in a year following an Article XIIIB 
surplus.  The maximum amount of excess tax revenues which can be transferred to K-14 school districts 
is 4% of the minimum State spending for education mandated by the Accountability Act. 

Since the Accountability Act is unclear in some details, there can be no assurances that the State 
Legislature or a court might not interpret the Accountability Act to require a different percentage of State 
general fund revenues to be allocated to K-14 school districts, or to apply the relevant percentage to the 
State’s budgets in a different way than is proposed in the State budget. 

On  June 5,  1990,  the  voters  of  the  State  approved  Proposition 111  (Senate  Constitutional 
Amendment  No. 1)  called  the  “Traffic  Congestion  Relief  and  Spending  Limitation  Act  of  1990” 
(“Proposition 111”) which further modified Article XIIIB and Sections 8 and 8.5 of Article XVI of the 
State Constitution with respect to appropriations limitations and school funding priority and allocation. 

The most significant provisions of Proposition 111 are summarized as follows: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

Annual  Adjustments  to  Spending  Limit.    The  annual  adjustments  to  the  Article  XIIIB 
spending limit were liberalized to be more closely linked to the rate of economic growth.  
Instead of being tied to the Consumer Price Index, the “change in the cost of living” is 
now  measured  by  the  change  in  State  per  capita  personal  income.    The  definition  of 
“change  in  population”  specifies  that  a  portion  of  the  State’s  spending  limit  is  to  be 
adjusted to reflect changes in school attendance. 

Treatment of Excess Tax Revenues.  “Excess” tax revenues with respect to Article XIIIB 
are  now  determined  based  on  a  two-year  cycle,  so  that  the  State  can  avoid  having  to 
return to taxpayers excess tax revenues in one year if its appropriations in the next fiscal 
year are under its limit.  In addition, the Proposition 98 provision regarding excess tax 
revenues was modified.  After any two-year period, if there are excess State tax revenues, 
50% of the excess are to be transferred to K-14 school districts with the balance returned 
to taxpayers; under prior law, 100% of excess State tax revenues went to K-14 school 
districts,  but  only  up  to  a  maximum  of  4%  of  the  minimum  funding  level  for  such 
districts.    Also,  reversing  prior  law,  any  excess  State  tax  revenues  transferred  to  K-14 
school districts are not built into K-14 school districts’ base expenditures for calculating 
their entitlement for State aid in the next year, and the State’s appropriations limit is not 
to be increased by this amount. 

Exclusions  from  Spending  Limit.    Two  exceptions  were  added  to  the  calculation  of 
appropriations  which  are  subject  to  the  Article  XIIIB  spending  limit.    First,  there  are 
excluded all appropriations for “qualified capital outlay projects” as defined by the State 
Legislature.  Second, there are excluded any increases in gasoline taxes above the 1990 
level (then nine cents per gallon), sales and use taxes on such increment in gasoline taxes, 
and increases in receipts from vehicle weight fees above the levels in effect on January 1, 
1990.    These  latter  provisions  were  necessary  to  make  effective  the  transportation 
funding  package  approved  by  the  State  Legislature  and  the  Governor,  which  was 
expected  to  raise  over  $15  billion  in  additional  taxes  from  1990  through  2000  to  fund 
transportation programs. 

 
 

 28 

 

d. 

e. 

Recalculation of Appropriations Limit.  The Article XIIIB appropriations limit for each 
unit  of  government,  including  the  State,  is  to  be  recalculated  beginning  in  fiscal  year 
1990-91.  It is based on the actual limit for fiscal year 1986-87, adjusted forward to 1990-
91 as if Proposition 111 had been in effect. 

School  Funding  Guarantee.    There  is  a  complex  adjustment  in  the  formula  enacted  in 
Proposition 98 which guarantees K-14 school districts a certain amount of State general 
fund revenues.  Under prior law, K-14 school districts were guaranteed the greater of (1) 
40.9% of State general fund revenues (“Test 1”) or (2) the amount appropriated in the 
prior  year  adjusted  for  changes  in  the  cost  of  living  (measured  as  in  Article  XIIIB  by 
reference to per capita personal income) and enrollment (“Test 2”).  Under Proposition 
111, schools will receive the greater of (1) Test 1, (2) Test 2, or (3) a third test (“Test 3”), 
which  will  replace  Test  2  in  any  year  when  growth  in  per  capita  State  general  fund 
revenues  from  the  prior  year  is  less  than  the  annual  growth  in  the  State  per  capital 
personal  income.    Under  Test  3,  K-14  school  districts  will  receive  the  amount 
appropriated  in  the  prior  year  adjusted  for  change  in  enrollment  and  per  capita  State 
general fund revenues, plus an additional small adjustment factor.  If Test 3 is used in any 
year, the difference between Test 3 and Test 2 will become a “credit” to schools which 
will  be  paid  in  future  years  when  State  general  fund  revenue  growth  exceeds  personal 
income growth. 

Proposition 39 

On November 7, 2000, State voters approved an amendment (commonly known as Proposition 
39) to the State Constitution. This amendment (1) allows school facilities bond measures to be approved 
by 55% (rather than two-thirds) of the voters in local elections and permits property taxes to exceed the 
current  1%  limit  in  order  to  repay  the  bonds  and  (2)  changes  existing  statutory  law  regarding  charter 
school facilities.  As adopted, the constitutional amendments may be changed only with another statewide 
vote of the people. The statutory provisions could be changed by a majority vote of both houses of the 
State Legislature and approval by the Governor, but only to further the purposes of the proposition. The 
local  school  jurisdictions  affected  by  this  proposition  are  K-12  school  districts,  including  the  District, 
community  college  districts,  and  county  offices  of  education.    As  noted  above,  the  State  Constitution 
previously limited property taxes to 1% of the value of property.  Property taxes could only exceed this 
limit to pay for (1) any local government debts approved by the voters prior to July 1, 1978 or (2) bonds 
to acquire or improve real property that receive two-thirds voter approval after July 1, 1978. 

The 55% vote requirement authorized by Proposition 39 applies only if the local bond measure 
presented to the voters includes: (1) a requirement that the bond funds can be used only for construction, 
rehabilitation,  equipping  of  school  facilities,  or  the  acquisition  or  lease  of  real  property  for  school 
facilities;  (2)  a  specific  list  of  school  projects  to  be  funded  and  certification  that  the  school  board  has 
evaluated safety, class size reduction, and information technology needs in developing the list; and (3) a 
requirement that the school board conduct annual, independent financial and performance audits until all 
bond funds have been spent to ensure that the bond funds have been used only for the projects listed in the 
measure.  Legislation  approved  in  June  2000  placed  certain  limitations  on  local  school  bonds  to  be 
approved by 55% of the voters.  These provisions require that the tax rate projected to be levied as the 
result of any single election be no more than $60 (for a unified school district, such as the District), $30 
(for a high school or elementary school district), or $25 (for a community college district) per $100,000 of 
taxable property value, when assessed valuation is projected to increase in accordance with Article XIIIA 
of the State Constitution.  These requirements are not part of Proposition 39 and can be changed with a 
majority vote of both houses of the State Legislature and approval by the Governor.  See “- Article XIIIA 
of the California Constitution” herein.

Jarvis vs. Connell 

On May 29, 2002, the State Court of Appeal for the Second District decided the case of Howard 
 
Jarvis Taxpayers Association, et al. v. Kathleen Connell (as Controller of the State).  The Court of Appeal 
held that either a final budget bill, an emergency appropriation, a self-executing authorization pursuant to 
state  statutes  (such  as  continuing  appropriations)  or  the  State  Constitution  or  a  federal  mandate  is 
necessary for the State Controller to disburse funds.  The foregoing requirement could apply to amounts 
budgeted by the District as being received from the State.  To the extent the holding in such case would 
apply  to  State  payments  reflected  in  the  District’s  budget,  the  requirement  that  there  be  either  a  final 
budget bill or an emergency appropriation may result in the delay of such payments to the District if such 
required legislative action is delayed, unless the payments are self-executing authorizations or are subject 
to  a  federal  mandate.    On  May  1,  2003,  the  State  Supreme  Court  upheld  the  holding  of  the  Court  of 
Appeal,  stating  that  the  Controller  is  not  authorized  under  State  law  to  disburse  funds  prior  to  the 
enactment  of  a  budget  or other  proper appropriation, but  under  federal  law,  the  Controller  is  required, 
notwithstanding  a  budget  impasse  and  the  limitations  imposed  by  State  law,  to  timely  pay  those  State 
employees who are subject to the minimum wage and overtime compensation provisions of the federal 
Fair Labor Standards Act. 
 
Proposition 1A and Proposition 22 

On  November  2,  2004,  State  voters  approved  Proposition  1A,  which  amends  the  State 
Constitution to significantly reduce the State’s authority over major local government revenue sources.  
Under Proposition 1A, the State cannot (i) reduce local sales tax rates or alter the method of allocating the 
revenue  generated  by  such  taxes,  (ii)  shift  property  taxes  from  local  governments  to  schools  or 
community colleges, (iii) change how property tax revenues are shared among local governments without 
two-third approval of both houses of the State Legislature or (iv) decrease Vehicle License Fee revenues 
without  providing  local  governments  with  equal  replacement  funding.    Proposition  1A  does  allow  the 
State  to  approve  voluntary  exchanges  of  local  sales  tax  and  property  tax  revenues  among  local 
governments within a county.  Proposition 1A also amends the State Constitution to require the State to 
suspend  certain  State  laws  creating  mandates  in  any year  that  the  State  does  not  fully  reimburse  local 
governments  for  their  costs  to  comply  with  the  mandates.    This  provision  does  not  apply to  mandates 
relating to schools or community colleges or to those mandates relating to employee rights. 

Proposition 22, The Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and Transportation Protection Act, approved 
by the voters of the State on November 2, 2010, prohibits the State from enacting new laws that require 
redevelopment agencies to shift funds to schools or other agencies and eliminates the State’s authority to 
shift property taxes temporarily during a severe financial hardship of the State.  In addition, Proposition 
22 restricts the State’s authority to use State fuel tax revenues to pay debt service on state transportation 
bonds,  to  borrow  or  change  the  distribution  of  state  fuel  tax  revenues,  and  to  use  vehicle  license  fee 
revenues to reimburse local governments for state mandated costs.  Proposition 22 impacts resources in 
the  State’s  general  fund  and  transportation  funds,  the  State’s  main  funding  source  for  schools  and 
community colleges, as well as universities, prisons and health and social services programs.  According 
to an analysis of Proposition 22 submitted by the Legislative Analyst’s Office (the “LAO”) on July 15, 
2010, the expected reduction in resources available for the State to spend on these other programs as a 
consequence of the passage of Proposition 22 was projected to be approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 
2010-11, with an estimated immediate fiscal effect equal to approximately 1% of the State’s total general 
fund spending.  The longer-term effect of Proposition 22, according to the LAO analysis, was expected to 
be an increase in the State’s general fund costs by approximately $1 billion annually for several decades.

Proposition 30 

On  November  6,  2012,  State  voters  approved  the  Temporary  Taxes  to  Fund  Education, 
Guaranteed  Local  Public  Safety  Funding,  Initiative  Constitutional  Amendment  (also  known  as 
“Proposition 30”), which temporarily increases the State Sales and Use Tax and personal income tax rates 
on higher incomes.  Proposition 30 temporarily imposes an additional tax on all retailers, at the rate of 
0.25% of gross receipts from the sale of all tangible personal property sold in the State from January 1, 
2013 to December 31, 2016.  Proposition 30 also imposes an additional excise tax on the storage, use, or 
other  consumption  in  the  State  of  tangible  personal  property  purchased  from  a  retailer  on  and  after 
January 1, 2013 and before January 1, 2017, for storage, use, or other consumption in the State.  This 
excise tax will be levied at a rate of 0.25% of the sales price of the property so purchased.  For personal 
income taxes imposed beginning in the taxable year commencing January 1, 2012 and ending December 
31, 2018, Proposition 30 increases the marginal personal income tax rate by: (i) 1% for taxable income 
over $250,000 but less than $300,001 for single filers (over $500,000 but less than $600,001 for joint 
filers and over $340,000 but less than $408,001 for head-of-household filers), (ii) 2% for taxable income 
over $300,000 but less than $500,001 for single filers (over $600,000 but less than $1,000,001 for joint 
filers and over $408,000 but less than $680,001 for head-of-household filers), and (iii) 3% for taxable 
income over $500,000 for single filers (over $1,000,000 for joint filers and over $680,000 for head-of-
household filers). 

The revenues generated from the temporary tax increases will be included in the calculation of 
the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee for school districts and community college districts.  See 
“– Propositions 98 and 111” herein.  From an accounting perspective, the revenues generated from the 
temporary tax increases will be deposited into the State account created pursuant to Proposition 30 called 
the  Education  Protection Account  (the  “EPA”).    Pursuant  to  Proposition 30,  funds  in  the  EPA  will  be 
allocated quarterly, with 89% of such funds provided to schools districts and 11% provided to community 
college districts.  The funds are being distributed to school districts and community college districts in the 
same manner as existing unrestricted per-student funding, except that no school district will receive less 
than $200 per unit of ADA and no community college district will receive less than $100 per full time 
equivalent student.  The governing board of each school district and community college district is granted 
sole  authority  to  determine  how  the  moneys  received  from  the  EPA  are  spent,  provided  that  the 
appropriate governing board is required to make these spending determinations in open session at a public 
meeting and such local governing boards are prohibited from using any funds from the EPA for salaries 
or benefits of administrators or any other administrative costs. 

Proposition 2 

On  November  4,  2014,  voters  approved  the  Rainy  Day  Budget  Stabilization  Fund  Act  (also 
known  as  “Proposition  2”).   Proposition  2  is  a  legislatively-referred  constitutional  amendment  which 
makes certain changes to State budgeting practices, including substantially revising the conditions under 
which transfers are made to and from the State’s Budget Stabilization Account (the “BSA”) established 
by the California Balanced Budget Act of 2004 (also known as Proposition 58).   

 
 

 31 

 

Under  Proposition  2,  and  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2015-16  and  each  fiscal  year  thereafter,  the 
State will generally be required to annually transfer to the BSA an amount equal to 1.5% of estimated 
State  general  fund  revenues  (the  “Annual  BSA  Transfer”).   Supplemental  transfers  to  the  BSA  (a 
“Supplemental BSA Transfer”) are also required in any fiscal year in which the estimated State general 
fund revenues that are allocable to capital gains taxes exceed 8% of the total estimated general fund tax 
revenues.   Such  excess  capital  gains  taxes—net  of  any  portion  thereof  owed  to  K-14  school  districts 
pursuant to Proposition 98—will be transferred to the BSA.  Proposition 2 also increases the maximum 
size of the BSA to an amount equal to 10% of estimated State general fund revenues for any given fiscal 
year.  In any fiscal year in which a required transfer to the BSA would result in an amount in excess of the 
10%  threshold,  Proposition  2  requires  such  excess  to  be  expended  on  State  infrastructure,  including 
deferred maintenance.   

For the first 15-year period ending with the 2029-30 fiscal year, Proposition 2 provides that half 
of any required transfer to the BSA, either annual or supplemental, must be appropriated to reduce certain 
State  liabilities,  including  making  certain  payments  owed  to  K-14  school  districts,  repaying  State 
interfund  borrowing,  reimbursing  local  governments  for  State  mandated  services,  and  reducing  or 
prefunding accrued liabilities associated with State-level pension and retirement benefits.  Following the 
initial 15-year period, the Governor and the State Legislature are given discretion to apply up to half of 
any  required  transfer  to  the  BSA  to  the  reduction  of  such  State  liabilities.   Any  amount  not  applied 
towards such reduction must be transferred to the BSA or applied to infrastructure, as described above. 

Proposition 2 changes the conditions under which the Governor and the State Legislature  may 
draw upon or reduce transfers to the BSA.  The Governor does not retain unilateral discretion to suspend 
transfers to the BSA, nor does the State Legislature retain discretion to transfer funds from the BSA for 
any reason, as previously provided by law.  Rather, the Governor must declare a “budget emergency,” 
defined as an emergency within the meaning of Article XIIIB of the Constitution or a determination that 
estimated  resources  are  inadequate  to  fund  State  general  fund  expenditures,  for  the  current  or  ensuing 
fiscal year, at a level equal to the highest level of State spending within the three immediately preceding 
fiscal  years.   Any  such  declaration  must  be  followed  by  a  legislative  bill  providing  for  a  reduction  or 
transfer.  Draws on the BSA are limited to the amount necessary to address the budget emergency, and no 
draw in any fiscal year may exceed 50% of the funds on deposit in the BSA unless a budget emergency 
was declared in the preceding fiscal year.  

Proposition 2 also requires the creation of the Public School System Stabilization Account (the 
“PSSSA”) into which transfers will be made in any fiscal year in which a Supplemental BSA Transfer is 
required (as described above).  Such transfer will be equal to the portion of capital gains taxes above the 
8%  threshold  that  would  otherwise  be  paid  to  K-14  school  districts  as  part  of  the  minimum  funding 
guarantee.  A transfer to the PSSSA will only be made if certain additional conditions are met, as follows: 
(i) the minimum funding guarantee was not suspended in the immediately preceding fiscal year, (ii) the 
operative Proposition 98 formula for the fiscal year in which a PSSSA transfer might be made is “Test 1,” 
(iii) no maintenance factor obligation is being created in the budgetary legislation for the fiscal year in 
which  a  PSSSA  transfer  might  be  made,  (iv)  all  prior  maintenance  factor  obligations  have  been  fully 
repaid, and (v) the minimum funding guarantee for the fiscal year in which a PSSSA transfer might be 
made  is  higher  than  the  immediately  preceding  fiscal  year,  as  adjusted  for  ADA  growth  and  cost  of 
living.   Proposition  2  caps  the  size  of  the  PSSSA  at  10%  of  the  estimated  minimum  guarantee  in  any 
fiscal  year,  and  any  excess  funds  must  be  paid  to  K-14  school  districts.   Reductions  to  any  required 
transfer to the PSSSA, or draws on the PSSSA, are subject to the same budget emergency requirements 
described above.  However, Proposition 2 also mandates draws on the PSSSA in any fiscal year in which 
the estimated minimum funding guarantee is less than the prior year’s funding level, as adjusted for ADA 
growth and cost of living.

Future Initiatives 

Article  XIIIA,  Article  XIIIB,  Article  XIIIC  and  Article  XIIID  of  the  State  Constitution  and 
Propositions 22, 26, 30, 39, and 98 were each adopted as measures that qualified for the ballot pursuant to 
the  State’s  initiative  process.    From  time  to  time  other  initiative  measures  could  be  adopted  further 
affecting District revenues or the District’s ability to expend revenues.  The nature and impact of these 
measures cannot be anticipated by the District.   

DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

The information in this section concerning State funding of public education and the District’s 
finances is provided as supplementary information only, and it should not be inferred from the inclusion 
of this information in this Official Statement that the principal of or interest on the Bonds are payable 
from the general fund of the District.  The principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable solely from 
the proceeds of an ad valorem property tax which is required to be levied by the County in the District in 
an amount sufficient for the payment thereof.  See “THE BONDS – Security and Sources of Payment” 
herein. 
State Funding of Education 

School district revenues consist primarily of guaranteed State moneys, local property taxes and 
funds received from the State in the form of categorical aid under ongoing programs of local assistance.  
All State aid is subject to the appropriation of funds in the State’s annual budget.   

Revenue  Limit  Funding.    Previously,  school  districts  operated  under  general  purpose  revenue 
limits established by the State Department of Education.  In general, revenue limits were calculated for 
each school district by multiplying the ADA for such district by a base revenue limit per unit of ADA.  
Revenue limit calculations were subject to adjustment in accordance with a number of factors designed to 
provide  cost  of  living  adjustments  (“COLAs”)  and  to  equalize  revenues  among  school  districts  of  the 
same type.  Funding of a school district’s revenue limit was provided by a mix of local property taxes and 
State apportionments of basic and equalization aid.  Since fiscal year 2013-14, school districts have been 
funded based on uniform system of funding grants assigned to certain grade spans.  See “— Local Control 
Funding Formula” herein.

(1)  Reflects ADA as of the second principal reporting period (“P-2 ADA”), which ends on or before the last attendance month 
prior to April 15 of each school year.  An attendance month is equal to each four-week period of instruction beginning with the 
first day of school for a particular school district. 
(2)  Deficit revenue limit funding, when provided for in State budgetary legislation, reduced the revenue limit allocations received 
by  school  districts  by  applying  a  deficit  factor  to  the  base  revenue  limit  for  the  given  fiscal  year,  and  resulted  from  an 
insufficiency of appropriation funds in the State budget to provide for State aid owed to school districts.  The State’s practice of 
deficit  revenue  limit  funding  was  most  recently  reinstated  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2008-09,  and  discontinued  following  the 
implementation of the LCFF (as defined herein) in fiscal year 2013-14.

Local Control Funding Formula.  State Assembly Bill 97 (Stats. 2013, Chapter 47) (“AB 97”), 
enacted  as  part  of  the  fiscal  year  2013-14  State  budget,  established  a  new  system  for  funding  school 
districts, charter schools and county offices of education.  Certain provisions of AB 97 were amended and 
clarified by Senate Bill 91 (Stats. 2013, Chapter 49) (“SB 91”). 

The primary component of AB 97, as amended by SB 91, was the implementation of the Local 
Control  Funding  Formula  (“LCFF”),  which  replaced the  revenue  limit  funding  system  for  determining 
State apportionments, as well as the majority of State categorical program funding.  State allocations are 
provided on the basis of target base funding grants per unit of ADA (a “Base Grant”) assigned to each of 
four grade spans.  Each Base Grant is subject to certain adjustments and add-ons, as discussed below.  
Full implementation of the LCFF is expected to occur over a period of several fiscal years.  Beginning in 
fiscal year 2013-14, an annual transition adjustment is required to be calculated for each school district, 
equal to such district’s proportionate share of appropriations included in the State budget to close the gap 
between the prior-year funding level and the target allocation following full implementation of the LCFF.  
In each year, school districts will have the same proportion of their respective funding gaps closed, with 
dollar amounts varying depending on the size of a district’s funding gap.   

The Base Grants per unit of ADA for each grade span are as follows: (i) $6,845 for grades K-3; 
(ii) $6,947 for grades 4-6; (iii) $7,154 for grades 7-8; and (iv) $8,289 for grades 9-12.  Beginning in fiscal 
year 2013-14, and in each subsequent year, the Base Grants are to be adjusted for COLAs by applying the 
implicit price deflator for government goods and services.  Following full implementation of the LCFF, 
the provision of COLAs will be subject to appropriation for such adjustment in the annual State budget.  
The differences among Base Grants are linked to differentials in statewide average revenue limit rates by 
district type, and are intended to recognize the generally higher costs of education at higher grade levels.  
See “—State Budget Measures” herein for information on the adjusted Base Grants provided by current 
State budgetary legislation. 

 
 

 34 

 

The  Base  Grants  for  grades  K-3  and  9-12  are  subject  to  adjustments  of  10.4%  and  2.6%, 
respectively, to cover the costs of class size reduction in early grades and the provision of career technical 
education in high schools.  Following full implementation of the LCFF, and unless otherwise collectively 
bargained for, school districts serving students in grades K-3 must maintain an average class enrollment 
of 24 or fewer students in grades K-3 at each school site in order to continue receiving the adjustment to 
the K-3 Base Grant.  Such school districts must also make progress towards this class size reduction goal 
in proportion to the growth in their funding over the implementation period.  Additional add-ons are also 
provided  to  school  districts  that  received  categorical  block  grant  funding  pursuant  to  the  Targeted 
Instructional Improvement and Home-to-School Transportation programs during fiscal year 2012-13.   

School districts that serve students of limited English proficiency (“EL” students), students from 
low income families that are eligible for free or reduced priced meals (“LI” students) and foster youth are 
eligible to receive additional funding grants.  Enrollment counts are unduplicated, such that students may 
not be counted as both EL and LI (foster youth automatically meet the eligibility requirements for free or 
reduced priced meals, and are therefore not discussed separately herein).  A supplemental grant add-on 
(each, a “Supplemental Grant”) is authorized for school districts that serve EL/LI students, equal to 20% 
of  the  applicable  Base  Grant  multiplied  by  such  district’s  percentage  of  unduplicated  EL/LI  student 
enrollment.  School districts whose EL/LI populations exceed 55% of their total enrollment are eligible 
for  a  concentration  grant  add-on  (each,  a  “Concentration  Grant”)  equal  to  50%  of  the  applicable  Base 
Grant multiplied by the percentage of such district’s unduplicated EL/LI student enrollment in excess of 
the 55% threshold.     

The following table shows a breakdown of the District’s ADA by grade span, total enrollment, 

and the percentage of EL/LI student enrollment, for fiscal years 2012-13 through 2015-16.

October), which is reported to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (“CALPADS”) in each school year 
and used to calculate each school district’s unduplicated EL/LI student enrollment.  Adjustments may be made to the certified 
EL/LI  counts  by  the  State  Department  of  Education.    CALPADS  figures  generally  exclude  preschool  and  adult  transitional 
students.  For purposes of calculating Supplemental and Concentration Grants, a school district’s fiscal year 2013-14 percentage 
of unduplicated EL/LI students is expressed solely as a percentage of its total fiscal year 2013-14 total enrollment.  For fiscal year 
2014-15, the percentage of unduplicated EL/LI enrollment is based on the two-year average of EL/LI enrollment in fiscal years 
2013-14 and 2014-15.  Beginning in fiscal year 2015-16, a school district’s percentage of unduplicated EL/LI students will be 
based on a rolling average of such district’s EL/LI enrollment for the then-current fiscal year and the two immediately preceding 
fiscal years.

For  certain  school  districts  that  would  have  received  greater  funding  levels  under  the  prior 
revenue  limit  system,  the  LCFF  provides  for  a  permanent  economic  recovery  target  (“ERT”)  add-on, 
equal to the difference between the revenue limit allocations such districts would have received under the 
prior system in fiscal year 2020-21, and the target LCFF allocations owed to such districts in the same 
year.  To derive the projected funding levels, the LCFF assumes the discontinuance of deficit revenue 
limit funding, implementation of a 1.94% COLA in fiscal years 2014-15 through 2020-21, and restoration 
of categorical funding to pre-recession levels.  The ERT add-on will be paid incrementally over the LCFF 
implementation period. The District does not qualify for the ERT add-on.   

The  sum  of  a  school  district’s  adjusted  Base,  Supplemental  and  Concentration  Grants  will  be 
multiplied  by  such  district’s  P-2  ADA  for  the  current  or  prior year,  whichever  is  greater  (with  certain 
adjustments applicable to small school districts).  This funding amount, together with any applicable ERT 
or categorical block grant add-ons, will yield a district’s total LCFF allocation.  Generally, the amount of 
annual State apportionments received by a school district will amount to the difference between such total 
LCFF allocation and such district’s share of applicable local property taxes.  Most school districts receive 
a  significant  portion  of  their  funding  from  such  State  apportionments.    As  a  result,  decreases  in  State 
revenues may significantly affect appropriations made by the State Legislature to school districts. 

Certain  schools  districts,  known  as  “basic  aid”  districts,  have  allocable  local  property  tax 
collections that equal or exceed such districts’ total LCFF allocation, and result in the receipt of no State 
apportionment aid.  Basic aid school districts receive only special categorical funding, which is deemed to 
satisfy the “basic aid” requirement of $120 per student per year guaranteed by Article IX, Section 6 of the 
State Constitution.  The implication for basic aid districts is that the legislatively determined allocations 
to  school  districts,  and  other  politically  determined  factors,  are  less  significant  in  determining  their 
primary  funding  sources.    Rather,  property  tax  growth  and  the  local  economy  are  the  primary 
determinants.  The District does not currently qualify as a basic aid district. 

Accountability.  Regulations adopted by the State Board of Education require that school districts 
increase or improve services for EL/LI students in proportion to the increase in funds apportioned to such 
districts on the basis of the number and concentration of such EL/LI students, and detail the conditions 
under  which  school  districts  can  use  supplemental  or  concentration  funding  on  a  school-wide  or 
district-wide basis. 

School  districts  are  also  required  to  adopt  local  control  and  accountability  plans  (“LCAPs”) 
disclosing annual goals for all students, as well as certain numerically significant student subgroups, to be 
achieved in eight areas of State priority identified by the LCFF.  LCAPs may also specify additional local 
priorities.  LCAPs must specify the actions to be taken to achieve each goal, including actions to correct 
identified  deficiencies  with  regard  to  areas  of  State priority.    LCAPs  are  required  to  be adopted  every 
three  years,  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2014-15,  and  updated  annually  thereafter.    The  State  Board  of 
Education has developed and adopted a template LCAP for use by school districts. 

 
 

 36 

 

Support and Intervention.  AB 97, as amended by SB 91, establishes a new system of support 
and  intervention  to  assist  school  districts  in  meeting  the  performance  expectations  outlined  in  their 
respective LCAPs.  School districts must adopt their LCAPs (or annual updates thereto) in tandem with 
their annual operating budgets, and not later than five days thereafter submit such LCAPs or updates to 
their  respective  county  superintendents  of  schools.    On  or  before  August  15  of  each  year,  a  county 
superintendent  may  seek  clarification  regarding  the  contents  of  a  district’s  LCAP  (or  annual  update 
thereto),  and  the  district  is  required  to  respond  to  such  a  request  within  15  days.    Within  15  days  of 
receiving  such  a  response,  the  county  superintendent  can  submit  non-binding  recommendations  for 
amending the LCAP or annual update, and such recommendations must be considered by the respective 
school district at a public hearing within 15 days.  A district’s LCAP or annual update must be approved 
by the county superintendent by October 8 of each year if the superintendent determines that (i) the LCAP 
or annual update adheres to the State template, and (ii) the district’s budgeted expenditures are sufficient 
to implement the actions and strategies outlined in the LCAP.   

A school district is required to receive additional support if its respective LCAP or annual update 
thereto  is  not  approved,  if  the  district  requests  technical  assistance  from  its  applicable  county 
superintendent, or if the district does not improve student achievement across more than one State priority 
for  one  or  more  student  subgroups.    Such  support  can  include  a  review  of  a  district’s  strengths  and 
weaknesses in the eight State priority areas, or the assignment of an academic expert to assist the district 
with identifying and implementing programs designed to improve outcomes.  Assistance may be provided 
by  the  California  Collaborative  for  Educational  Excellence,  a  state  agency  created  by  the  LCFF  and 
charged with assisting school districts with achieving the goals set forth in their LCAPs.  The State Board 
of Education has developed rubrics to assess school district performance and the need for support and 
intervention.  

The State Superintendent of Public Instruction (the “State Superintendent”) is further authorized, 
with  the  approval  of  the  State  Board  of  Education,  to  intervene  in  the  management  of  persistently 
underperforming school districts.  The State Superintendent may intervene directly or assign an academic 
trustee to act on his or her behalf.  In so doing, the State Superintendent is authorized to (i) modify a 
district’s  LCAP,  (ii)  impose  budget  revisions  designed  to  improve  student  outcomes,  and  (iii)  stay  or 
rescind  actions  of  the  local  governing  board  that  would  prevent  such  district  from  improving  student 
outcomes; provided, however, that the State Superintendent is not authorized to rescind an action required 
by a local collective bargaining agreement. 

Other  State  Sources.    In  addition  to  State  allocations  determined  pursuant  to  the  LCFF,  the 
District receives other State revenues consisting primarily of restricted revenues designed to implement 
State mandated programs.  Beginning in fiscal year 2013-14, categorical spending restrictions associated 
with a majority of State mandated programs were eliminated, and funding for these programs was folded 
into  the  LCFF.    Categorical  funding  for  certain  programs  was  excluded  from  the  LCFF,  and  school 
districts will continue to receive restricted State revenues to fund these programs. 

Other Revenue Sources 

Federal  and  Local  Sources.    The  federal  government  provides  funding  for  several  of  the 
District’s programs, including special education programs, programs under the No Child Left Behind Act, 
and specialized programs such as Drug Free Schools, Innovative Strategies, and Vocational & Applied 
Technology.  In addition, school districts may receive additional local revenues beyond local property tax 
collections, such as interest earnings, interagency services, Developer Fees (as discussed herein) and other 
local sources. 

 
 

 37 

 

Developer Fees.  The District maintains the Capital Facilities Fund, separate and apart from its 
general fund, to account for developer fees collected by the District (the “Developer Fees”).  Developer 
Fees  are  assessed  on  development  within  the  District’s  boundaries  according  to  the  following  fee 
schedule: $3.17 per square foot for single family housing, $3.36 per square foot for multi-family housing, 
and $0.54 per square foot for commercial development.  In fiscal years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15, 
the District received $1,031,613, $905,633 and $484,652 in Developer Fees, respectively.  The District 
has projected that it will receive approximately $250,000 in Developer Fees in fiscal year 2015-16. 

State Dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies 

On  December  30,  2011,  the  State  Supreme  Court  issued  its  decision  in  the  case  of  California 
Redevelopment Association v. Matosantos (“Matosantos”), finding ABX1 26, a trailer bill to the 2011-12 
State budget, to be constitutional.  As a result, all redevelopment agencies in the State ceased to exist as a 
matter of law on February 1, 2012.  The Court in Matosantos also found that ABX1 27, a companion bill 
to ABX1 26, violated the State Constitution, as amended by Proposition 22.  See “CONSTITUTIONAL 
AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS – 
Proposition 1A and Proposition 22” herein.  ABX1 27 would have permitted redevelopment agencies to 
continue operations provided their establishing cities or counties agreed to make specified payments to 
school districts and county offices of education, totaling $1.7 billion statewide.   

ABX1  26  was  modified  by  Assembly  Bill  No.  1484  (Chapter  26,  Statutes  of  2011-12)  (“AB 
1484”), which, together with ABx1 26, is referred to herein as the “Dissolution Act.”  The Dissolution 
Act  provides  that  all  rights,  powers,  duties  and  obligations  of  a  redevelopment  agency  under  the 
California Community Redevelopment Law that have not been repealed, restricted or revised pursuant to 
ABx1 26 will be vested in a successor agency, generally the county or city that authorized the creation of 
the redevelopment agency (each, a “Successor Agency”).  All property tax revenues that would have been 
allocated to a redevelopment agency, less the corresponding county auditor-controller’s cost to administer 
the allocation of property tax revenues, are now allocated to a corresponding Redevelopment Property 
Tax  Trust  Fund  (“Trust  Fund”),  to  be  used  for  the  payment  of  pass-through  payments  to  local  taxing 
entities, and thereafter to bonds of the former redevelopment agency and any “enforceable obligations” of 
the  Successor  Agency,  as  well  as  to  pay  certain  administrative  costs.   The  Dissolution  Act  defines 
“enforceable obligations” to include bonds, loans, legally required payments, judgments or settlements, 
legal binding and enforceable obligations, and certain other obligations.   

Among the various types of enforceable obligations, the first priority for payment is tax allocation 
bonds issued by the former redevelopment agency; second is revenue bonds, which may have been issued 
by the host city, but only where the tax increment revenues were pledged for repayment and only where 
other pledged revenues are insufficient to make scheduled debt service payments; third is administrative 
costs of the Successor Agency, not to exceed $250,000 in any year, to the extent such costs have been 
approved  in  an  administrative  budget;  then,  fourth  tax  revenues  in  the  Trust  Fund  in  excess  of  such 
amounts, if any, will be allocated as residual distributions to local taxing entities in the same proportions 
as  other  tax  revenues.   Moreover,  all  unencumbered  cash  and  other  assets  of  former  redevelopment 
agencies  will  also  be  allocated 
tax 
revenues.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  portion  of  this  paragraph,  the  order  of  payment  is  subject  to 
modification  in  the  event  a  Successor  Agency  timely  reports  to  the  State  Controller  and  the  State 
Department of Finance that application of the foregoing will leave the Successor Agency with amounts 
insufficient  to  make  scheduled  payments  on  enforceable  obligations.   If  the  county  auditor-controller 
verifies  that  the  Successor  Agency  will  have  insufficient  amounts  to  make  scheduled  payments  on 
enforceable obligations, it shall report its findings to the State Controller.  If the State Controller agrees 
there are insufficient funds to pay scheduled payments on enforceable obligations, the amount of such 
deficiency shall be deducted from the amount remaining to be distributed to taxing agencies, as described 

the  same  proportions  as 

taxing  entities 

to 

local 

in 

 
 

 38 

 

as  the  fourth  distribution  above,  then  from  amounts  available  to  the  Successor  Agency  to  defray 
administrative costs.  In addition, if a taxing agency entered into an agreement pursuant to Health and 
Safety Code Section 33401 for payments from a redevelopment agency under which the payments were 
to  be  subordinated  to  certain  obligations  of  the  redevelopment  agency,  such  subordination  provisions 
shall continue to be given effect. 

As  noted  above,  the  Dissolution  Act  expressly  provides  for  continuation  of  pass-through 
payments to local taxing entities, including the District.  Per statute, 100% of contractual and statutory 
two  percent  pass-throughs,  and  56.7%  of  statutory  pass-throughs  authorized  under  the  Community 
Redevelopment Law Reform Act of 1993 (AB 1290, Chapter 942, Statutes of 1993) (“AB 1290”), are 
restricted to educational facilities without offset against apportionments by the State.  Only 43.3% of AB 
1290 pass-throughs are offset against State aid so long as the District uses the moneys received for land 
acquisition,  facility  construction,  reconstruction,  or  remodeling,  or  deferred  maintenance  as  provided 
under Education Code Section 42238(h).  

ABX1 26 states that in the future, pass-throughs shall be made in the amount “which would have 
been received had the redevelopment agency existed at that time,” and that the County Auditor-Controller 
shall  “determine  the  amount  of  property  taxes  that  would  have  been  allocated  to  each  redevelopment 
agency had the redevelopment agency not been dissolved pursuant to the operation of ABX1 26 using 
current assessed values and pursuant to statutory [pass-through] formulas and contractual agreements with 
other taxing agencies.” 

Successor Agencies continue to operate until all enforceable obligations have been satisfied and 
all remaining assets of the Successor Agency have been disposed of.  AB 1484 provides that once the 
debt  of  the  Successor  Agency  is  paid  off  and  remaining  assets  have  been  disposed  of,  the  Successor 
Agency shall terminate its existence and all pass-through payment obligations shall cease. 

The District can make no representations as to the extent to which apportionments from the State 
may  be  offset  by  the  future  receipt  of  residual  distributions  or  from  unencumbered  cash  and  assets  of 
former  redevelopment  agencies  or  any  other  surplus  property  tax  revenues  pursuant  to  the  Dissolution 
Act. 

Budget Process 

State  Budgeting  Requirements.    The  District  is  required  by  provisions  of  the  State  Education 
Code to maintain a balanced budget each year, in which the sum of expenditures and the ending fund 
balance cannot exceed the sum of revenues and the carry-over fund balance from the previous year.  The 
State Department of Education imposes a uniform budgeting and accounting format for school districts.  
The budget process for school districts was substantially amended by Assembly Bill 1200 (“AB 1200”), 
which became State law on October 14, 1991.  Portions of AB 1200 are summarized below.  Additional 
amendments to the budget process were made by Assembly Bill 2585, effective as of September 9, 2014, 
including the elimination of the dual budget cycle option for school districts. All school districts  must 
now be on a single budget cycle. 

School  districts  must  adopt  a  budget  on  or  before  July  1  of  each  year.    The  budget  must  be 
submitted to the county superintendent within five days of adoption or by July 1, whichever occurs first.  
The county superintendent will examine the adopted budget for compliance with the standards and criteria 
adopted by the State Board of Education and identify technical corrections necessary to bring the budget 
into compliance, and will determine if the budget allows the district to meet its current obligations, if the 
budget  is  consistent  with  a  financial  plan  that  will  enable  the  district  to  meet  its  multi-year  financial 
commitments,  whether  the  budget  includes  the  expenditures  necessary  to  implement  a  LCAP,  and 

 
 

 39 

 

whether  the  budget’s  ending  fund  balance  exceeds  the  minimum  recommended  reserve  for  economic 
uncertainties. 

On  or  before  August  15,  the  county  superintendent  will  approve,  conditionally  approve  or 
disapprove the adopted budget for each school district.  Budgets will be disapproved if they fail the above 
standards.    The  district  board  must  be  notified  by  August  15  of  the  county  superintendent’s 
recommendations  for  revision  and  reasons  for  the  recommendations.    The  county  superintendent  may 
assign  a  fiscal  advisor  or  appoint  a  committee  to  examine  and  comment  on  the  superintendent’s 
recommendations.    The  committee  must  report  its  findings  no  later  than  August  20.    Any 
recommendations made by the county superintendent must be made available by the district for public 
inspection.  No later than September 22, the county superintendent must notify the State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction of all school districts whose budget may be disapproved. 

A  school  district  whose  budget  has  been  disapproved  must  revise  and  readopt  its  budget  by 
September 8, reflecting changes in projected income and expense since July 1, including responding to 
the county superintendent’s recommendations.  The county superintendent must determine if the budget 
conforms  with  the  standards  and  criteria  applicable  to  final  school  district  budgets  and  not  later  than 
October  8,  must  approve  or  disapprove  the  revised  budgets.    If  the  budget  is  disapproved,  the  county 
superintendent  will  call  for  the  formation  of  a  budget  review  committee  pursuant  to  Education  Code 
Section 42127.1.  No later than October 8, the county superintendent must notify the State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction of all school districts whose budget has been disapproved.  Until a school district’s 
budget is approved, the school district will operate on the lesser of its proposed budget for the current 
fiscal year or the last budget adopted and reviewed for the prior fiscal year. 

Interim Financial Reporting.  Under the provisions of AB 1200, each school district is required to 
file  interim  certifications  with  the  county  office  of  education  as  to  its  ability  to  meet  its  financial 
obligations  for  the  remainder  of  the  then-current  fiscal  year  and,  based  on  current  forecasts,  for  the 
subsequent two fiscal years.  The county office of education reviews the certification and issues either a 
positive, negative or qualified certification.  A positive certification is assigned to any school district that 
will meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and subsequent two fiscal years.  A negative 
certification is assigned to any school district that will be unable to meet its financial obligations for the 
remainder of the current fiscal year or the subsequent fiscal year.  A qualified certification is assigned to 
any  school  district  that  may  not  meet  its  financial  obligations  for  the  current  fiscal  year  or  the  two 
subsequent fiscal years. 

The  District  has  never  had  an  adopted  budget  disapproved  by  the  County  Superintendent  of 
Schools, nor has it received a negative or qualified certification on any of its interim financial reports.  For 
all interim reporting periods, the District has designated, and the County office of education has accepted, 
its interim financial reports as “positive.” 

General  Fund  Budgeting Trends.    The  table  on  the  following  page  summarizes  the  District’s 
combined  restricted  and  unrestricted  general  fund  budgets  for  fiscal  years  2012-13  through  2015-16, 
audited ending results for fiscal years 2012-13 through 2014-15, and projected ending results for fiscal 
year 2015-16.

Accounting Practices 

The  accounting  policies  of  the  District  conform  to  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in 
accordance  with  policies  and  procedures  of  the  California  School  Accounting  Manual.    This  manual, 
according to Section 41010 of the State Education Code, is to be followed by all State school districts.    
Revenues are recognized in the period in which they become both measurable and available to finance 
expenditures of the current fiscal period.  Expenditures are recognized in the period in which the liability 
is incurred. 

State Budget Measures 

The  following  information  concerning  the  State’s  budgets  has  been  obtained  from  publicly 
available information which the District believes to be reliable; however, the District does not guarantee 
the accuracy or completeness of this information and has not independently verified such information.  
Furthermore, it should not be inferred from the inclusion of this information herein that the principal of 
or interest on the Bonds is payable from the general fund of the District.  The Bonds are payable solely 
from  the  proceeds  of  an  ad  valorem  property  tax  required  to  be  levied  by  the  County  in  an  amount 
sufficient for the payment thereof.   

2015-16 Budget.  On June 24, 2015, the Governor signed into law the State budget for fiscal year 
2015-16  (the  “2015-16  Budget”).    The  following  information  is  drawn  from  the  State  Department  of 
Finance’s summary of the 2015-16 Budget, as well as a summary prepared by the LAO. 

For fiscal year 2014-15, the 2015-16 Budget projects total State general fund revenues of $111.3 
billion, and total State general fund expenditures of $114.5 billion.  The 2015-16 Budget projects that the 
State will end the 2014-15 fiscal year with a general fund ending balance of $2.4 billion and total reserves 
of $3 billion (including $1.5 billion in the traditional general reserve and $1.6 billion in the BSA).  For 
fiscal year 2015-16, the 2015-16 Budget projects total State general fund revenues of $115 billion and 
total  expenditures  of  $115.4  billion,  leaving  the  State  with  a  year-end  general  fund  balance  of 
approximately $2 billion.  The 2015-16 Budget projects total year-end reserves of $4.6 billion, including 
$1.1 billion in the traditional general fund reserve and $3.5 billion in the BSA. 

As  a  result  of  higher  than  anticipated  State  revenues,  the  2015-16  Budget  includes  revised 
estimates to the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantees for fiscal years 2013-14 and 2014-15.  The 
2013-14  minimum  guarantee  is  revised  upward  to  $58.9  billion,  an  increase  of  $612  million  over  the 
estimate included in the 2014-15 State budget.  For fiscal year 2014-15, the 2015-16 Budget revises the 
minimum guarantee upward to $66.3 billion, an increase of $5.4 billion over the estimate included in the 
2014-15 State budget. 

The 2015-16 Budget sets the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee for fiscal year 2015-16 
at $68.4 billion, including $49.4 billion of support from the State general fund.  This represents a year-to-
year increase of $2.1 billion over the revised level for fiscal year 2014-15.  For K-12 education, the 2015-
16 Budget provides total Proposition 98 funding of $59.5 billion, including $43.2 billion from the State 
general fund.  Under the 2015-16 Budget, K-12 per-pupil spending in fiscal year 2015-16 is $9,942, an 
increase of $1,011 (or 11%) from the prior year. 

 
 

 45 

 

 
 

Significant features of the 2015-16 Budget related to K-12 education include the following: 

  Local  Control  Funding  Formula  –  An  increase  of  $6  billion  in  Proposition  98  funding  to 
continue  the  transition  to  the  LCFF,  bringing  total  LCFF  funding  to  $52  billion.    This 
represents  a  13%  year-to-year  increase,  and  is  projected  to  close  the  remaining  funding 
implementation  gap  between  the  prior  year  and  the  LCFF  target  levels  by  approximately 
52%.  As a result, the adjusted 2015-16 Base Grants are as follows: (i) $7,820 for grades K-3, 
(ii) $7,189 for grades 4-6, (iii) $7,403 for grades 7-8, and (iv) $8,801 for grades 9-12.  See 
also “– State Funding of Education – Local Control Funding Formula” herein. 

  Career Technical Education (CTE) – The 2015-16 Budget establishes the Career Technical 
Education Incentive Grant Program for local education agencies to establish new or expand 
high-quality CTE programs.  The 2015-16 Budget provides $400 million in fiscal year 2015-
16 to fund the program, as well as $300 million and $200 million for fiscal years 2016-17 and 
2017-18,  respectively.    The  program  allocates  this  funding  into  three  pools  for  large, 
medium-sized and small applicants, based on ADA in grades 7-12.  Specifically, 4% of total 
funding is available for agencies with less than 140 ADA, 8% is available for agencies with 
ADAs  between  140  and  550,  and  the  remainder  for  agencies  with  more  than  550  ADA.  
Local education agencies will be required to provide local-to-state matching funds in each of 
the three years.  When determining grant recipients, the State Department of Education will 
be required to give priority to those agencies that are establishing new programs, serve a large 
number of EL, LI and foster youth students, serve pupil groups with above-average dropout 
rates, or are located in areas of high unemployment. 

  K-14 Deferrals – $992 million to eliminate all outstanding apportionment deferrals, including 
$897  million  for  K-12  education,  consistent  with  a  revenue-based  trigger  mechanism 
included in the 2014-15 State budget.  

  Maintenance  Factor/Settle  Up  Payments  –  The  2015-16  Budget  reduces  the  outstanding 
Proposition  98  maintenance  factor  to  $772  million.    The  maintenance  factor  is  created  in 
years where the State provides less growth in K-14 funding than growth in the State economy 
by  implementing  “Test  3”  or  suspends  the  guarantee  entirely.    The  2015-16  Budget  also 
provides  $256  million  in  “settle  up”  payments  to  repay  obligations  created  in  years  where 
revenue projections understate the minimum funding guarantee.   

  Educator  Support  –  An  increase  of  $500  million  in  one-time  Proposition  98  funding  for 
educator  support,  including  beginning  teacher  and  administrator  support,  mentoring  and 
professional development.  These funds will be allocated to local educational agencies in an 
equal amount per certificated staff and are available for expenditure over the next three fiscal 
years.  

  Special  Education  –  $60.1  million  of  Proposition  98  funding,  including  $50.1  million  of 
ongoing  funding  and  $10  million  of  one-time  funds,  to  implement  selected  programmatic 
changes 
implement 
recommendations  issued  by  a  State  taskforce  formed  in  2013,  as  well  as  to  make  targeted 
investments designed to improve the delivery of services and outcomes for disabled students. 

in  special  education  services. 

to 

  The  changes  are 

intended 

  K-12 High- Speed Internet Access – An increase of $50 million in one-time Proposition 98 

funding to support additional internet connectivity and infrastructure.  

 46 

 

  Mandates  –  An  increase  of  $3.2  billion  in  one-time  Proposition  98  funding  to  reduce  a 
backlog of unpaid reimbursement claims to K-12 local educational agencies for the cost of 
State-mandated programs.  After accounting for this payment, the outstanding K-12 mandate 
backlog is approximately $1.2 billion. 

  Adult  Education  –  $500  million  to  fund  the  Adult  Education  Block  Grant  program.    Prior 
budgetary  legislation  mandated  the  establishment  of  regional  adult  education  consortia 
composed of school districts, community college districts and certain other stakeholders to 
coordinate  the  delivery  of  adult  education  services.    Up  to  $375  million  is  available  to  be 
distributed directly to K-12 school districts and county offices of education to match amounts 
that  have  been  spent  on  adult  education  within  the  past  two  years.    The  balance  will  be 
apportioned  directly  to  consortia  for  distribution  to  their  member  agencies.    Beginning  in 
fiscal year 2016-17, all funds for adult education will be apportioned directly to consortia.  
The 2015-16 Budget also provides $25 million in one-time Proposition 98 funding to assist 
consortia  develop  or  update  data  systems    necessary  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  their 
programs, as well as to fund State-level activities to develop consistent data policies and data 
collection procedures. 

  Categorical Programs – The 2015-16 Budget provides $40 million to fund a 1.02% COLA 

for select K-12 categorical programs. 

  Emergency Repair Program – $273 million to make the final payment towards funding the 
Emergency Repair Program, which was created as the result of a legal settlement in 2004 to 
provide local educational agencies funding for critical repair projects.   

  Basic Skills Pilot Program – $10 million of Proposition 98 funding to support a pilot program 
designed  to  incentivize  high  schools,  community  college  districts  and  the  California  State 
University  system  to  coordinate  the  delivery  of  basic  skills  instruction  to  incoming  CSU 
students. 

  Special  Education  –  $67  million  to  fund  a  package  of  special-education  related  activities, 

including $52 million in ongoing funding and $15 million in one-time funds. 

For additional information regarding the 2015-16 Budget, see the State Department of Finance 
website  at  www.dof.ca.gov  and  the  LAO’s  website  at  www.lao.ca.gov.    However,  the  information 
presented on such websites is not incorporated herein by reference. 

Proposed 2016-17 Budget.  On January 7, 2016, the Governor released his proposed State budget 
for  fiscal  year  2016-17  (the  “Proposed  Budget”).    The  following  information  is  drawn  from  the  State 
Department of Finance’s summary of the Proposed Budget. 

The  Proposed  Budget  assumes,  for  fiscal  year  2015-16,  total  general  fund  revenues  of  $121.2 
billion and total expenditures of $116.1 billion.  The State is projected to end the 2015-16 fiscal year with 
a general fund surplus of $4.2 billion.  The Proposed Budget also projects a year-end balance in the BSA 
of  $4.5  billion.    For  fiscal  year  2016-17,  the  Proposed  Budget  assumes  total  general  fund  revenues  of 
$125.8 billion and authorizes  expenditures of $122.6 billion.  The State is projected to end fiscal year 
2016-17 with a general fund surplus of $2.2 billion.  The Proposed Budget projects that the BSA balance 
will  grow  by  approximately  $1.6  billion  as  a  result  of  projected  increases  to  State  revenues.    The 
Proposed Budget also authorizes an additional deposit of $2 billion, bringing the total balance of the BSA 
to $8 billion by the end of fiscal year 2016-17.       

 
 

 47 

 

The Proposed Budget provides for retroactive increases to the Proposition 98 minimum funding 
guarantee for fiscal years 2014-15 and 2015-16 of $400 million and $800 million, respectively.  For fiscal 
year  2016-17,  the  Proposed  Budget  sets  the  minimum  funding  guarantee  at  $71.6  billion.    Ongoing 
Proposition 98 per-pupil expenditures in fiscal year 2016-17 are set at $10,591, reflecting an increase of 
$368 above the revised prior-year level.         

Significant  proposals  or  adjustments  with  respect  to  K-12  education  funding  include  the 

following: 

  Local Control Funding Formula.  $2.8 billion of Proposition 98 funding to school districts 
and charter schools to continue the implementation of the LCFF, an increase of 5.4% from 
the prior fiscal year.  This amount is estimated to close approximately 50% of the remaining 
funding  gap  between  fiscal  year  2013-14  funding  levels  and  the  LCFF  target  rates.    As  a 
result, the Proposed Budget projects total LCFF formula implementation to be at 95%.  The 
Proposed Budget also provides $1.7 million to support a COLA to LCFF funding levels for 
county offices of education.       
 

  Early  Education  Block  Grant.    $1.6  billion  to  fund  a  block  grant  for  local  educational 
agencies that combines existing Proposition 98 grant funding for three statewide programs: 
the State Preschool Program, Transitional Kindergarten and the Preschool Quality Rating and 
Improvement  System  Grant.    Block  grant  funds  will  be  distributed  based  on  factors  such 
population  and  equity  amongst  schools  with  large  populations  of  disadvantaged  children.  
However, no local educational agency will receive less funding under this block grant than it 
received under prior funding models. 

  Discretionary Funding – Approximately $1.2 billion in one-time Proposition 98 funding for 
school districts, charter schools and county offices of education to be used at local discretion.  
These  funds  will  also  offset  any  applicable  reimbursements  claims  for  the  cost  of  State-
mandated programs. 

  Charter  Schools  –  An  increase  of  $61  million  in  Proposition  98  funding  to  support  a 
projected growth in charter school ADA.  The Proposed Budget also provides $20 million of 
one-time funds to support operational startup costs for new charter schools in 2016 and 2017, 
to offset the loss of federal funding previously available for this purpose. 

  Categorical Programs –$22.9 million in Proposition 98 funding to support a 0.47% COLA 

for select K-12 categorical programs that remain outside the LCFF. 

  Special  Education  –  A  decrease  of  $15.5  million  in  Proposition  98  funding  for  special 

education, as a result of a projected decrease in special education ADA. 

  Proposition  39  –  Passed  by  voters  in  November  2012,  Proposition  39  increases  State 
corporate tax revenues and requires that, for a five-year period starting in fiscal year 2013-14, 
a  portion  of  these  additional  revenues  be  used  allocated  to  local  education  agencies  to 
improve energy efficiency and expand the use of alternative energy in public buildings.  The 
Proposed Budget allocates $365.4 million of such funds to support school district and charter 
school energy efficiency projects. 

 
 

 48 

 

  Truancy and Dropout Prevention – Proposition 47, approved by voters in November 2014, 
reduces  penalties  for  certain  non-serious  and  non-violent  property  and  drug  offenses,  and 
requires  that  State  expenditures  savings  resulting  from  these  reduced  penalties  by  invested 
into K-12 truancy and dropout prevention.  The Proposed Budget allocates $7.3 million of 
such funding to K-12 local education agencies. 

  Behavioral  Supports  –  $30  million  in  one-time  Proposition  98  funding  to  assist  local 

educational agencies provide coordinated academic and behavioral support systems. 

For additional information regarding the Proposed Budget, see the State Department of Finance 
website  at  www.dof.ca.gov.    However,  the  information  presented  on  such  website  is  not  incorporated 
herein by reference. 

Future  Actions.    The  District  cannot  predict  what  actions  will  be  taken  in  the  future  by  the 
Legislature  and  the  Governor  to  address  changing  State  revenues  and  expenditures.    The  District  also 
cannot predict the impact such actions will have on State revenues available in the current or future years 
for education.  The State  budget will be affected by national and State economic conditions and other 
factors over which the District will have no control.  Certain actions or results could produce a significant 
shortfall of revenue and cash, and could consequently impair the State’s ability to fund school districts.  
State budget shortfalls in future fiscal years may also have an adverse financial impact on the financial 
condition  of  the  District.    However,  the  obligation  to  levy ad  valorem  property  taxes  upon  all  taxable 
property  within  the  District  for  the  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  would  not  be 
impaired. 

BONITA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 

The  information  in  this  section  concerning  the  operations  of  the  District  and  the  District’s 
finances is provided as supplementary information only, and it should not be inferred from the inclusion 
of this information in this Official Statement that the principal of or interest on the Bonds is payable from 
the  general  fund  of  the  District.    The  Bonds  are  payable  solely  from  the  proceeds  of  an  ad  valorem 
property tax required to be levied by the County in an amount sufficient for the payment thereof.  See 
“THE BONDS – Security and Sources of Payment” herein.

Labor Relations 

As of July 1, 2015 the District employed 515.86 full-time equivalent certificated employees and 
387.12  full-time  equivalent  classified  employees.    These  employees,  except  management  and  some 
part-time employees, are represented by the two bargaining units as noted below:

The  information  set  forth  below  regarding  the  District’s  retirement  programs,  other  than  the 
information provided by the District regarding its annual contributions thereto, has been obtained from 
publicly available sources which are believed to be reliable but are not guaranteed as to accuracy or 
completeness,  and  should  not  to  be  construed  as  a  representation  by  either  the  District  or  the 
Underwriter.      

STRS.  All full-time certificated employees, as well as certain classified employees, are members 
of the State Teachers’ Retirement System (“STRS”).  STRS provides retirement, disability and survivor 
benefits to plan members and beneficiaries under a defined benefit program (the “STRS Defined Benefit 
Program”).  The STRS Defined Benefit Program is funded through a combination of investment earnings 
and  statutorily  set  contributions  from  three  sources:  employees,  employers,  and  the  State.    Benefit 
provisions and contribution amounts are established by State statutes, as legislatively amended from time 
to time. 

 
 

 51 

 

Prior to fiscal year 2014-15, and unlike typical defined benefit programs, neither the employee, 
employer nor State contribution rates to the STRS Defined Benefit Program varied annually to make up 
funding  shortfalls  or  assess  credits  for  actuarial  surpluses.    In  recent  years,  the  combined  employer, 
employee and State contributions to the STRS Defined Benefit Program have not been sufficient to pay 
actuarially required amounts.  As a result, and due to significant investment losses, the unfunded actuarial 
liability  of  the  STRS  Defined  Benefit  Program  has  increased  significantly  in  recent  fiscal  years.    In 
September 2013, STRS projected that the STRS Defined Benefit Program would be depleted in 31 years 
assuming existing contribution rates continued, and other significant actuarial assumptions were realized.  
In an effort to reduce the unfunded actuarial liability of the STRS Defined Benefit Program, the State 
recently passed the legislation described below to increase contribution rates. 

Prior to July 1, 2014, K-14 school districts were required by such statutes to contribute 8.25% of 
eligible  salary  expenditures,  while  participants  contributed  8%  of  their  respective  salaries.    On 
June 24, 2014, the Governor signed AB 1469 (“AB 1469”) into law as a part of the State’s fiscal year 
2014-15 budget.  AB 1469 seeks to fully fund the unfunded actuarial obligation with respect to service 
credited to members of the STRS Defined Benefit Program before July 1, 2014 (the “2014 Liability”), 
within  32  years,  by  increasing  member,  K-14  school  district  and  State  contributions  to  STRS.  
Commencing July 1, 2014, the employee contribution rate will increase over a three-year phase-in period 
in accordance with the following schedule:

Based upon the recommendation from its actuary, for fiscal year 2021-22 and each fiscal year 
thereafter the STRS Teachers’ Retirement Board (the “STRS Board”), is required to increase or decrease 
the K-14 school districts’ contribution rate to reflect the contribution required to eliminate the remaining 
2014 Liability by June 30, 2046; provided that the rate cannot change in any fiscal year by more than 1% 
of creditable compensation upon which members’ contributions to the STRS Defined Benefit Program are 

 
 

 52 

 

based; and provided further that such contribution rate cannot exceed a maximum of 20.25%.  In addition 
to the increased contribution rates discussed above, AB 1469 also requires the STRS Board to report to 
the Legislature every five years (commencing with a report due on or before July 1, 2019) on the fiscal 
health of the STRS Defined Benefit Program and the unfunded actuarial obligation with respect to service 
credited  to  members  of  that  program  before  July  1,  2014.    The  reports  are  also  required  to  identify 
adjustments required in contribution rates for K-14 school districts and the State in order to eliminate the 
2014 Liability. 

The  District’s  contributions  to  STRS  were  $3,031,217  for  fiscal  year  2012-13,  $3,275,045  for 
fiscal year 2013-14, and $3,855,528 for fiscal year 2014-15.  The District has projected a contribution of 
$5,010,877 to STRS for fiscal year 2015-16. 

The State also contributes to STRS, currently in an amount equal to 4.891% of teacher payroll for 
fiscal  year  2015-16.    The  State’s  contribution  reflects  a  base  contribution  rate  of  2.017%,  and  a 
supplemental contribution rate that will vary from year to year based on statutory criteria.  Pursuant to AB 
1469, the State contribution rate will increase over a three-year period to a total of 6.328% in fiscal year 
2016-17.  Based upon the recommendation from its actuary, for fiscal year 2017-18 and each fiscal year 
thereafter,  the  STRS  Board  is  required,  with  certain  limitations,  to  increase  or  decrease  the  State’s 
contribution rates to reflect the contribution required to eliminate the unfunded actuarial accrued liability 
attributed to benefits in effect before July 1, 1990.  In addition, the State is currently required to make an 
annual  general  fund  contribution  up  to  2.5%  of  the  fiscal  year  covered  STRS  member  payroll  to  the 
Supplemental  Benefit  Protection  Account  (the  “SBPA”),  which  was  established  by  statute  to  provide 
supplemental payments to beneficiaries whose purchasing power has fallen below 85% of the purchasing 
power of their initial allowance.  

PERS.    Classified  employees  working  four  or  more  hours  per  day  are  members  of  the  Public 
Employees’  Retirement  System  (“PERS”).    PERS  provides  retirement  and  disability  benefits,  annual 
COLA’s, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries.  Benefit provisions are established by the 
State statutes, as legislatively amended from time to time.  PERS operates a number of retirement plans 
including  the  Public  Employees  Retirement  Fund  (“PERF”).    PERF  is  a  multiple-employer  defined 
benefit retirement plan.  In addition to the State, employer participants at June 30, 2014 included 1,580 
public agencies and 1,513 K-14 school districts.  PERS acts as the common investment and administrative 
agent for the member agencies.  The State and K-14 school districts (for “classified employees,” which 
generally consist of school employees other than teachers) are required by law to participate in PERF.  
Employees participating in PERF generally become fully vested in their retirement benefits earned to date 
after  five  years  of  credited  service.    One  of  the  plans  operated  by  PERS  is  for  K-14  school  districts 
throughout the State (the “Schools Pool”). 

Contributions  by  employers  to  the  Schools  Pool  are  based  upon  an  actuarial  rate  determined 
annually and contributions by plan members vary based upon their date of hire.  The District is currently 
required  to  contribute  to  PERS  at  an  actuarially  determined  rate,  which  is  11.847%  of  eligible  salary 
expenditures for fiscal year 2015-16.  Participants enrolled in PERS prior to January 1, 2013 contribute 
7%  of  their  respective  salaries,  while  participants  enrolled  after  January  1,  2013  contribute  at  an 
actuarially  determined  rate,  which  is  6%  of  their  respective  salaries  for  fiscal  year  2015-16.    See  “—
California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013” herein. 

The  District’s  contributions  to  PERS  were  $1,297,555  for  fiscal  year  2012-13,  $1,362,426  for 
fiscal year 2013-14, and $1,611,055 for fiscal year 2014-15.  The District has projected a contribution of 
$1,868,619 to PERS for fiscal year 2015-16.

State Pension Trusts.  Each of STRS and PERS issues a separate comprehensive financial report 
that  includes  financial  statements  and  required  supplemental  information.    Copies  of  such  financial 
reports  may  be  obtained  from  each  of  STRS  and  PERS  as  follows:  (i)  STRS,  P.O.  Box  15275, 
Sacramento, California 95851-0275; (ii) PERS, P.O. Box 942703, Sacramento, California 94229-2703.  
Moreover,  each  of  STRS  and  PERS  maintains  a  website,  as  follows:  (i)  STRS:  www.calstrs.com; 
(ii) PERS: www.calpers.ca.gov.  However, the information presented in such financial reports or on such 
websites is not incorporated into this Official Statement by any reference.   

Both  STRS  and  PERS  have  substantial  statewide  unfunded  liabilities.    The  amount  of  these 
unfunded liabilities will vary depending on actuarial assumptions, returns on investments, salary scales 
and  participant  contributions. 
the 
actuarially-determined accrued liability for both STRS and PERS.  Actuarial assessments are “forward-
looking” information that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the pension plans, and are based upon 
a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may not materialize or be changed in the future.  Actuarial 
assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

According to the STRS Defined Benefit Program Actuarial Valuation, as of June 30, 2014, the 
future  revenue  from  contributions  and  appropriations  for  the  STRS  Defined  Benefit  Program  was 
projected  to  be  sufficient  to  finance  its  obligations.    This  finding  reflects  the  scheduled  contribution 
increases  specified  in  AB  1469  and  is  based  on  the  valuation  assumptions  and  the  valuation  policy 
adopted by the STRS Board. 

In recent years, the PERS Board of Administration (the “PERS Board”) has taken several steps, 
as described below, intended to reduce the amount of the unfunded accrued actuarial liability of its plans, 
including the Schools Pool. 

On March 14, 2012, the PERS Board voted to lower the PERS’ rate of expected price inflation 
and its investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses) (the “PERS Discount Rate”) from 7.75% 
to 7.5%.  As one consequence of such decrease, the annual contribution amounts paid by PERS member 
public agencies, including the District, have been increased by 1 to 2% for miscellaneous plans and by 2 
to 3% for safety plans beginning in fiscal year 2013-14.  On February 18, 2014, the PERS Board voted to 
keep the PERS Discount Rate unchanged at 7.5%.  On November 17, 2015, the PERS Board voted to 
reduce the PERS Discount Rate to 6.5% over a period of 20 years.  This change could result in increased 
contributions over time from both employers and employees 

On April 17, 2013, the PERS Board approved new actuarial policies aimed at returning PERS to 
fully-funded status within 30 years.  The policies include a rate smoothing method with a 30-year fixed 
amortization  period  for  gains  and  losses,  a  five-year  increase  of  public  agency  contribution  rates, 
including the contribution rate at the onset of such amortization period, and a five year reduction of public 
agency contribution rates at the end of such amortization period.  The new actuarial policies were first 
included  in  the  June  30,  2014  actuarial  valuation  and  were  implemented  with  respect  the  State,  K-14 
school districts and all other public agencies in fiscal year 2015-16. 

Also, on February 20, 2014, the PERS Board approved new demographic assumptions reflecting 
(i)  expected  longer  life  spans  of  public  agency  employees  and  related  increases  in  costs  for  the  PERS 
system and (ii) trends of higher rates of retirement for certain public agency employee classes, including 
police officers and firefighters.  The new actuarial assumptions will first be reflected in the Schools Pool 
in the June 30, 2015 actuarial valuation.  The increase in liability due to the new assumptions will be 
amortized  over  20  years  with  increases  phased  in  over  five  years,  beginning  with  the  contribution 
requirement for fiscal year 2016-17.  The new demographic assumptions affect the State, K-14 school 
districts and all other public agencies. 

The  District  can  make  no  representations  regarding  the  future  program  liabilities  of  STRS,  or 
whether the District will be required to make additional contributions to STRS in the future above those 
amounts required under AB 1469.  The District can also provide no assurances that the District’s required 
contributions to PERS will not increase in the future. 

California  Public  Employees’  Pension  Reform  Act  of  2013.    On  September  12,  2012,  the 
Governor signed into law the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (the “Reform 
Act”), which makes changes to both STRS and PERS, most substantially affecting new employees hired 
after January 1, 2013 (the “Implementation Date”).  For STRS participants hired after the Implementation 
Date, the Reform Act changes the normal retirement age by increasing the eligibility for the 2% age factor 
(the  age  factor  is  the  percent  of  final  compensation  to  which  an  employee  is  entitled  for  each  year  of 
service) from age 60 to 62 and increasing the eligibility of the maximum age factor of 2.4% from age 63 
to 65.  Similarly, for non-safety PERS participants hired after the Implementation Date, the Reform Act 
changes the normal retirement age by increasing the eligibility for the 2% age factor from age 55 to 62 
and increases the eligibility requirement for the maximum age factor of 2.5% to age 67. Among the other 

 
 

 55 

 

changes to PERS and STRS, the Reform Act also: (i) requires all new participants enrolled in PERS and 
STRS after the Implementation Date to contribute at least 50% of the total annual normal cost of their 
pension benefit each year as determined by an actuary, (ii) requires STRS and PERS to determine the 
final compensation amount for employees based upon the highest annual compensation earnable averaged 
over a consecutive 36-month period as the basis for calculating retirement benefits for new participants 
enrolled  after  the  Implementation  Date  (previously  12  months  for  STRS  members  who  retire  with  25 
years  of  service),  and  (iii)  caps  “pensionable  compensation”  for  new  participants  enrolled  after  the 
Implementation Date at 100% of the federal Social Security contribution (to be adjusted annually based 
on  changes  to  the  Consumer  Price  Index  for  all  Urban  Consumers)  and  benefit  base  for  members 
participating in Social Security or 120% for members not participating in social security (to be adjusted 
annually  based  on  changes  to  the  Consumer  Price  Index  for  all  Urban  Consumers),  while  excluding 
previously  allowed  forms  of  compensation  under  the  formula  such  as  payments  for  unused  vacation, 
annual leave, personal leave, sick leave, or compensatory time off. 

GASB  Statement  Nos.  67  and  68.    On  June  25,  2012,  the  Governmental  Accounting  Standards 
Board  (“GASB”)  approved  two  new  standards  (“Statements”)  with  respect  to  pension  accounting  and 
financial reporting standards for state and local governments and pension plans. The new Statements, No. 
67 and No. 68, will replace GASB Statement No. 27 and most of Statements  No. 25 and No. 50. The 
changes  will  impact  the  accounting  treatment  of  pension  plans  in  which  state  and  local  governments 
participate. Major changes include:  (1) the inclusion of unfunded pension liabilities on the government’s 
balance  sheet  (currently,  such  unfunded  liabilities  are  typically  included  as  notes  to  the  government’s 
financial statements); (2) more components of full pension costs being shown as expenses regardless of 
actual contribution levels; (3) lower actuarial discount rates being required to be used for  underfunded 
plans  in  certain  cases  for  purposes  of  the  financial  statements;  (4) closed  amortization  periods  for 
unfunded liabilities being required to be used for certain purposes of the financial statements; and (5) the 
difference  between  expected  and  actual  investment  returns  being  recognized  over  a  closed  five-year 
smoothing period.  In addition, according to GASB, Statement No. 68 means that, for pensions within the 
scope of the Statement, a cost-sharing employer that does not have a special funding situation is required 
to recognize a net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources related 
to pensions and pension expense based on its proportionate share of the net pension liability for benefits 
provided through the pension plan.  Because the accounting standards do not require changes in funding 
policies, the full extent of the effect of the new standards on the District is not known at this time. The 
reporting requirements for pension plans took effect for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2013 and the 
reporting requirements for government employers, including the District, took effect for the fiscal year 
beginning July 1, 2014.   

The  District’s  net  pension  liabilities  for  its  proportionate  shares  of  the  net  pension  liability  of 

STRS and PERS, as of June 30, 2015, are as shown in the following table.

Other Post-Employment Benefits 

Plan  Description. 

  The  District  administers  a  single-employer  defined  benefit  other 
post-employment  benefit  plan  (the  “Plan”)  through  PERS  that  provides  medical,  dental  and  vision 
insurance  benefits  (the  “Benefits”)  for  retirees  and  their  covered  eligible  dependents.    Retirees  age  55 
with  at  least  10  years  of  service  who  were  designated  as  teachers  or  management  (certificated)  and 
retirees  age  50  with  at  least  10  years  of  service  who  were  designated  classified  or  management  (non-
teaching),  who  are  enrolled  in  one  of  the  PERS  health  plans  at  retirement,  will  be  offered  a  lifetime 
monthly subsidy from the District.  For the current year, the monthly subsidy is in the amount of $115 per 
retiree. 

Additionally, select retirees receive a lifetime subsidy equal to the actual cost of their healthcare 

benefits.  There are currently two retirees receiving this subsidy.   

As of the valuation date of the Actuarial Report (as described below), there were 154 retirees and 
beneficiaries receiving Benefits under the Plan, and 593 active Plan members not yet receiving Benefits 
under the Plan. 

Funding Policy.  The District’s funding policy is based on the projected pay-as-you-go financing 
requirements,  with  additional  amounts  to  prefund  the  Benefits  as  determined  annually  by  the  Board.  
During  fiscal  year  2014-15,  the  District  contributed  $189,307,  all  of  which  was  used  for  current 
premiums.  The District has projected a contribution of $197,000 in fiscal year 2015-16, all of which will 
be used for current premiums. 

Actuarial  Report.    The  District  has  implemented  GASB  Statement  No.  45,  Accounting  and 
Financial  Reporting  by  Employers  for  Postemployment  Benefits  Other  Than  Pensions  (“GASB  45”), 
pursuant to which the District has commissioned and received several actuarial studies of its outstanding 
liabilities with respect to the Benefits under the Plan.  The most recent of these studies (the “Actuarial 
Report”), determined that, as of a July 1, 2014 valuation date, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability (the 
“UAAL”) with respect to the Benefits was $10,805,323, and that the annual required contribution (the 
“ARC”) was $1,198,434.  The ARC is the amount that would be necessary to fund the value of future 
Benefits  earned  by  current  employees  during  each  fiscal  year  (the  “Normal  Cost”)  and  the  amount 
necessary to amortize the UAAL, in accordance with the GASB Statements Nos. 43 and 45. 

Net OPEB Obligation.  As of June 30, 2015, the District recognized a long-term obligation (the 
“Net  OPEB  Obligation”)  of  $6,834,412  with  respect  to  its  accrued  liability  for  the  Benefits  under  the 
Plan.  The Net OPEB Obligation is based on the District’s contributions towards the ARC during fiscal 
year 2014-15, plus interest on the prior year’s Net OPEB Obligation and minus any adjustments to reflect 
the amortization thereof.  See “APPENDIX B – THE 2014-15 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
OF THE DISTRICT – Note 11” attached hereto. 

Early Retirement Incentives 

Employees who reach qualifying age and have performed 10 years of service for the District are 
entitled to an annual payment for 10 years or until Medicare or Social Security retirement age is reached, 
whichever  comes  first.  The  amount  is  prorated  based  upon  the  percentage  of  full-time  employment. 
Previously the amount was $2,000 per year for certificated employees and $2,200 per year for classified 
employees.

The District has offered several early retirement incentives over the last several fiscal years.  In 
fiscal year 2007-2008, certificated employees were offered an additional $4,000 per year (for a total of 
$6,000), and classified employees were offered an additional $1,000 per year (for a total of $3,200). 

In  fiscal  year  2008-09,  certificated  employees  were  offered  one  of  two  retirement  incentives: 
(a) $6,000  per  year  for  no  more  than  10  years  ($4,000  per  year  greater  than  the  traditional  retirement 
incentive); or (b) a one-time cash payment of 20% of their annual contracted salary to be paid in fiscal 
year 2009-10, plus $2,000 per year for a maximum of 10 years or to the age of 65. Five employees chose 
option (a) above and 15 chose option (b) above.  During fiscal year 2009-10, the District extended the 
same offer as in the previous year, and 12 employees chose option (a) above, while six chose option (b) 
above. 

In  fiscal  year  2008-09,  classified  employees  were  eligible  for  a  one-time  retirement  incentive 
equal to 10% of their base salary payable in two semi-annual installments.  Additionally, such employees 
receive the $2,200 per year for 10 years or until they are eligible to receive full Social Security benefits.  
Eleven employees signed up for this incentive in fiscal year 2008-09.  In fiscal year 2009-10, the District 
extended the same offer as in the previous year.  In such year, 13 employees signed up for the incentive, 
of which four received only the 10% incentive because they had already reached full retirement age. 

In fiscal year 2011-12, certificated and classified employees were offered a retirement incentive 
of up to 25% of their annual salary if certain numbers of staff opted to retire.  Not enough classified staff 
decided to retire so they were not eligible to receive that incentive.  Twenty-three certificated staff opted 
to retire which resulted in a retirement incentive obligation at June 30.  The retirement incentive was paid 
in two installments. 

No retirement incentive was offered in fiscal year 2012-13. 

In fiscal year 2013‐14, certificated and classified employees were offered a retirement incentive 

of up to 25% of their base salary. Payments were made in two equal installments; one in October 2014 
and  one  in  March  2015.  Additionally,  certificated  employees  who  elected  to  retire  will  also  receive 
$2,000 per year, and classified employees will receive $2,200 per year, until the employee is eligible for 
social security. In total, 26 employees elected to take the incentive. 

Currently,  115  retirees  are  receiving  benefits  under  the  above-described  early  retirement 
incentives. Expenditures are recognized on a pay-as-you-go basis, as employees are paid.  The District 
budgets these benefits on an annual basis and funds them on the pay-as-you-go method.  During fiscal 
year 2014-15, expenditures of $628,816 were incurred for the early retirement incentives.  For fiscal year 
2015-16,  the  District  projects  that  it  will  incur  $846,664  of  expenditures  for  the  early  retirement 
incentives.  

The estimated future liability of the District with respect to the early retirement incentives, as of 
June 30, 2015,  was  $1,419,541.    This  figure  was  estimated  by  multiplying  the  number  of  retirees 
receiving  benefits  by  the  annual  payment  for  each  retiree  and  by  the  number  of  years  remaining  of 
eligibility.

Joint Ventures 

The  District  participates  in  joint  ventures  under  a  joint  powers  agreement  (“JPA”)  with  the 
Alliance  of  Schools  for  Cooperative  Insurance  Program  (“ASCIP”)  and  Valley  Insurance  Programs 
(“VIP”). The relationships between the District and the JPAs are such that the JPA’s are not a component 
unit of the District for financial reporting purposes.  VIP and ASCIP are governed by boards consisting of 
a  representative  from  each  member  district.  The  governing  boards  control  the  operations  of  their 
respective JPA’s independent of any influence by the member districts beyond their representation on the 
governing  board.  Each  member  district  pays  a  premium  commensurate  with  the  level  of  coverage 
requested and shares surpluses and deficits proportionately to its participation in the JPA’s. 

Risk Management 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction 
of assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees and natural disasters.  ASCIP provides for property 
and liability insurance coverage for the District.  Settled claims have not exceeded commercial coverage 
in any of the past three years, and there has not been a significant reduction in coverage from the prior 
year. 

VIP provides insurance coverage to the District for workers’ compensation up to $750,000 per 
claim self-insured retention, with excess coverage provided by VIP’s excess coverage insurance carrier, 
Hanover.   

For fiscal year 2015-16, the District has  a cap of $7,500 on employer paid health and welfare 
benefits.  The District contracts with various entities to provide employees medical and surgical benefits, 
dental benefits, and vision benefits.

 (1)   The 2008 Series A-1 Bonds are designated as “Build America Bonds” pursuant to an irrevocable election by the District to have Section 54AA and Section 54AA(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended apply thereto.  The District expects to receive a cash subsidy payment from the United States Department of the Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on such bonds on or 
about each semi-annual interest payment date (each, a “BAB Subsidy”).  This table reflects gross debt service payments with respect to the 2008 Series A-1 Bonds and does not reflect the anticipated 
receipt of the BAB Subsidy. 
(2)    Excludes  debt  service  on  the  Refunded  Bonds  expected  to  be  refunded  with  proceeds  of  the  Bonds.    Following  the  refunding  described  herein,  none  of  the  2008  Series  B  Bonds  will  remain 
outstanding. 
(3)    The 2008 Series B-1 Bonds are designated as “Qualified School Construction Bonds” pursuant to an irrevocable election by the District to have Section 54F and Section 6431 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as amended by the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010, apply thereto.  The District expects to receive a cash subsidy payment from the United 
States Department of the Treasury equal to the lesser of the (a) interest payable on such bonds on such semi-annual interest payment date or (b) amount of interest that would have been payable on such 
semi-annual interest payment date if such interest were determined at a federal tax credit rate applicable to the 2008 Series B-1 Bonds (each, a “QSCB Subsidy,” and together with the BAB Subsidy, the 
“Subsidy Payments”).  This table reflects gross debt service payments with respect to the 2008 Series B-1 Bonds and does not reflect the anticipated receipt of the QSCB Subsidy. 
(4)    The Subsidy Payments are subject to reduction (the “Sequestration Reduction”) pursuant to the federal Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, which currently 
includes provisions reducing the Subsidy Payments by 6.8% through the end of the current federal fiscal year (September 30, 2016).  In the absence of action by the United States Congress, the rate of 
the Sequestration Reduction is subject to change in the following federal fiscal year.  The District cannot predict whether or how subsequent sequestration actions may affect Subsidy Payments currently 
scheduled for receipt in future federal fiscal years.  However, notwithstanding any such reduction, the County Board of Supervisors is empowered and obligated to levy ad valorem property taxes in an 
amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the 2008 Series A-1 Bonds and 2008 Series B-1 Bonds.  The County will deposit any cash Subsidy Payments received into the respective debt 
service fund for such bonds.

Certificates  of  Participation.    On  June  14,  1993  the  District  executed  and  delivered  its 
Certificates of Participation (1993 Refunding Project) in the aggregate principal amount of $9,558,832.35 
(the  “1993  Certificates”).    The  1993  Certificates  were  executed  and  delivered  in  the  form  of  current 
interest  certificates  (the  “1993  Current  Interest  Certificates”)  and  capital  appreciation  certificates  (the 
“1993  Capital  Appreciation  Certificates”).    On  July  29,  2003,  the  District  executed  and  delivered  its 
Refunding Certificates of Participation (Series 2003) in the aggregate principal amount of $5,020,000 (the 
“2003 Certificates”), the proceeds of which were used to prepay the 1993 Current Interest Certificates.  
The 2003 Certificates have since matured.  The following table summarizes the District’s annual payment 
obligations with regard to the outstanding 1993 Capital Appreciation Certificates.

New Clean Renewable Energy Bond.  The District has submitted an application to the Internal 
Revenue  Service  for  a  New  Clean  Renewable  Energy  Bond  (“CREB”)  allocation  pursuant  to  Section 
54C(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  If granted the CREB allocation, the District 
expects to enter into a lease agreement in an aggregate principal amount not-to-exceed $15,000,000 to 
finance solar energy projects at the District. 

TAX MATTERS 

In  the  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel,  under  existing  statutes,  regulations,  rulings  and  judicial 
decisions, and assuming the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants 
and  requirements  described  herein,  interest  on  the  Bonds  is  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal 
income tax purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of calculating the federal alternative 
minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations.  In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest 
on  the  Bonds  is  exempt  from  State  personal  income  tax.    Bond  Counsel  notes  that,  with  respect  to 

 
 

63 

 

corporations,  interest  on  the  Bonds  may  be  included  as  an  adjustment  in  the  calculation  of  alternative 
minimum taxable income which may affect the alternative minimum tax liability of corporations.   

The difference between the issue price of a Bond (the first price at which a substantial amount of 
the Bonds of the same series and maturity is to be sold to the public) and the stated redemption price at 
maturity  with  respect  to  such  Bond  constitutes  original  issue  discount.  Original  issue  discount  accrues 
under a constant yield method, and original issue discount will accrue to a Bond Owner before receipt of 
cash attributable to such excludable income. The amount of original issue discount deemed received by 
the Bond Owner will increase the Bond Owner’s basis in the Bond.  In the opinion of Bond Counsel, the 
amount of original issue discount that accrues to the owner of the Bond is excluded from the gross income 
of such owner for federal income tax purposes, is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal 
alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  individuals  and  corporations,  and  is  exempt  from  State  personal 
income tax.   

Bond  Counsel’s  opinion  as  to  the  exclusion  from  gross  income  of  interest  (and  original  issue 
discount)  on  the  Bonds  is  based  upon  certain  representations  of  fact  and  certifications  made  by  the 
District and others and is subject to the condition that the District complies with all requirements of the 
Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  “Code”),  that  must  be  satisfied  subsequent  to  the 
issuance of the Bonds to assure that interest (and original issue discount) on the Bonds will not become 
includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes.  Failure to comply with such requirements of 
the  Code  might  cause  the  interest  (and  original  issue  discount)  on  the  Bonds  to  be  included  in  gross 
income for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds.  The District has 
covenanted to comply with all such requirements. 

The amount by which a Bond Owner’s original basis for determining loss on sale or exchange in 
the applicable Bond (generally, the purchase price) exceeds the  amount payable on maturity (or on an 
earlier call date) constitutes amortizable Bond premium, which must be amortized under Section 171 of 
the Code; such amortizable Bond premium reduces the Bond Owner’s basis in the applicable Bond (and 
the amount of tax-exempt interest received), and is not deductible for federal income tax purposes.  The 
basis reduction as a result of the amortization of Bond premium may result in a Bond Owner realizing a 
taxable  gain  when  a  Bond  is  sold  by  the  Owner  for  an  amount  equal  to  or  less  (under  certain 
circumstances) than the original cost of the Bond to the Owner.  Purchasers of the Bonds should consult 
their own tax advisors as to the treatment, computation and collateral consequences of amortizable Bond 
premium. 

The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) has initiated an expanded program for the auditing of 
tax-exempt bond issues, including both random and targeted audits.  It is possible that the Bonds will be 
selected for audit by the IRS.  It is also possible that the market value of the Bonds might be affected as a 
result of such an audit of the Bonds (or by an audit of similar bonds).  No assurance can be given that in 
the course of an audit, as a result of an audit, or otherwise, Congress or the IRS might not change the 
Code (or interpretation thereof) subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds to the extent that it adversely 
affects the exclusion from gross income of interest on the Bonds or their market value. 

SUBSEQUENT  TO  THE  ISSUANCE  OF  THE  BONDS,  THERE  MIGHT  BE  FEDERAL, 
STATE  OR  LOCAL  STATUTORY  CHANGES 
JUDICIAL  OR  REGULATORY 
INTERPRETATIONS  OF  FEDERAL,  STATE  OR  LOCAL  LAW)  THAT  AFFECT  THE  FEDERAL, 
STATE OR LOCAL TAX TREATMENT OF THE INTEREST ON THE BONDS OR THE MARKET 
VALUE OF THE BONDS.  LEGISLATIVE CHANGES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN CONGRESS, 
WHICH,  IF  ENACTED,  WOULD  RESULT  IN  ADDITIONAL  FEDERAL  INCOME  TAX  BEING 
IMPOSED ON CERTAIN OWNERS OF TAX-EXEMPT STATE OR LOCAL OBLIGATIONS, SUCH 
AS THE BONDS.  THE INTRODUCTION OR ENACTMENT OF ANY SUCH CHANGES COULD 

(OR 

 
 

 64 

 

  NO 
ADVERSELY  AFFECT  THE  MARKET  VALUE  OR  LIQUIDITY  OF  THE  BONDS. 
ASSURANCE  CAN  BE  GIVEN  THAT,  SUBSEQUENT  TO  THE  ISSUANCE  OF  THE  BONDS, 
SUCH  CHANGES  (OR  OTHER  CHANGES)  WILL  NOT  BE  INTRODUCED  OR  ENACTED  OR 
INTERPRETATIONS WILL NOT OCCUR.  BEFORE PURCHASING ANY OF THE BONDS, ALL 
POTENTIAL  PURCHASERS  SHOULD  CONSULT  THEIR  TAX  ADVISORS  REGARDING 
POSSIBLE  STATUTORY  CHANGES  OR  JUDICIAL  OR  REGULATORY  CHANGES  OR 
INTERPRETATIONS,  AND  THEIR  COLLATERAL  TAX  CONSEQUENCES  RELATING  TO  THE 
BONDS. 

Bond Counsel’s opinions may be affected by actions taken (or not taken) or events occurring (or 
not occurring) after the date hereof.  Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine, or to inform any 
person, whether any such actions or events are taken or do occur.  The Resolution and the Tax Certificate 
relating to the Bonds permit certain actions to be taken or to be omitted if a favorable opinion of Bond 
Counsel  is  provided  with  respect  thereto.    Bond  Counsel  expresses  no  opinion  as  to  the  effect  on  the 
exclusion from gross income of interest (and original issue discount) on the Bonds for federal income tax 
purposes with respect to any Bond if any such action is taken or omitted based upon the advice of counsel 
other than Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth.  

Although Bond Counsel has rendered an opinion that interest (and original issue discount) on the 
Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes provided that the District continues 
to comply with certain requirements of the Code, the ownership of the Bonds and the accrual or receipt of 
interest (and original issue discount) with respect to the Bonds may otherwise affect the tax liability of 
certain persons.  Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such tax consequences. Accordingly, 
before purchasing any of the Bonds, all potential purchasers should consult their tax advisors with respect 
to collateral tax consequences relating to the Bonds. 

A  copy  of  the  proposed  form  of  opinion  of  Bond Counsel  for  the  Bonds  is  attached  hereto  as 

APPENDIX A. 

Legality for Investment in California 

LEGAL MATTERS 

Under provisions of the State Financial Code, the Bonds are legal investments for commercial 
banks in the State to the extent that the Bonds, in the informed opinion of the bank, are prudent for the 
investment of funds of depositors, and, under provisions of the State Government Code, are eligible for 
security for deposits of public moneys in the State. 

Information Reporting Requirements 

On May 17, 2006, the President signed the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 
2005 (“TIPRA”).  Under Section 6049 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by TIPRA, 
interest paid on tax-exempt obligations is subject to information reporting in a manner similar to interest 
paid  on  taxable  obligations.    The  effective  date  of  this  provision  is  for  interest  paid  after 
December 31, 2005,  regardless  of  when  the  tax-exempt  obligations  were  issued.    The  purpose  of  this 
change  was  to  assist  in  relevant  information  gathering  for  the  IRS  relating  to  other  applicable  tax 
provisions.  TIPRA provides that backup withholding may apply to such interest payments  made after 
March 31, 2007 to any bondholder who fails to file an accurate Form W-9 or who meets certain other 
criteria.    The  information  reporting  and  backup  withholding  requirements  of  TIPRA  do  not  affect  the 
excludability of such interest from gross income for federal income tax purposes.

Continuing Disclosure 

Current Undertaking.  In connection with the issuance of the Bonds, the District has covenanted 
for the benefit of bondholders (including the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds) to provide certain financial 
information and operating data relating to the District (the “Annual Reports”) by not later than 270 days 
following the end of the District’s fiscal year (which currently ends June 30), commencing with the report 
for the 2015-16 fiscal year, and to provide notices of the occurrence of certain listed events.  The Annual 
Reports and notices of listed events will be filed by the District in accordance with the requirements of the 
Rule.  The specific nature of the information to be contained in the Annual Reports or the notices of listed 
events  is  included  in  “APPENDIX  C  –  FORM  OF  CONTINUING  DISCLOSURE  CERTIFICATE” 
attached hereto.  These covenants have been made in order to assist the Underwriter in complying with 
the Rule. 

Prior Undertakings.  Within the past five years, the District has failed to file in a timely manner 
certain notices of listed events, as required by its prior continuing disclosure undertakings. The District 
has retained Keygent LLC as its dissemination agent to assist it in preparing and filing the annual reports 
and notices of listed events required under its existing continuing disclosure obligations, as well as the 
continuing disclosure undertaking entered into in connection with the Bonds. 

Absence of Material Litigation 

No litigation is pending or threatened concerning the validity of the Bonds, and a certificate to 
that effect will be furnished to purchasers at the time of the original delivery of the Bonds.  The District is 
not  aware  of  any  litigation  pending  or  threatened  questioning  the  political  existence  of  the  District  or 
contesting  the  District’s  ability  to  receive  ad  valorem  property  taxes  or  to  collect  other  revenues  or 
contesting the District’s ability to issue and retire the Bonds. 

Financial Statements 

The  District’s  audited  financial  statements  with  supplemental  information  for  the  year  ended 
June 30, 2015, the independent auditor’s report of the District, the related statements of activities and of 
cash  flows  for  the  year  then  ended,  and  the  report  dated  October  20,  2015  of  Nigro  &  Nigro  PC,  A 
Professional  Accountancy  Corporation  (the  “Auditor”),  are  attached  hereto  as  APPENDIX  B.    In 
connection  with  the  inclusion  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  report  of  the  Auditor  thereon  as 
APPENDIX B to this Official Statement, the District did not request the Auditor to, and the Auditor has 
not  undertaken  to,  update  its  report  or  to  take  any  action  intended  or  likely  to  elicit  information 
concerning the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made in this Official Statement, and 
no opinion is expressed by the Auditor with respect to any event subsequent to the date of its report. 

Legal Opinion 

The legal opinion of Bond Counsel, approving the validity of the Bonds, will be supplied to the 
original  purchasers  of  the  Bonds  without  cost.    A  copy  of  the  proposed  form  of  such  legal  opinion  is 
attached to this Official Statement as APPENDIX A.  

 
 

 66 

 

Escrow Verification 

Upon  delivery  of  the  Bonds,  the  Verification  Agent  will  deliver  a  report  on  the  mathematical 
accuracy of certain computations based upon certain information and assertions provided to them by the 
Underwriter relating to (a) the adequacy of the maturing principal of and interest on the Federal Securities 
in the Escrow Fund, together with any moneys held therein as cash, to pay the redemption price of and 
interest on the Refunded Bonds, and (b) the computations of yield of the Bonds and the Federal Securities 
in  the  Escrow  Fund  which  support  Bond  Counsel’s  opinion  that  the  interest  on  the  Bonds  is  excluded 
from gross income for federal income tax purposes.   

Rating 

MISCELLANEOUS 

The Bonds have been assigned a rating of “AA-” by S&P.  The rating reflects only the views of 
the  rating  agency,  and  any  explanation  of  the  significance  of  such  rating  should  be  obtained  from  the 
rating agency at the following address:  Standard & Poor’s, a Division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, 
55  Water  Street,  45th  Floor,  New  York,  NY  10041.    Generally,  rating  agencies  base  their  ratings  on 
information  and  materials  furnished  to  them  (which  may  include  information  and  material  from  the 
District which is not included in this Official Statement) and on investigations, studies and assumptions 
by the rating agencies.  There is no assurance that the rating will be retained for any given period of time 
or  that  the  same  will  not  be  revised  downward  or  withdrawn  entirely  by  the  rating  agency  if,  in  the 
judgment  of  the  rating  agency,  circumstances  so  warrant.    The  District  undertakes  no  responsibility  to 
oppose  any  such  revision  or  withdrawal.    Any  such  downward  revision  or  withdrawal  of  the  rating 
obtained may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds. 

The  District  has  covenanted  in  a  Continuing  Disclosure  Certificate  to  file  on  the  Electronic 
Municipal Market Access (“EMMA”) website operated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board 
notices of any rating changes on the Bonds.  See “LEGAL MATTERS - Continuing Disclosure” herein 
and  “APPENDIX  C  -  FORM  OF  CONTINUING  DISCLOSURE  CERTIFICATE”  attached  hereto.  
Notwithstanding  such  covenant,  information  relating  to  rating  changes  on  the  Bonds  may  be  publicly 
available from the rating agency prior to such information being provided to the District and prior to the 
date the District is obligated to file a notice of rating change on EMMA.  Purchasers of the Bonds are 
directed to the rating agency and its website and official media outlets for the most current rating changes 
with respect to the Bonds after the initial issuance of the Bonds. 

Underwriting 

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (the “Underwriter”) has agreed, pursuant to a purchase 
contract by and between the District  and the Underwriter, to purchase  all of the Bonds for a purchase 
price of $19,825,598.00, which is equal to the initial principal amount of the Bonds of $19,315,000.00, 
plus net original issue premium of $573,371.75, and less an underwriting discount of $62,773.75.  

The purchase contract for the Bonds provides that the Underwriter will purchase all of the Bonds 
if any are purchased, the obligation to make such purchase being subject to certain terms and conditions 
set  forth  in  such  purchase  contract,  the  approval  of certain  legal  matters  by  Bond  Counsel and  certain 
other conditions.  The initial offering prices stated on the cover of this Official Statement may be changed 
from time to time by the Underwriter.  The Underwriter may offer and sell Bonds to certain dealers and 
others at prices lower than such initial offering prices.

APPENDIX A 

FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL 

Upon the issuance and delivery of the Bonds, Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth, Bond Counsel, 
proposes to render its final approving opinion with respect to the Bonds substantially in the following 
form: 

March 1, 2016 

Board of Education 
Bonita Unified School District 

Members of the Board of Education: 

We have examined a certified copy of the record of the proceedings relative to the issuance and 
sale  of  $19,315,000  Bonita  Unified  School  District  (Los  Angeles  County,  California)  2016  General 
Obligation  Refunding  Bonds  (the  “Bonds”).    As  to  questions  of  fact  material  to  our  opinion,  we  have 
relied upon the certified proceedings and other certifications of public officials furnished to us without 
undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation. 

Based  on  our  examination  as  bond  counsel  of  existing  law,  certified  copies  of  such  legal 
proceedings and such other proofs as we deem necessary to render this opinion, we are of the opinion, as 
of the date hereof and under existing law, that: 

1. 

Such proceedings and proofs show lawful authority for the issuance and sale of 
the Bonds pursuant to Articles 9 and 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the 
California  Government  Code,  and  a  resolution  (the  “Resolution”)  adopted  by  the  Board  of 
Education of the Bonita Unified School District (the “District”) on May 6, 2015. 

2.   

The  Bonds  constitute  valid  and  binding  general  obligations  of  the  District, 
payable as to both principal and interest from the proceeds of a levy of ad valorem taxes on all 
property subject to such taxes in the District, which taxes are unlimited as to rate or amount. 

3.   

Under existing statutes, regulations, rulings and judicial decisions, interest on the 
Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is not an item of tax 
preference  for  purposes  of  calculating  the  federal  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on 
individuals and corporations; however, it should be noted that, with respect to corporations, such 
interest on the Bonds may be included as an adjustment in the calculation of alternative minimum 
taxable income, which may affect the alternative minimum tax liability of such corporations. 

4.   

Interest on the Bonds is exempt from State of California personal income tax. 

5.   

The  difference  between  the  issue  price  of  a  Bond  (the  first  price  at  which  a 
substantial  amount  of  the  Bonds  of  a  maturity  is  to  be  sold  to  the  public)  and  the  stated 
redemption  price  at  maturity  with  respect  to  such  Bonds  constitutes  original  issue  discount.  
Original issue discount accrues under a constant yield method, and original issue discount will 
accrue  to  a  Bondowner  before  receipt  of  cash  attributable  to  such  excludable  income.    The 
amount  of  original  issue  discount  deemed  received  by  a  Bondowner  will  increase  the 
Bondowner’s  basis  in  the  applicable  Bond.    Original  issue  discount  that  accrues  to  the 
Bondowner is excluded from the gross income of such owner for federal income tax purposes, is 

 
 

A-1 

 

not  an  item  of  tax  preference  for  purposes  of  the  federal  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on 
individuals and corporations, and is exempt from State of California personal income tax. 

6.   

The amount by which a Bondowner’s original basis for determining loss on sale 
or exchange in the applicable Bond (generally, the purchase price) exceeds the amount payable 
on  maturity  (or  on  an  earlier  call  date)  constitutes  amortizable  Bond  premium,  which  must  be 
amortized under Section 171 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”); 
such amortizable Bond premium reduces the Bondowner’s basis in the applicable Bond (and the 
amount of tax-exempt interest received), and is not deductible for federal income tax purposes.  
The basis reduction as a result of the amortization of Bond premium may result in a Bondowner 
realizing a taxable gain when a Bond is sold by the Bondowner for an amount equal to or less 
(under certain circumstances) than the original cost of the Bond to the Bondowner.  Purchasers of 
the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors as to the treatment, computation and collateral 
consequences of amortizable Bond premium. 

The opinions expressed herein may be affected by actions taken (or not taken) or events occurring 
(or not occurring) after the date hereof.  We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, 
whether any such actions or events are taken or do occur.  The Resolution and the Tax Certificate relating 
to the Bonds permit certain actions to be taken or to be omitted if a favorable opinion of Bond Counsel is 
provided with respect thereto.  No opinion is expressed herein as to the effect on the exclusion from gross 
income of interest (and original issue discount) for federal income tax purposes with respect to any Bond 
if any such action is taken or omitted based upon the advice of counsel other than ourselves.  Other than 
expressly stated herein, we express no opinion regarding tax consequences with respect to the Bonds. 

The  opinions  expressed  herein  as  to  the  exclusion  from  gross  income  of  interest  (and  original 
issue discount) on the Bonds are based upon certain representations of fact and certifications made by the 
District and others and are subject to the condition that the District complies with all requirements of the 
Code,  that  must  be  satisfied  subsequent  to  the  issuance  of  the  Bonds  to  assure  that  such  interest  (and 
original  issue  discount)  will  not  become  includable  in  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  
Failure to comply with such requirements of the Code might cause interest (and original issue discount) 
on the Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of 
issuance of the Bonds.  The District has covenanted to comply with all such requirements. 

It is possible that subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds there might be federal, state, or local 
statutory changes (or judicial or regulatory interpretations of federal, state, or local law) that affect the 
federal, state, or local tax treatment of the Bonds or the market value of the Bonds.  No assurance can be 
given that subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds such changes or interpretations will not occur. 

The  rights  of  the  owners  of  the  Bonds  and  the  enforceability  thereof  may  be  subject  to 
bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  and  other  similar  laws  affecting  creditors’  rights 
heretofore or hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable and their enforcement may also be 
subject to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases, and by the limitations on legal remedies 
against public agencies in the State of California. 

Respectfully submitted, 
 
Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth

Auditors'	Responsibility	

INDEPENDENT	AUDITORS’	REPORT	

Management’s	Responsibility	for	the	Financial	Statements	

		Board	of	Education	
Bonita	Unified	School	District	
San	Dimas,	California	
		
We	have	audited	the	accompanying	financial	statements	of	the	governmental	activities,	each	major	fund,	and	
the	aggregate	remaining	fund	information	of	Bonita	Unified	School	District,	as	of	and	for	the	fiscal	year	ended	
June	30,	2015,	and	the	related	notes	to	the	financial	statements,	which	collectively	comprise	the	District's	
basic	financial	statements	as	listed	in	the	table	of	contents.	
	
Management	is	responsible	for	the	preparation	and	fair	presentation	of	these	financial	statements	in	
accordance	with	accounting	principles	generally	accepted	in	the	United	States	of	America;	this	includes	the	
design,	implementation,	and	maintenance	of	internal	control	relevant	to	the	preparation	and	fair	presentation	
of	financial	statements	that	are	free	from	material	misstatement,	whether	due	to	fraud	or	error.	
	
Our	responsibility	is	to	express	opinions	on	these	financial	statements	based	on	our	audit.	We	conducted	our	
audit	in	accordance	with	auditing	standards	generally	accepted	in	the	United	States	of	America,	the	standards	
applicable	to	financial	audits	contained	in	Government	Auditing	Standards,	issued	by	the	Comptroller	General	
of	the	United	States,	and	the	 2014‐15	 Guide	 for	 Annual	 Audits	 of	 K‐12	 Local	 Education	 Agencies	 and	 State	
Compliance	 Reporting.	 	Those	standards	require	that	we	plan	and	perform	the	audit	to	obtain	reasonable	
assurance	about	whether	the	financial	statements	are	free	from	material	misstatement.	
	An	audit	involves	performing	procedures	to	obtain	audit	evidence	about	the	amounts	and	disclosures	in	the	
financial	statements.	The	procedures	selected	depend	on	the	auditor’s	judgment,	including	the	assessment	of	
the	risks	of	material	misstatement	of	the	financial	statements,	whether	due	to	fraud	or	error.	In	making	those	
risk	assessments,	the	auditor	considers	internal	control	relevant	to	the	entity’s	preparation	and	fair	
presentation	of	the	financial	statements	in	order	to	design	audit	procedures	that	are	appropriate	in	the	
circumstances,	but	not	for	the	purpose	of	expressing	an	opinion	on	the	effectiveness	of	the	entity’s	internal	
control.	Accordingly,	we	express	no	such	opinion.	An	audit	also	includes	evaluating	the	appropriateness	of	
accounting	policies	used	and	the	reasonableness	of	significant	accounting	estimates	made	by	management,	as	
well	as	evaluating	the	overall	presentation	of	the	financial	statements.	
	We	believe	that	the	audit	evidence	we	have	obtained	is	sufficient	and	appropriate	to	provide	a	basis	for	our	
audit	opinions.	
	
In	our	opinion,	the	financial	statements	referred	to	above	present	fairly,	in	all	material	respects,	the	respective	
financial	position	of	the	governmental	activities,	each	major	fund,	and	the	aggregate	remaining	fund	
information	of	Bonita	Unified	School	District,	as	of	June	30,	2015,	and	the	respective	changes	in	financial	
position	thereof	for	the	fiscal	year	then	ended	in	accordance	with	accounting	principles	generally	accepted	in	
the	United	States	of	America.

Other	Information	

	
Other	Matters	
Required	Supplementary	Information	

As	discussed	in	Note	1.I.	to	the	basic	financial	statements,	the	District	has	changed	its	method	for	accounting	
and	reporting	for	pensions	during	fiscal	year	2014‐15	due	to	the	adoption	of	Governmental	Accounting	
Standards	Board	Statement	No.	68,	"Accounting	and	Financial	Reporting	for	Pensions‐An	Amendment	of	GASB	
Statement	No.	27"	and	No.	71,	"Pension	Transition	for	Contributions	Made	Subsequent	to	the	Measurement	Date‐
An	Amendment	of	GASB	Statement	No.	68".		The	adoption	of	these	standards	required	retrospective	application	
resulting	in	a	$76,381,453	reduction	of	previously	reported	net	position	at	July	1,	2014.		Our	opinion	is	not	
modified	with	respect	to	this	matter.	
Accounting	principles	generally	accepted	in	the	United	States	of	America	require	that	the	management’s	
discussion	and	analysis	on	pages	3	through	10,	budgetary	comparison	information	on	page	47,	schedule	of	
funding	progress	on	page	48,	schedule	of	proportionate	share	of	the	net	pension	liability	on	page	49,	and	
schedule	of	contributions	on	page	50	be	presented	to	supplement	the	basic	financial	statements.		Such	
information,	although	not	a	part	of	the	basic	financial	statements,	is	required	by	the	Governmental	Accounting	
Standards	Board,	who	considers	it	to	be	an	essential	part	of	financial	reporting	for	placing	the	basic	financial	
statements	in	an	appropriate	operational,	economic,	or	historical	context.		We	have	applied	certain	limited	
procedures	to	the	required	supplementary	information	in	accordance	with	auditing	standards	generally	
accepted	in	the	United	States	of	America,	which	consisted	of	inquiries	of	management	about	the	methods	of	
preparing	the	information	and	comparing	the	information	for	consistency	with	management’s	responses	to	
our	inquiries,	the	basic	financial	statements,	and	other	knowledge	we	obtained	during	our	audit	of	the	basic	
financial	statements.	We	do	not	express	an	opinion	or	provide	any	assurance	on	the	information	because	the	
limited	procedures	do	not	provide	us	with	sufficient	evidence	to	express	an	opinion	or	provide	any	assurance.	
	
Our	audit	was	conducted	for	the	purpose	of	forming	opinions	on	the	financial	statements	that	collectively	
comprise	the	District’s	basic	financial	statements.	The	supplementary	information	is	presented	for	purposes	of	
additional	analysis	and	is	not	a	required	part	of	the	basic	financial	statements.	The	schedule	of	expenditures	of	
federal	awards	is	presented	for	purposes	of	additional	analysis	as	required	by	U.S.	Office	of	Management	and	
Budget	Circular	A‐133,	 Audits	 of	 States,	 Local	 Governments,	 and	 Non‐Profit	 Organizations,	and	is	also	not	a	
required	part	of	the	basic	financial	statements.	The	supplementary	information	on	pages	53	to	56	and	the	
schedule	of	expenditures	of	federal	awards	on	page	57	are	the	responsibility	of	management	and	were	
derived	from	and	relate	directly	to	the	underlying	accounting	and	other	records	used	to	prepare	the	basic	
financial	statements.	Such	information	has	been	subjected	to	the	auditing	procedures	applied	in	the	audit	of	
the	basic	financial	statements	and	certain	additional	procedures,	including	comparing	and	reconciling	such	
information	directly	to	the	underlying	accounting	and	other	records	used	to	prepare	the	basic	financial	
statements	or	to	the	basic	financial	statements	themselves,	and	other	additional	procedures	in	accordance	
with	auditing	standards	generally	accepted	in	the	United	States	of	America.	In	our	opinion,	the	information	is	
fairly	stated	in	all	material	respects	in	relation	to	the	basic	financial	statements	as	a	whole.	The	information	on	
page	52	has	not	been	subjected	to	the	auditing	procedures	applied	in	the	audit	of	the	basic	financial	
statements	and	accordingly,	we	do	not	express	an	opinion	or	provide	any	assurance	on	it.			
	
In	accordance	with	Government	Auditing	Standards,	we	have	also	issued	our	report	dated	October	20,	2015	on	
our	consideration	of	the	District's	internal	control	over	financial	reporting	and	on	our	tests	of	its	compliance	
with	certain	provisions	of	laws,	regulations,	contracts,	and	grant	agreements	and	other	matters.		The	purpose	
of	that	report	is	to	describe	the	scope	of	our	testing	of	internal	control	over	financial	reporting	and	
compliance	and	the	results	of	that	testing,	and	not	to	provide	an	opinion	on	internal	control	over	financial	
reporting	or	on	compliance.		That	report	is	an	integral	part	of	an	audit	performed	in	accordance	with	
Government	 Auditing	 Standards	in	considering	the	District's	internal	control	over	financial	reporting	and	
compliance.

OVERVIEW	OF	THE	FINANCIAL	STATEMENTS	

BONITA	UNIFIED	SCHOOL	DISTRICT	
Management’s	Discussion	and	Analysis	(Unaudited)	
For	the	Fiscal	Year	Ended	June	30,	2015	

		This	discussion	and	analysis	of	Bonita	Unified	School	District’s	financial	performance	provides	an	overview	of	
the	District’s	financial	activities	for	the	fiscal	year	ended	June	30,	2015.		Please	read	it	in	conjunction	with	the	
District’s	financial	statements,	which	immediately	follow	this	section.	
		
	
  The	District’s	financial	status	decreased	overall	as	a	result	of	this	year’s	operations.		Net	position	of	
governmental	activities	decreased	by	$1.3	million,	or	9.5%.	
  Governmental	expenses	were	approximately	$107.3	million.		Revenues	were	approximately	$106.0	
million.	
  The	District	spent	more	than	$5.8	million	on	new	capital	assets	during	the	year,	much	of	which	was	for	
the	San	Dimas	High	School	gymnasium.	
  The	District	decreased	its	outstanding	long‐term	debt	by	$16.2	million,	primarily	due	to	the	reduction	of	
the	net	pension	liability	during	the	year.	
  Grades	K‐12	average	daily	attendance	(ADA)	increased	by	154,	or	1.6%.	
		
	This	annual	report	consists	of	three	parts	–	management	discussion	and	analysis	(this	section),	the	basic	
financial	statements,	and	required	supplementary	information.		The	basic	financial	statements	include	two	
kinds	of	statements	that	present	different	views	of	the	District:	
	
The	first	two	statements	are	 district‐wide	 financial	 statements	that	provide	both	short‐term	and	long‐
term	information	about	the	District’s	overall	financial	status.	
The	remaining	statements	are	 fund	 financial	 statements	that	focus	on	individual	parts	of	the	District,	
reporting	the	District’s	operations	in	more	detail	than	the	district‐wide	statements.	
  The	governmental	funds	statements	tell	how	basic	services	like	regular	and	special	education	were	
financed	in	the	short	term	as	well	as	what	remains	for	future	spending.	
Fiduciary	 funds	statement	provides	information	about	the	financial	relationships	in	which	the	
District	acts	solely	as	a	trustee	or	agent	for	the	benefit	of	others	to	whom	the	resources	belong.	
				The	financial	statements	also

OVERVIEW	OF	THE	FINANCIAL	STATEMENTS	(continued)	
	
District‐Wide	Statements	

BONITA	UNIFIED	SCHOOL	DISTRICT	
Management’s	Discussion	and	Analysis	(Unaudited)	
For	the	Fiscal	Year	Ended	June	30,	2015	

		
The	district‐wide	statements	report	information	about	the	District	as	a	whole	using	accounting	methods	
similar	to	those	used	by	private‐sector	companies.		The	statement	of	net	position	includes	all	of	the	District’s	
assets	and	liabilities.		All	of	the	current	year’s	revenues	and	expenses	are	accounted	for	in	the	statement	of	
activities	regardless	of	when	cash	is	received	or	paid.	
	The	two	district‐wide	statements	report	the	District’s	net	position	and	how	it	has	changed.		Net	position	–	the	
difference	between	the	District’s	assets	and	deferred	outflows	of	resources	and	liabilities	and	deferred	inflows	
of	resources	–	is	one	way	to	measure	the	District’s	financial	health,	or	position.	
	
  Over	time,	increases	and	decreases	in	the	District’s	net	position	are	an	indicator	of	whether	its	financial	
position	is	improving	or	deteriorating,	respectively.	
	
  To	assess	the	overall	health	of	the	District,	you	need	to	consider	additional	nonfinancial	factors	such	as	
changes	in	the	District’s	demographics	and	the	condition	of	school	buildings	and	other	facilities.	
	
In	the	district‐wide	financial	statements,	the	District’s	activities	are	categorized	as	 Governmental	
Activities.		Most	of	the	District’s	basic	services	are	included	here,	such	as	regular	and	special	education,	
transportation,	and	administration.		Property	taxes	and	state	aid	finance	most	of	these	activities.	
	
The	fund	financial	statements	provide	more	detailed	information	about	the	District’s	most	significant	funds	–	
not	the	District	as	a	whole.		Funds	are	accounting	devices	the	District	uses	to	keep	track	of	specific	sources	of	
funding	and	spending	on	particular	programs:	
	
Some	funds	are	required	by	State	law	and	by	bond	covenants.	
	
The	District	establishes	other	funds	to	control	and	manage	money	for	particular	purposes	(like	repaying	
its	long‐term	debt)	or	to	show	that	it	is	properly	using	certain	revenues.	
	The	District	has	two	kinds	of	funds:	
	
Governmental	 funds	–	Most	of	the	District’s	basic	services	are	included	in	governmental	funds,	which	
generally	focus	on	(1)	how	cash	and	other	financial	assets	that	can	readily	be	converted	to	cash	flow	in	
and	out	and	(2)	the	balances	left	at	year‐end	that	are	available	for	spending.		Consequently,	the	
governmental	funds	statements	provide	a	detailed	short‐term	view	that	helps	you	determine	whether	
there	are	more	or	fewer	financial	resources	that	can	be	spent	in	the	near	future	to	finance	the	District’s	
programs.		Because	this	information	does	not	encompass	the	additional	long‐term	focus	of	the	district‐
wide	statements,	we	provide	additional	information	on	a	separate	reconciliation	page	that	explains	the	
relationship	(or	differences)	between	them.	
Fiduciary	 funds	–	The	District	is	the	trustee,	or	fiduciary,	for	assets	that	belong	to	others,	such	as	the	
student	activities	funds.		The	District	is	responsible	for	ensuring	that	the	assets	reported	in	these	funds	
are	used	only	for	their	intended	purposes	and	by	those	to	whom	the	assets	belong.		All	of	the	District’s	
fiduciary	activities	are	reported	in	a	separate	statement	of	fiduciary	net	position.		We	exclude	these	
activities	from	the	district‐wide	financial	statements	because	the	District	cannot	use	these	assets	to	
finance	its	operations.

Changes	in	net	position,	governmental	activities.		The	District’s	total	revenues	increased	12.0%	to	$106.0	
million	(See	Table	A‐2).		The	increase	is	due	primarily	to	federal	and	state	aid.	
	The	total	cost	of	all	programs	and	services	increased	12.0%	to	$107.3	million.		The	District’s	expenses	are	
predominantly	related	to	educating	and	caring	for	students,	75.5%.		The	purely	administrative	activities	of	the	
District	accounted	for	just	5.9%	of	total	costs.		A	significant	contributor	to	the	increase	in	costs	was	due	to	
increase	in	compensation	to	district	personnel.

FINANCIAL	ANALYSIS	OF	THE	DISTRICT’S	FUNDS	

BONITA	UNIFIED	SCHOOL	DISTRICT	
Management’s	Discussion	and	Analysis	(Unaudited)	
For	the	Fiscal	Year	Ended	June	30,	2015	

		
	The	financial	performance	of	the	District	as	a	whole	is	reflected	in	its	governmental	funds	as	well.		As	the	
District	completed	this	year,	its	governmental	funds	reported	a	combined	fund	balance	of	$61.5	million,	which	
is	below	last	year’s	ending	fund	balance	of	$64.9	million.		The	primary	cause	of	the	decreased	fund	balance	is	
increased	spending	in	the	General	Fund.	
	
Over	the	course	of	the	year,	the	District	revised	the	annual	operating	budget	several	times.		The	major	budget	
amendments	fall	into	these	categories:	
	
  Revenues	–	increased	by	$4.2	million	primarily	to	reflect	changes	in	federal	and	state	funding.	
Salaries	and	benefits	costs	–	increased	$1.4	million	due	to	negotiated	increases	with	district	
personnel.	
  Books	and	supplies	–	increased	$1.7	million	to	re‐budget	carryover	funds	from	the	previous	year.	
	While	the	District’s	final	budget	for	the	General	Fund	anticipated	that	expenditures	would	exceed	revenues	by	
about	$7.9	million,	the	actual	results	for	the	year	show	that	revenues	fell	short	of	expenditures	by	roughly	
$2.5	million.		Actual	revenues	were	$0.1	million	less	than	anticipated,	and	expenditures	were	$5.6	million	less	
than	budgeted.		That	amount	consists	primarily	of	restricted	categorical	program	dollars	that	were	not	spent	
as	of	June	30,	2015,	that	will	be	carried	over	into	the	2015‐16	budget.	
		
CAPITAL	ASSET	AND	DEBT	ADMINISTRATION	
	
Capital	Assets	
By	the	end	of	2014‐15	the	District	had	invested	$5.8	million	in	new	capital	assets,	related	to	the	construction	
of	the	San	Dimas	High	School	gymnasium.		(More	detailed	information	about	capital	assets	can	be	found	in	
Note	5	to	the	financial	statements).		Total	depreciation	expense	for	the	year	exceeded	$6.5	million.

Overview	

FACTORS	BEARING	ON	THE	DISTRICT’S	FUTURE	

	
	On	June	16,	2015,	the	Governor,	the	Senate	President	pro	Tempore,	and	the	Speaker	of	the	Assembly	
announced	a	budget	agreement.		The	Legislature	passed	the	budget	bill	and	related	legislation	on	Friday,	June	
19.		The	budget	agreement	relies	on	the	administration’s	May	2015	estimates	of	(1)	General	Fund	revenues,	
(2)	the	Proposition	98	minimum	guarantee	for	schools	and	community	colleges,	and	(3)	budget	reserve	and	
debt	payment	requirements	under	Proposition	2.		School	and	community	college	funding	is	the	centerpiece	of	
the	agreement,	as	administration	estimates	of	the	Proposition	98	minimum	guarantee	have	increased	
substantially	over	June	2014	levels.		With	savings	resulting	from	(1)	rejection	of	various	administration	
proposals,	(2)	an	error	in	the	administration’s	Medi‐Cal	estimates,	(3)	legislative	changes	made	to	the	Middle‐
Class	Scholarship	Program,	and	(4)	other	legislative	actions,	the	agreement	makes	modest	augmentations	
outside	of	Proposition	98	above	May	Revision	levels.	
	
The	budget	agreement	assumes	$115	billion	in	revenues,	a	3.3	percent	increase	over	2014‐15.		(This	total	is	
net	of	the	$1.9	billion	deposit	in	the	Proposition	2	Budget	Stabilization	Account	[BSA].)		The	state’s	“big	three”	
General	Fund	taxes—the	personal	income	tax,	sales	and	use	tax,	and	corporation	tax—are	estimated	to	
increase	at	a	slightly	higher	rate	(4	percent).		General	Fund	revenue	growth	was	much	higher	in	2014‐15,	
increasing	at	a	very	healthy	7.7	percent	rate.		General	Fund	spending	is	largely	flat	across	2014‐15	and	
2015‐16,	increasing	at	only	0.8	percent.		Growth	in	ongoing	programmatic	spending,	however,	is	masked	by	
various	one‐time	actions,	including	one‐time	spending	in	2014‐15	on	debt	payments	and	mandate	backlog	
claims,	and	the	end	of	the	“triple	flip”	mechanism	used	to	finance	the	state’s	prior	deficit	financing	bonds.		The	
budget	ends	2015‐16	with	$4.6	billion	in	estimated	total	reserves,	including	$1.1	billion	in	the	Special	Fund	
for	Economic	Uncertainties—the	state’s	traditional	budget	reserve—and	$3.5	billion	in	the	BSA.

BONITA	UNIFIED	SCHOOL	DISTRICT	
Management’s	Discussion	and	Analysis	(Unaudited)	
For	the	Fiscal	Year	Ended	June	30,	2015	

		
	
	
State	budgeting	for	preschool,	elementary	and	secondary	schools,	and	the	California	Community	Colleges	
(CCC)	is	based	primarily	on	Proposition	98,	approved	by	voters	in	1988.		Proposition	98	established	a	
minimum	funding	requirement	commonly	called	the	minimum	guarantee.		The	estimate	of	the	2013‐14	and	
2014‐15	minimum	guarantees	have	increased	$612	million	and	$5.4	billion,	respectively	from	the	June	2014	
estimates.		The	estimate	of	the	2015‐16	minimum	guarantee	is	$7.6	billion	(12	percent)	higher	than	the	2014‐
15	Budget	Act	level.		These	increases	in	the	guarantee	are	due	primarily	to	state	revenues	being	higher	than	
assumed	in	last	year’s	budget	package.		The	budget	package	funds	at	these	latest	estimates	of	the	minimum	
guarantees.	
	
Growth	from	the	revised	2014‐15	level	to	2015‐16	is	$2.1	billion	(3	percent).		This	relatively	modest	growth	
is	due	to	the	large	upward	revision	to	2014‐15	noted	above.		In	2015‐16,	total	Proposition	98	funding	is	$68.4	
billion.		Of	this	amount,	$49.4	billion	is	General	Fund	and	$19	billion	is	local	property	tax	revenue.		The	
notable	increase	in	local	property	tax	revenue	from	2014‐15	to	2015‐16	($2.3	billion,	14	percent)	is	due	in	
large	part	to	the	end	of	the	triple	flip	and	the	shift	of	associated	local	property	tax	revenue	back	from	cities,	
counties,	and	special	districts	to	school	and	community	college	districts.		Growth	in	local	property	tax	revenue	
is	slightly	greater	than	growth	in	the	Proposition	98	minimum	guarantee,	resulting	in	a	slight	reduction	in	
Proposition	98	General	Fund	from	2014‐15	to	2015‐16.	
	
Under	the	budget	package,	K‐12	per‐student	funding	increases	from	the	2014‐15	Budget	Act	level	of	$8,931	to	
$9,942	in	2015‐16—an	increase	of	$1,011	(11	percent).			
	
For	2013‐14,	the	budget	accounts	for	higher	Local	Control	Funding	Formula	(LCFF)	costs	and	uses	the	
remaining	funding	increase	for	paying	down	the	K‐14	mandate	backlog.		In	addition	to	these	changes,	the	
budget	package	includes	a	$256	million	settle‐up	payment	related	to	meeting	the	Proposition	98	minimum	
guarantee	for	2006‐07	and	2009‐10	and	$207	million	in	unspent	prior‐year	Proposition	98	funds	that	have	
been	repurposed.		
	
The	budget	package	includes	the	following	K‐14	actions,	all	of	which	reduce	the	state’s	outstanding	K‐14	
obligations.	
	
  Pays	 Down	 Mandate	 Backlog.	 	The	budget	package	includes	$3.8	billion	to	pay	down	the	K‐14	
mandate	backlog	($3.2	billion	is	for	the	K‐12	backlog	and	$632	million	for	the	CCC	backlog).		After	
accounting	for	these	payments,	the	LAO	estimates	the	outstanding	K‐14	mandate	backlog	to	be	$1.5	
billion	($1.2	billion	for	schools	and	about	$300	million	for	community	colleges).	
  Retires	All	K‐14	Payment	Deferrals.		As	required	by	trailer	legislation	enacted	last	year,	the	budget	
package	provides	$992	million	to	eliminate	all	remaining	K‐14	payment	deferrals.		The	budget	year	
will	be	the	first	fiscal	year	since	2000‐01	that	the	state	is	set	to	make	all	K‐14	payments	on	time.	
  Pays	Off	Emergency	Repair	Program	(ERP)	Obligation.		The	budget	includes	$273	million	for	the	
final	ERP	payment.		Statute	requires	the	state	to	provide	a	total	of	$800	million	to	school	districts	for	
emergency	facility	repairs,	and	the	state	has	provided	$527	million	to	date.		(Of	the	$273	million,	
$145	million	comes	from	a	settle‐up	payment	and	$128	million	comes	from	unspent	prior‐year	
Proposition	98	funds.)

The	largest	single	augmentation	in	the	state	budget	is	$6.0	billion	for	implementing	the	LCFF	for	school	
districts	and	charter	schools—bringing	total	LCFF	funding	to	$52	billion.		This	reflects	a	13	percent	year‐over‐
year	increase	in	LCFF	funding.		The	administration	estimates	this	funding	will	close	52	percent	of	the	
remaining	gap	to	LCFF	target	rates.		The	budget	funds	90	percent	of	the	estimated	statewide	full	LCFF	
implementation	cost.		School	districts	and	charter	schools	may	use	LCFF	monies	for	any	educational	purpose,	
including	implementation	of	their	Local	Control	and	Accountability	Plans.	
The	budget	package	includes	$900	million	in	one‐time	funding	for	a	three‐year	competitive	grant	program	to	
promote	high‐quality	CTE.	Of	this	amount,	$400	million	is	provided	in	2015‐16,	$300	million	in	2016‐17,	and	
$200	million	in	2017‐18.		School	districts,	county	offices	of	education	(COEs),	charter	schools,	and	Regional	
Occupational	Centers	and	Programs	operated	by	joint	powers	agencies	(JPAs)	may	apply	for	grants,	
individually	or	in	consortia.		The	program	provides	separate	pools	of	funding	for	large,	medium‐sized,	and	
small	applicants,	based	on	applicants’	average	daily	attendance	(ADA)	in	grades	7‐12.		Specifically,	88	percent	
of	the	funding	is	reserved	for	applicants	with	ADA	greater	than	550,	8	percent	is	reserved	for	applicants	with	
ADA	between	140	and	550,	and	4	percent	is	reserved	for	applicants	with	less	than	140	ADA.		The	
Superintendent	of	Public	Instruction	(SPI),	in	collaboration	with	the	executive	director	of	the	State	Board	of	
Education	(SBE),	will	determine	the	number	of	grants	to	be	awarded	and	specific	grant	amounts.	
	
The	budget	includes	$67	million	for	a	package	of	special	education‐related	activities.		Of	the	$67	million,	$52	
million	is	ongoing	and	$15	million	is	one	time.		The	largest	ongoing	augmentation	in	this	package	is	for	
expanding	services	for	infants,	toddlers,	and	preschoolers	with	disabilities	as	well	as	requiring	preschool	staff	
training	and	parent	education	relating	to	identifying	and	meeting	preschoolers’	special	needs.		The	largest	
one‐time	augmentation	is	for	one	or	two	COEs	to	develop	statewide	resources	and	training	opportunities	for	
addressing	students’	diverse	instructional	and	behavioral	needs.	
The	budget	includes	$50	million	in	one‐time	funding	for	the	second	round	of	Broadband	Internet	
Infrastructure	Grants.		The	K‐12	High	Speed	Network	is	to	award	grants	to	schools	that	cannot	administer	
online	tests	or	can	only	administer	the	tests	by	shutting	down	other	essential	online	activities	such	as	email.	
Grants	may	be	used	to	purchase	Internet	infrastructure.		The	Department	of	Finance	(DOF)	must	approve	
projects	resulting	in	costs	exceeding	$1,000	per	test‐taking	pupil.	
		All	of	these	factors	were	considered	in	preparing	the	Bonita	Unified	School	District	budget	for	the	2015‐16	
fiscal	year.	
		
	This	financial	report	is	designed	to	provide	our	citizens,	taxpayers,	customers,	and	investors	and	creditors	
with	a	general	overview	of	the	District’s	finances	and	to	demonstrate	the	District’s	accountability	for	the	
money	it	receives.		If	you	have	any	questions	about	this	report	or	need	additional	financial	information,

Total	fund	balances	‐	governmental	funds

Capital	assets	used	in	governmental	activities	are	not	financial	resources	and	therefore	are	not
reported	as	assets	in	governmental	funds.		The	cost	of	the	assets	is	$209,738,479	and	the
accumulated	depreciation	is	$64,912,079.																							
In	governmental	funds,	interest	subsidies	received	from	Build	America	Bonds	(BABs)	and
Qualified	School	Construction	Bonds	(QSCBs)	are	recognized	in	the	period	that	they	are	
received.	In	the	government‐wide	statements,	they	are	recognized	in	the	period	that	they

government‐wide	statements	were:
Deferred	amounts	on	refunding	represent	amounts	paid	to	an	escrow	agent	in	excess	of	the	
outstanding	debt	at	the	time	of	the	payment	for	refunded	bonds	which	have	been	defeased.
In	the	government‐wide	statements	it	is	recognized	as	deferred	outflow	of	resources.		The	
remaining	deferred	amounts	on	refunding	at	the	end	of	the	period	were:

the	period	was:
Long‐term	liabilities,	including	bonds	payable,	are	not	due	and	payable	in	the	current	period

BONITA	UNIFIED	SCHOOL	DISTRICT	
Reconciliation	of	the	Governmental	Funds	Statement	of	Revenues,	Expenditures,	
	
For	the	Fiscal	Year	Ended	June	30,	2015	

and	Changes	in	Fund	Balances	to	the	Statement	of	Activities	

		

Total	net	change	in	fund	balances	‐	governmental	funds

Amounts	reported	for	governmental	activities	in	the	statement	of	activities	are	different	because:
In	governmental	funds,	the	costs	of	capital	assets	are	reported	as	expenditures	in	the	period	when	the
assets	are	acquired.		In	the	statement	of	activities,	costs	of	capital	assets	are	allocated	over	their	
estimated	useful	lives	as	depreciation	expense.		The	difference	between	capital	outlay	expenditures	
and	depreciation	expense	for	the	period	is:
																																																																													Expenditures	for	capital	outlay
5,757,666
										
																																																																													Depreciation	expense
								
(6,502,751)
																																																																													Net:
Repayment	of	principal	on	long‐term	liabilities	is	an	expenditure	in	the	governmental	funds,	but	the	
repayment	reduces	long‐term	liabilities	in	the	statement	of	net	position.
In	governmental	funds,	proceeds	from	issuance	of	long‐term	debt	are	reported	as	other	financing	sources.
In	the	government	wide	statements,	proceeds	from	debt	are	reported	as	increases	to	liabilities.		Amounts
recognized	in	governmental	funds	as	proceeds	from	debt,	net	of	issue	premium,	were:
Deferred	amounts	on	refunding	represent	amounts	paid	to	an	escrow	agent	in	excess	of	the	outstanding
debt	at	the	time	of	the	payment	for	refunded	bonds	which	have	been	defeased.		In	governmental	funds
these	amounts	are	recognized	as	an	expenditure.		However,	in	the	statement	of	activities,	these	amounts
are	amortized	over	the	life	of	the	refunded	debt.		The	difference	between	current	year	amounts	and	the
current	year	amortization	is:
In	governmental	funds,	accreted	interest	is	not	recorded	as	an	expenditure	from	current	resources.
In	the	government‐wide	statement	of	activities,	however,	this	is	recorded	as	interest	expense	for	the
period.	The	difference	between	accreted	interest	accrued	during	the	year	and	accreted	interest	paid	is:
In	governmental	funds,	if	debt	is	issued	at	a	premium,	the	premium	is	recognized	as	an	Other	
Financing	Source	in	the	period	it	is	incurred.		In	the	government‐wide	statements,	the	premium	
is	amortized	as	interest	over	the	life	of	the	debt.		Amortization	of	premium	for	the	period	is:
In	governmental	funds,	other	postemployment	benefits	(OPEB)	costs	are	recognized	when	employer
contributions	are	made.		In	the	statement	of	activites,	OPEB	costs	are	recognized	on	the	accrual	basis.		
This	year,	the	difference	between	OPEB	costs	and	actual	employer	contributions	was:
In	governmental	funds,	interest	on	long‐term	debt	is	recognized	in	the	period	that	it	becomes	due.
In	the	government‐wide	statement	of	activities,	it	is	recognized	in	the	period	that	it	is	incurred.
Unmatured	interest	owing	at	the	end	of	the	period,	less	matured	interest	paid	during	the	period,	
but	owing	from	the	prior	period,	is:
In	governmental	funds,	interest	subsidies	received	from	Build	America	Bonds	are	recognized
in	the	period	that	they	are	received.	In	the	government‐wide	statements,	they	are	recognized	in	the
period	that	they	are	earned.
In	the	statement	of	activities,	certain	operating	expenses	‐	such	as	compensated	absences	and	
early	retirement	incentives,	for	example,	are	measured	by	the	amounts	earned	during	the	year.
In	the	governmental	funds,	however,	expenditures	for	these	items	are	measured	by	the	amount
of	financial	resources	used	(essentially,	the	amounts	actually	paid).		The	difference	between
compensated	absenses	and	early	retirement	incentives	paid	and	earned	was:
In	government	funds,	pension	costs	are	recognized	when	employer	contributions	are	made.	in	the	
statement	of	activities,	pension	costs	are	recognized	on	the	accrual	basis.	This	year,	the	difference	
between	accrual‐basis	pension	costs	and	actual	employer	contributions	was:

NOTE	1	–	SUMMARY	OF	SIGNIFICANT	ACCOUNTING	POLICIES	

BONITA	UNIFIED	SCHOOL	DISTRICT	
Notes	to	Financial	Statements	
June	30,	2015	

		
	Bonita	Unified	School	District	(the	"District")	accounts	for	its	financial	transactions	in	accordance	with	the	
policies	and	procedures	of	the	California	Department	of	Education's	California	School	Accounting	Manual.		The	
accounting	policies	of	the	District	conform	to	accounting	principles	generally	accepted	in	the	United	States	of	
America	as	prescribed	by	the	Governmental	Accounting	Standards	Board.		The	following	is	a	summary	of	the	
more	significant	policies:	
	
A	reporting	entity	is	comprised	of	the	primary	government,	component	units,	and	other	organizations	
that	are	included	to	ensure	the	financial	statements	are	not	misleading.		The	primary	government	of	the	
District	consists	of	all	funds,	departments,	and	agencies	that	are	not	legally	separate	from	the	District.		For	
Bonita	Unified	School	District,	this	includes	general	operations,	food	service,	and	student	related	activities	
of	the	District.			
	Component	units	are	legally	separate	organizations	for	which	the	District	is	financially	accountable.		
Component	units	may	also	include	organizations	that	are	fiscally	dependent	on	the	District,	in	that	the	
District	approves	their	budget,	the	issuance	of	their	debt	or	the	levying	of	their	taxes.		In	addition,	
component	units	are	other	legally	separate	organizations	for	which	the	District	is	not	financially	
accountable	but	the	nature	and	significance	of	the	organization's	relationship	with	the	District	is	such	that	
exclusion	would	cause	the	District's	financial	statements	to	be	misleading	or	incomplete.			
	The	District	has	identified	no	organizations	that	are	required	to	be	reported	as	component	units.	
	
The	statement	of	net	position	and	the	statement	of	activities	display	information	about	the	primary	
government	(the	District).	
	These	statements	include	the	financial	activities	of	the	overall	
government,	except	for	fiduciary	activities.		Eliminations	have	been	made	to	minimize	the	double‐
counting	of	internal	activities.		Governmental	activities	generally	are	financed	through	taxes,	
intergovernmental	revenues,	and	other	nonexchange	transactions.			
	The	statement	of	activities	presents	a	comparison	between	direct	expenses	and	program	revenues	for	
each	function	of	the	District's	governmental	activities.		Direct	expenses	are	those	that	are	specifically	
associated	with	a	program	or	function	and,	therefore,	are	clearly	identifiable	to	a	particular	function.		
Program	revenues	include	(a)	fees,	fines,	and	charges	paid	by	the	recipients	of	goods	or	services	
offered	by	the	programs	and	(b)	grants	and	contributions	that	are	restricted	to	meeting	the	
operational	or	capital	requirements	of	a	particular	program.		Revenues	that	are	not	classified	as	
program	revenues,	including	all	taxes,	are	presented	as	general	revenues.	
	
The	fund	financial	statements	provide	information	about	the	District's	funds,	including	its	fiduciary	
funds	(and	blended	component	units).		Separate	statements	for	each	fund	category	‐	governmental	
and	fiduciary	‐	are	presented.		The	emphasis	of	fund	financial	statements	is	on	major	governmental	
funds,	each	displayed	in	a	separate	column.		All	remaining	governmental	funds	are	aggregated	and	
reported	as	nonmajor	funds.

Major	Governmental	Funds	

Non‐Major	Governmental	Funds	

	
The	District	maintains	the	following	major	governmental	funds:	
General	Fund:	This	fund	is	the	general	operating	fund	of	the	District.		It	is	used	to	account	for	all	
financial	resources	except	those	required	to	be	accounted	for	in	another	fund.			
	
Building	Fund:		This	fund	is	used	to	account	for	the	acquisition	of	major	governmental	capital	
facilities	and	buildings	from	the	sale	of	general	obligation	bonds.	
Bond	Interest	and	Redemption	Fund:		This	Fund	is	used	to	account	for	the	accumulation	of	
resources	for,	and	the	repayment	of,	District	bonds,	interest,	and	related	costs.	
The	District	maintains	the	following	non‐major	governmental	funds:	
Child	Development	Fund:		This	fund	is	used	to	account	for	resources	committed	to	child	
development	programs	maintained	by	the	District.	
	
Cafeteria	Fund:		This	fund	is	used	to	account	for	revenues	received	and	expenditures	made	
to	operate	the	District's	food	service	operations.	
	
Capital	Facilities	Fund:		This	fund	is	used	to	account	for	resources	received	from	developer	
impact	fees	assessed	under	provisions	of	the	California	Environmental	Quality	Act.	
Special	Reserve	Fund	for	Capital	Outlay	Projects:		This	fund	is	used	to	account	for	funds	
set	aside	for	Board	designated	construction	projects.	
Capital	Projects	Funds	for	Blended	Component	Units:		This	fund	is	used	to	account	for	the	
activity	of	the	maintenance	assessment	district.	
	
Fiduciary	fund	reporting	focuses	on	net	position	and	changes	in	Net	Position.		Fiduciary	funds	are	used	
to	report	assets	held	in	a	trustee	or	agency	capacity	for	others	and	therefore	cannot	be	used	to	support	
the	District’s	own	programs.		The	fiduciary	fund	category	includes	pension	(and	other	employee	
benefit)	trust	funds,	investment	trust	funds,	private‐purpose	trust	funds,	and	agency	funds.

The	District	maintains	the	following	fiduciary	funds:	
Agency	Funds:	These	funds	are	used	to	account	for	assets	of	others	for	which	the	District	acts	as	
an	agent.	The	"due	to	regulatory	agencies"	account	within	the	payroll	clearing	fund	is	used	to	
record	dedicated	funds	for	payroll	and	related	expenses.	The	District	also	maintains	student	body	
funds,	which	are	used	to	account	for	the	raising	and	expending	of	money	to	promote	the	general	
welfare,	morale,	and	educational	experience	of	the	student	body.	The	amounts	reported	for	
student	body	funds	represent	the	combined	totals	of	all	schools	within	the	District	that	maintain	
a	student	body	fund.	
	
The	government‐wide	and	fiduciary	fund	financial	statements	are	reported	using	the	economic	
resources	measurement	focus	and	the	accrual	basis	of	accounting.		Revenues	are	recorded	when	
earned	and	expenses	are	recorded	at	the	time	liabilities	are	incurred,	regardless	of	when	the	related	
cash	flows	take	place.		Nonexchange	transactions,	in	which	the	District	gives	(or	receives)	value	
without	directly	receiving	(or	giving)	equal	value	in	exchange,	include	property	taxes,	grants,	
entitlements,	and	donations.		On	an	accrual	basis,	revenue	from	property	taxes	is	recognized	in	the	
fiscal	year	in	which	all	eligibility	requirements	have	been	satisfied.	
	
Governmental	funds	are	reported	using	the	current	financial	resources	measurement	focus	and	the	
modified	accrual	basis	of	accounting.		Under	this	method,	revenues	are	recognized	when	measurable	
and	available.		Expenditures	are	recorded	when	the	related	fund	liability	is	incurred,	except	for	
principal	and	interest	on	general	long‐term	debt,	claims	and	judgments,	and	compensated	absences,	
which	are	recognized	as	expenditures	to	the	extent	they	have	matured.		Capital	asset	acquisitions	are	
reported	as	expenditures	in	governmental	funds.		Proceeds	of	general	long‐term	debt	and	financing	
from	capital	leases	are	reported	as	other	financing	sources.	
	
Revenue	resulting	from	exchange	transactions,	in	which	each	party	gives	and	receives	essentially	
equal	value,	is	recorded	on	the	accrual	basis	when	the	exchange	takes	place.		On	a	modified	accrual	
basis,	revenue	is	recorded	in	the	fiscal	year	in	which	the	resources	are	measurable	and	become	
available.		Available		means	that	the	resources	will	be	collected	within	the	current	fiscal	year.		
Generally,	available	is	defined	as	collectible	within	60	days.		However,	to	achieve	comparability	of	
reporting	among	California	districts	and	so	as	not	to	distort	normal	revenue	patterns,	with	specific	
respect	to	reimbursement	grants	and	corrections	to	state‐aid	apportionments,	the	California	
Department	of	Education	has	defined	available	for	districts	as	collectible	within	one	year.		The	
following	revenue	sources	are	considered	to	be	both	measurable	and	available	at	fiscal	year‐end:		
State	apportionments,	interest,	certain	grants,	and	other	local	sources.

3.  Revenues	‐	Exchange	and	Non‐Exchange	Transactions	(continued)	

	
	
Non‐exchange	transactions,	in	which	the	District	receives	value	without	directly	giving	equal	value	in	
return,	include	property	taxes,	certain	grants,	entitlements,	and	donations.		Revenue	from	property	
taxes	is	recognized	in	the	fiscal	year	in	which	the	taxes	are	received.		Revenue	from	certain	grants,	
entitlements,	and	donations	is	recognized	in	the	fiscal	year	in	which	all	eligibility	requirements	have	
been	satisfied.		Eligibility	requirements	include	time	and	purpose	requirements.		On	a	modified	
accrual	basis,	revenue	from	non‐exchange	transactions	must	also	be	available	before	it	can	be	
recognized.	
	
The	budgetary	process	is	prescribed	by	provisions	of	the	California	 Education	 Code	and	requires	the	
governing	board	to	hold	a	public	hearing	and	adopt	an	operating	budget	no	later	than	July	1	of	each	year.		
The	District	governing	board	satisfied	these	requirements.		The	adopted	budget	is	subject	to	amendment	
throughout	the	year	to	give	consideration	to	unanticipated	revenue	and	expenditures	primarily	resulting	
from	events	unknown	at	the	time	of	budget	adoption	with	the	legal	restriction	that	expenditures	cannot	
exceed	appropriations	by	major	object	account.	
	The	amounts	reported	as	the	original	budgeted	amounts	in	the	budgetary	statements	reflect	the	amounts	
when	the	original	appropriations	were	adopted.		The	amounts	reported	as	the	final	budgeted	amounts	in	
the	budgetary	statements	reflect	the	amounts	after	all	budget	amendments	have	been	accounted	for.		For	
budget	purposes,	on	behalf	payments	have	not	been	included	as	revenue	and	expenditures	as	required	
under	generally	accepted	accounting	principles.	
Encumbrance	accounting	is	used	in	all	budgeted	funds	to	reserve	portions	of	applicable	appropriations	
for	which	commitments	have	been	made.		Encumbrances	are	recorded	for	purchase	orders,	contracts,	and	
other	commitments	when	they	are	written.		Encumbrances	are	liquidated	when	the	commitments	are	
paid.		All	encumbrances	are	liquidated	as	of	June	30.	
	
	
The	District	considers	cash	and	cash	equivalents	to	be	cash	on	hand	and	demand	deposits.		In	
addition,	because	the	Treasury	Pool	is	sufficiently	liquid	to	permit	withdrawal	of	cash	at	any	time	
without	prior	notice	or	penalty,	equity	in	the	pool	is	also	deemed	to	be	a	cash	equivalent.	
	
Inventories	are	valued	at	cost	using	the	first‐in/first‐out	(FIFO)	method.		The	costs	of	governmental	
fund‐type	inventories	are	recorded	as	expenditures	when	consumed	rather	than	when	purchased.	
	
Purchased	or	constructed	capital	assets	are	reported	at	cost	or	estimated	historical	cost.		Donated	
fixed	assets	are	recorded	at	their	estimated	fair	value	at	the	date	of	donation.		The	cost	of	normal	
maintenance	and	repairs	that	do	not	add	to	the	value	of	the	asset	or	materially	extend	assets'	lives	
are	not	capitalized.

Unearned	revenue	arises	when	potential	revenue	does	not	meet	both	the	"measurable"	and	
"available"	criteria	for	recognition	in	the	current	period	or	when	resources	are	received	by	the	
District	prior	to	the	incurrence	of	qualifying	expenditures.		In	subsequent	periods,	when	both	
revenue	recognition	criteria	are	met,	or	when	the	District	has	a	legal	claim	to	the	resources,	the	
liability	for	unearned	revenue	is	removed	from	the	combined	balance	sheet	and	revenue	is	
recognized.	
	Certain	grants	received	that	have	not	met	eligibility	requirements	are	recorded	as	unearned	revenue.	
On	the	governmental	fund	financial	statements,	receivables	that	will	not	be	collected	within	the	
available	period	are	also	recorded	as	unearned	revenue.

In	addition	to	assets,	the	statement	of	net	position	will	sometimes	report	a	separate	section	for	
deferred	outflows	of	resources.		This	separate	financial	statement	element,	 deferred	 outflows	 of	
resources,	represents	a	consumption	of	net	position	that	applies	to	a	future	period	and	so	will	not	be	
recognized	as	an	outflow	of	resources	(expense/expenditure)	until	then.		The	District	has	two	items	
that	qualify	for	reporting	in	this	category.		The	first	item	is	to	recognize	contributions	made	to	the	
pension	plan	after	the	measurement	date	of	the	net	pension	liability.		The	second	is	deferred	amount	
on	refunding,	which	resulted	from	the	difference	in	the	carrying	value	of	refunded	debt	and	its	
reacquisition	price.		This	amount	is	shown	as	deferred	and	amortized	over	the	shorter	of	the	life	of	
the	refunded	or	refunding	debt.	
	In	addition	to	liabilities,	the	statement	of	net	position	will	sometimes	report	a	separate	section	for	
deferred	inflows	of	resources.		This	separate	financial	statement	element,	 deferred	 inflows	 of	
resources,	represents	an	acquisition	of	net	position	that	applies	to	a	future	period	and	will	not	be	
recognized	as	an	inflow	of	resources	(revenue)	until	that	time.		The	District	has	one	item	that	is	
reported	as	deferred	inflows	of	resources.		That	item	is	to	recognize	the	District's	proportionate	share	
of	the	deferred	inflows	of	resources	related	to	its	pension	plans	as	more	fully	described	in	the	
footnote	entitled	"Pension	Plans".	
	
Accumulated	unpaid	vacation	benefits	are	accrued	as	a	liability	on	the	government‐wide	statement	of	
net	assets	as	the	benefits	are	earned.		For	governmental	funds,	unpaid	compensated	absences	are	
recognized	as	a	fund	liability	only	upon	the	occurrence	of	relevant	events	such	as	employee	
resignation	and	retirements	that	occur	prior	to	year	end	that	have	not	yet	been	paid	with	expendable	
available	financial	resources.		These	amounts	are	recorded	as	accounts	payable	in	the	fund	from	
which	the	employees	who	have	accumulated	leave	are	paid.	
	Accumulated	sick	leave	benefits	are	not	recognized	as	liabilities	of	the	District.	The	District's	policy	is	
to	record	sick	leave	as	an	operating	expense	in	the	period	taken	because	such	benefits	do	not	vest,	
nor	is	payment	probable.	Unused	sick	leave	is	added	to	the	creditable	service	period	for	calculation	of	
retirement	benefits	when	the	employee	retires.	
	
For	purposes	of	measuring	the	net	pension	liability	and	deferred	outflows/inflows	of	resources	
related	to	pensions,	and	pension	expense,	information	about	the	fiduciary	net	position	of	the	
District's	California	State	Teachers	Retirement	System	(CalSTRS)	and	California	Public	Employees'	
Retirement	System	(CalPERS)	plans	and	addition	to/deductions	from	the	Plans'	fiduciary	net	position	
have	been	determined	on	the	same	basis	as	they	are	reported	by	CalSTRS	and	CalPERS.		For	this	
purpose,	benefit	payments	(including	refunds	of	employee	contributions)	are	recognized	when	due	
and	payable	in	accordance	with	the	benefit	terms.		Investments	are	reported	at	fair	value.	
	
The	fund	balance	for	governmental	funds	is	reported	in	classifications	based	on	the	extent	to	which	
the	government	is	bound	to	honor	constraints	on	the	specific	purposes	for	which	amounts	in	those	
funds	can	be	spent.

Nonspendable:		Fund	balance	is	reported	as	nonspendable	when	the	resources	cannot	be	spent	
because	they	are	either	in	a	nonspendable	form	or	legally	or	contractually	required	to	be	maintained	
intact.		Resources	in	nonspendable	form	include	inventories	and	prepaid	assets.	
	
Restricted:		Fund	balance	is	reported	as	restricted	when	the	constraints	placed	on	the	use	of	
resources	are	either	externally	imposed	by	creditors,	grantors,	contributors,	or	laws	or	regulations	of	
other	governments;	or	imposed	by	law	through	constitutional	provision	or	by	enabling	legislation.	
	
Committed:		The	District's	highest	decision‐making	level	of	authority	rests	with	the	District's	Board.		
Fund	balance	is	reported	as	committed	when	the	Board	passes	a	resolution	that	places	specified	
constraints	on	how	resources	may	be	used.		The	Board	can	modify	or	rescind	a	commitment	of	
resources	through	passage	of	a	new	resolution.	
	
Assigned:		Resources	that	are	constrained	by	the	District's	intent	to	use	them	for	a	specific	purpose,	
but	are	neither	restricted	nor	committed,	are	reported	as	assigned	fund	balance.		Intent	may	be	
expressed	by	either	the	Board,	committees	(such	as	budget	or	finance),	or	officials	to	which	the	Board	
has	delegated	authority.	
	
Unassigned:		Unassigned	fund	balance	represents	fund	balance	that	has	not	been	restricted,	
committed,	or	assigned	and	may	be	utilized	by	the	District	for	any	purpose.		When	expenditures	are	
incurred,	and	both	restricted	and	unrestricted	resources	are	available,	it	is	the	District's	policy	to	use	
restricted	resources	first,	then	unrestricted	resources	in	the	order	of	committed,	assigned,	and	then	
unassigned,	as	they	are	needed.	
	
Net	position	is	classified	into	three	components:	net	investment	in	capital	assets;	restricted;	and	unrestricted.	
	These	classifications	are	defined	as	follows:	
  Net	investment	in	capital	assets	‐	This	component	of	net	position	consists	of	capital	assets,	
including	restricted	capital	assets,	net	of	accumulated	depreciation	and	reduced	by	the	
outstanding	balances	of	any	bonds,	mortgages,	notes,	or	other	borrowings	that	are	
attributable	to	the	acquisition,	construction,	or	improvement	of	those	assets.		If	there	are	
significant	unspent	related	debt	proceeds	at	year‐end,	the	portion	of	the	debt	attributable	to	
the	unspent	proceeds	are	not	included	in	the	calculation	of	net	investment	in	capital	assets.		
Rather,	that	portion	of	the	debt	is	included	in	the	same	net	position	component	as	the	
unspent	proceeds.	
  Restricted	‐	This	component	of	net	position	consists	of	constraints	placed	on	net	position	
use	through	external	constraints	imposed	by	creditors	(such	as	through	debt	covenants),	
grantors,	contributors,	or	laws	or	regulations	of	other	governments	or	constraints	imposed	
by	law	through	constitutional	provisions	or	enabling	legislation.	
  Unrestricted	 net	 position	‐	This	component	of	net	position	consists	of	net	position	that	
does	not	meet	the	definition	of	"net	investment	in	capital	assets"	or	"restricted".	
When	both	restricted	and	unrestricted	resources	are	available	for	use,	it	is	the	District's	policy	to	use	
restricted	resources	first,	then	unrestricted	resources	as	they	are	needed.

F.  Minimum	Fund	Balance	Policy	

NOTE	1	–	SUMMARY	OF	SIGNIFICANT	ACCOUNTING	POLICIES	(continued)	

During	the	2010‐11	fiscal	year,	pursuant	to	GASB	Statement	No.	54,	the	District	adopted	a	minimum	fund	
balance	policy	for	the	General	Fund	in	order	to	protect	the	District	against	revenue	shortfalls	or	
unpredicted	expenditures.		The	policy	requires	a	Reserve	for	Economic	Uncertainties	consisting	of	equal	
to	no	less	than	three	percent	of	total	General	Fund	expenditures	and	other	financing	uses.	
	The	Fund	Balance	Policy	establishes	a	minimum	Unassigned	Fund	Balance	equal	to	7%	of	total	General	
Fund	expenditures.		In	the	event	that	the	balance	drops	below	the	established	minimum	level,	the	
District's	Board	of	Education	will	develop	a	plan	to	replenish	the	fund	balance	to	the	established	
minimum	level.	
	When	an	expenditure	is	incurred	for	purposes	for	which	both	restricted	and	unrestricted	fund	balance	is	
available,	the	District	considers	restricted	funds	to	have	been	spent	first.		When	an	expenditure	is	
incurred	for	which	committed,	assigned,	or	unassigned	fund	balances	are	available,	the	District	considers	
amounts	to	have	been	spent	first	out	of	committed	funds,	then	assigned	funds,	and	finally	unassigned	
funds,	as	needed	unless	the	governing	board	has	provided	otherwise	in	its	commitment	or	assignment	
actions.		
The	County	is	responsible	for	the	assessment,	collection,	and	apportionment	of	property	taxes	for	all	
jurisdictions	including	the	schools	and	special	districts	within	the	County.		The	Board	of	Supervisors	
levies	property	taxes	as	of	September	1	on	property	values	assessed	on	July	1.		Secured	property	tax	
payments	are	due	in	two	equal	installments.		The	first	is	generally	due	November	1	and	is	delinquent	with	
penalties	on	December	10,	and	the	second	is	generally	due	on	February	1	and	is	delinquent	with	penalties	
on	April	10.		Secured	property	taxes	become	a	lien	on	the	property	on	January	1.	
The	preparation	of	financial	statements	in	conformity	with	generally	accepted	accounting	principles	
requires	management	to	make	estimates	and	assumptions	that	affect	the	reported	amounts	of	assets	and	
liabilities	and	disclosure	of	contingent	assets	and	liabilities	at	the	date	of	the	financial	statements	and	the	
reported	amounts	of	revenues	and	expenditures	during	the	reported	period.		Actual	results	could	differ	
from	those	estimates.	
During	the	2014‐15	fiscal	year,	the	following	GASB	Pronouncements	became	effective:	
	
The	primary	objective	of	this	Statement	is	to	improve	accounting	and	financial	reporting	by	state	and	
local	governments	for	pensions.	It	also	improves	information	provided	by	state	and	local	
governmental	employers	about	financial	support	for	pensions	that	is	provided	by	other	entities.	This	
Statement	results	from	a	comprehensive	review	of	the	effectiveness	of	existing	standards	of	
accounting	and	financial	reporting	for	pensions	with	regard	to	providing	decision‐useful	information,	
supporting	 assessments	 of	 accountability	 and	
interperiod	 equity,	 and	 creating	 additional	
transparency.

1.  Statement	No.	68	(continued)	
This	Statement	replaces	the	requirements	of	Statement	No.	27,	Accounting	for	Pensions	by	State	and	
Local	Governmental	Employers,	as	well	as	the	requirements	of	Statement	No.	50,	Pension	Disclosures,	
as	they	relate	to	pensions	that	are	provided	through	pension	plans	administered	as	trusts	or	
equivalent	arrangements	(hereafter	jointly	referred	to	as	trusts)	that	meet	certain	criteria.	
	This	Statement	establishes	standards	for	measuring	and	recognizing	liabilities,	deferred	outflows	of	
resources,	and	deferred	inflows	of	resources,	and	expense/expenditures.	For	defined	benefit	
pensions,	this	Statement	identifies	the	methods	and	assumptions	that	should	be	used	to	project	
benefit	payments,	discount	projected	benefit	payments	to	their	actuarial	present	value,	and	attribute	
that	present	value	to	periods	of	employee	service.	
	
In	financial	statements	prepared	using	the	economic	resources	measurement	focus	and	accrual	basis	
of	accounting,	a	cost‐sharing	employer	that	does	not	have	a	special	funding	situation	is	required	to	
recognize	a	liability	for	its	proportionate	share	of	the	net	pension	liability	(of	all	employers	for	
benefits	provided	through	the	pension	plan)—the	collective	net	pension	liability.	An	employer’s	
proportion	is	required	to	be	determined	on	a	basis	that	is	consistent	with	the	manner	in	which	
contributions	to	the	pension	plan	are	determined,	and	consideration	should	be	given	to	separate	
rates,	if	any,	related	to	separate	portions	of	the	collective	net	pension	liability.	The	use	of	the	
employer’s	projected	long‐term	contribution	effort	as	compared	to	the	total	projected	long‐term	
contribution	effort	of	all	employers	as	the	basis	for	determining	an	employer’s	proportion	is	
encouraged.	
	A	cost‐sharing	employer	is	required	to	recognize	pension	expense	and	report	deferred	outflows	of	
resources	and	deferred	inflows	of	resources	related	to	pensions	for	its	proportionate	shares	of	
collective	pension	expense	and	collective	deferred	outflows	of	resources	and	deferred	inflows	of	
resources	related	to	pensions.	
The	objective	of	this	Statement	is	to	address	an	issue	regarding	application	of	the	transition	
provisions	of	Statement	No.	68,	Accounting	and	Financial	Reporting	for	Pensions.		The	issue	relates	to	
amounts	associated	with	contributions,	if	any,	made	by	a	state	or	local	government	employer	or	
nonemployer	contributing	entity	to	a	defined	benefit	pension	plan	after	the	measurement	date	of	the	
government's	beginning	net	pension	liability.	
	Statement	68	requires	a	state	or	local	government	employer	(or	nonemployer	contributing	entity	in	a	
special	funding	situation)	to	recognize	a	net	position	liability	measured	as	of	a	date	(the	
measurement	date)	no	earlier	than	the	end	of	its	prior	fiscal	year.		If	a	state	or	local	government	
employer	or	nonemployer	contributing	entity	makes	a	contribution	to	a	defined	benefit	pension	plan	
between	the	measurement	date	of	the	reported	net	pension	liability	and	the	end	of	the	government's	
reporting	period,	Statement	68	requires	that	the	government	recognize	its	contribution	as	a	deferred	
outflow	of	resources.		In	addition,	Statement	68	requires	recognition	of	deferred	outflows	of	
resources	and	deferred	inflows	of	resources	for	changes	in	the	net	pension	liability	of	a	state	or	local	
government	employer	or	nonemployer	contributing	entity	that	arise	from	other	types	of	events.

NOTE	1	–	SUMMARY	OF	SIGNIFICANT	ACCOUNTING	POLICIES	(continued)	

I.  New	GASB	Pronouncements	(continued)	

2.  Statement	No.	71	(continued)	

At	transition	to	Statement	68,	if	it	is	not	practical	for	an	employer	or	nonemployer	contributing	entity	
to	determine	the	amounts	of	 all	deferred	outflows	of	resources	and	deferred	inflows	of	resources	
related	to	pensions,	paragraph	137	of	Statement	68	required	that	beginning	balances	for	deferred	
outflows	of	resources	and	deferred	inflows	of	resources	not	be	reported.	
	Consequently,	if	it	is	not	practical	to	determine	the	amounts	of	all	deferred	outflows	of	resources	and	
deferred	inflows	of	resources	related	to	pensions,	contributions	made	after	the	measurement	date	of	
the	beginning	net	pension	liability	could	not	have	been	reported	as	deferred	outflows	of	resources	at	
transition.		This	could	have	resulted	in	a	significant	understatement	of	an	employer	or	nonemployer	
contributing	entity's	beginning	net	position	and	expense	in	the	initial	period	of	implementation.	
	This	Statement	amends	paragraph	137	of	Statement	68	to	require	that,	at	transition,	a	government	
recognize	a	beginning	deferred	outflow	of	resources	for	its	pension	contributions,	if	any,	made	
subsequent	to	the	measurement	date	of	the	beginning	net	pension	liability.		Statement	68,	as	
amended,	continues	to	require	that	beginning	balances	for	other	deferred	outflows	of	resources	and	
deferred	inflows	of	resources	related	to	pensions	be	reported	at	transition	only	if	it	is	practical	to	
determine	all	such	amounts.	
	The	provisions	of	this	Statement	are	required	to	be	applied	simultaneously	with	the	provisions	of	
Statement	68.	
	
3.  Cumulative	Effect	of	Change	in	Accounting	Principle	
Accounting	changes	adopted	to	conform	to	the	provisions	of	these	statements	should	be	applied	
retroactively.		The	result	of	the	implementation	of	these	standards	was	to	decrease	the	net	position	at	
July	1,	2014,	by	$76,381,453,	which	is	the	amount	of	net	pension	liability,	net	of	the	deferred	outflows	
of	resources	related	to	pensions	at	July	1,	2014.

Investment	security	ratings	reported	as	of	June	30,	2015,	are	defined	by	Standard	and	Poors.	
	
In	accordance	with	Education	Code	Section	41001,	the	District	maintains	substantially	all	of	its	cash	in	the	
County	Treasury.		The	County	pools	and	invests	the	cash.		These	pooled	funds	are	carried	at	cost	which	
approximates	fair	value.		Interest	earned	is	deposited	annually	to	participating	funds.		Any	investment	losses	
are	proportionately	shared	by	all	funds	in	the	pool.	
	Because	the	District's	deposits	are	maintained	in	a	recognized	pooled	investment	fund	under	the	care	of	a	
third	party	and	the	District's	share	of	the	pool	does	not	consist	of	specific,	identifiable	investment	securities	
owned	by	the	District,	no	disclosure	of	the	individual	deposits	and	investments	or	related	custodial	credit	risk	
classifications	is	required.	
	In	accordance	with	applicable	state	laws,	the	County	Treasurer	may	invest	in	derivative	securities	with	the	
State	of	California.		However,	at	June	30,	2015,	the	County	Treasurer	has	represented	that	the	Pooled	
Investment	Fund	contained	no	derivatives	or	other	investments	with	similar	risk	profiles.	
	
Custodial	credit	risk	is	the	risk	that	in	the	event	of	a	bank	failure,	the	District’s	deposits	may	not	be	returned	
to	it.		The	District	does	not	have	a	policy	for	custodial	credit	risk	for	deposits.		Cash	balances	held	in	banks	are	
insured	up	to	$250,000	by	the	Federal	Depository	Insurance	Corporation	(FDIC)	and	are	collateralized	by	the	
respective	financial	institutions.		In	addition,	the	California	Government	Code	requires	that	a	financial	
institution	secure	deposits	made	by	State	or	local	governmental	units	by	pledging	securities	in	an	undivided	
collateral	pool	held	by	a	depository	regulated	under	State	law	(unless	so	waived	by	the	governmental	unit).		
The	market	value	of	the	pledged	securities	in	the	collateral	pool	must	equal	at	least	110	percent	of	the	total	
amount	deposited	by	the	public	agencies.		California	law	also	allows	financial	institutions	to	secure	public	
deposits	by	pledging	first	trust	deed	mortgage	notes	having	a	value	of	150	percent	of	the	secured	public	
deposits	and	letters	of	credit	issued	by	the	Federal	Home	Loan	Bank	of	San	Francisco	having	a	value	of	105	
percent	of	the	secured	deposits.

As	of	June	30,	2015,	$105,573	of	the	District’s	bank	balance	was	exposed	to	custodial	credit	risk	because	it	
was	uninsured	and	collateralized	with	securities	held	by	the	pledging	financial	institution’s	trust	department	
or	agency,	but	not	in	the	name	of	the	District.	
	
Investments	‐	Interest	Rate	Risk		
The	District's	investment	policy	limits	investment	maturities	as	a	means	of	managing	its	exposure	to	fair	value	
losses	arising	from	increasing	interest	rates.		The	District's	investment	policy	limits	investment	purchases	to	
investments	with	a	term	not	to	exceed	three	years.		Investments	purchased	with	maturity	terms	greater	than	
three	years	require	approval	by	the	Board	of	Education.		Investments	purchased	with	maturities	greater	than	
one	year	require	written	approval	by	the	Superintendent	prior	to	commitment.		Maturities	of	investments	
held	at	June	30,	2015,	consist	of	the	following:

commercial	paper,	certificates	of	deposit,	repurchase	agreements,	corporate	notes,	banker	acceptances,	and	
other	securities	allowed	by	State	Government	Code	Section	53600.		At	June	30,	2015,	all	investments

With	respect	to	the	bonds,	the	District	expects	to	receive,	on	or	about	each	bond	payment	date	for	the	
bonds,	a	cash	subsidy	payment	from	the	United	States	Treasury	equal	to	the	lesser	of	a)	the	interest	
payable	on	such	bond	payment	date	or	b)	the	amount	of	interest	that	would	have	been	payable	on	such	
bond	payment	date	on	such	bonds	if	such	interest	were	determined	at	a	federal	tax	credit	rate	applicable	
to	the	bonds,	which	Tax	Credit	Rate	is	published	by	the	Treasury	and	determined	under	Section	
54A(b)(3)	of	the	Code.		Prior	to	each	such	bond	payment	date	for	the	bonds,	the	District	will	submit	or	
cause	to	be	submitted	to	the	Treasury	a	subsidy	reimbursement	request	in	accordance	with	applicable	
Federal	regulations.			
	Upon	receipt	of	such	Subsidy	Payment,	the	District	shall	deposit	or	cause	to	be	deposited	any	such	cash	
Subsidy	Payment	into	the	Debt	Service	Fund	for	the	bonds	maintained	by	the	County.		The	Subsidy	
Payment	does	not	constitute	a	full	faith	and	credit	guarantee	of	the	United	States	Government,	but	is	
required	to	be	paid	by	the	United	States	Treasury	under	the	HIRE	Act.	
	
On	March	21,	2012,	the	District	issued	$22,530,000	of	General	Obligation	Refunding	Bonds.	The	Bonds	
consist	of	serial	bonds	bearing	fixed	rates	ranging	from	2.0%	to	5.0%	with	annual	maturities	from	August	
2012	through	August	2028.		The	net	proceeds	of	$26,006,991	(after	issuance	costs	and	underwriter’s	
discount	of	$194,131	and	original	issue	premium	of	$3,671,122)	were	used	to	refund	a	portion	of	the	
District’s	outstanding	General	Obligation	Bonds,	Election	of	2004,	Series	A.		Deferred	amounts	on	
refunding	as	of	June	30,	2015,	of	$2,270,463	remain	to	be	amortized.	
	
On	October	2,	2014,	the	District	issued	$25,255,000	of	General	Obligation	Refunding	Bonds.	The	bonds	
bear	fixed	interest	rates	ranging	between	2.0%	and	5.0%	with	annual	maturities	from	August	1,	2015	
through	August	1,	2031.		The	net	proceeds	of	$27,201,109	(after	premiums	of	$2,194,674	and	issuance	
costs	of	$248,565)	were	used	to	advance	refund	a	portion	of	the	District’s	outstanding	General	Obligation	
Bonds	Series,	Election	of	2004,	Series	B.		
	The	net	proceeds	were	used	to	purchase	U.S.	government	securities.		Those	securities	were	deposited	into	
an	irrevocable	trust	with	an	escrow	agent	to	provide	for	future	debt	service	payments	on	the	refunded	
bonds.		As	a	result,	the	refunded	bonds	are	considered	to	be	defeased,	and	the	related	liability	for	the	
bonds	has	been	removed	from	the	District's	liabilities.		Amounts	paid	to	the	escrow	agent	in	excess	of	the	
outstanding	debt	at	the	time	of	payment	are	recorded	as	deferred	amounts	on	refunding	on	the	statement	
of	net	position	and	are	amortized	to	interest	expense	over	the	life	of	the	liability.		Deferred	amounts	on	
refunding	as	of	June	30,	2015,	of	$983,202	remain	to	be	amortized.		As	of	June	30,	2015,	the	principal	
balance	outstanding	on	the	defeased	debt	amounted	to	$25,025,000.	
	The	refunding	decreased	the	District's	total	debt	service	payments	by	$3,102,004.	The	transaction	
resulted	in	an	economic	gain	(difference	between	the	present	value	of	the	debt	service	on	the	old	and	the	
new	bonds)	of	$2,382,110.

The	District	will	receive	no	sublease	rental	revenues	nor	pay	any	contingent	rentals	for	the	copiers.	
Employees	who	reach	qualifying	age	and	have	performed	10	years	of	service	for	the	District	are	entitled	
to	an	annual	payment	for	10	years	or	until	Medicare	of	Social	Security	retirement	age	is	reached,	
whichever	comes	first.		The	amount	is	prorated	based	upon	the	percentage	of	full	time	employment.		
Previously	the	amount	was	$2,000	for	certificated	employees	and	$2,200	per	year	for	classified	
employees.		In	2007‐2008,	certificated	employees	were	offered	an	additional	$4,000	per	year	(for	a	total	
of	$6,000),	and	classified	employees	were	offered	an	additional	$1,000	per	year	(for	a	total	of	$3,200).	
	In	2008‐09,	certificated	employees	were	offered	one	of	two	retirement	incentives:	a)	$6,000	per	year	for	
no	more	than	10	years	or	b)	a	one‐time	cash	payment	of	20%	of	their	annual	contracted	salary	to	be	paid	
in	fiscal	year	2009‐10,	plus	$2,000	per	year	for	a	maximum	of	10	years	or	to	age	65.		Five	employees	
chose	to	receive	$6,000	per	year;	fifteen	chose	to	receive	20%	of	their	annual	salary	for	one	year	plus	
$2,000	per	year.		During	2009‐10,	the	District	extended	the	same	offer	as	in	the	previous	year.		Twelve	
employees	chose	to	receive	$6,000	per	year,	six	chose	to	receive	a	one‐time	payment	of	20%	of	their

D.  Early	Retirement	Incentives	(continued)	

In	2008‐09,	eleven	classified	employees	accepted	a	one	time	retirement	incentive	of	10%	of	their	base	
salary.		Eight	of	these	employees	will	receive	the	$2,200	per	year	for	a	maximum	of	10	years	or	until	they	
are	eligible	to	receive	full	Social	Security	benefits.		This	incentive	was	also	offered	during	2009‐10.		
Thirteen	employees	signed	up	for	this	incentive,	of	which	four	will	receive	only	the	incentive	equal	to	
10%	of	their	base	salary	because	they	already	reached	full	retirement	age.	
	In	2013‐14,	certificated	and	classified	employees	were	offered	a	retirement	incentive	of	up	to	25%	of	
employee's	contracted	base	salary.		Payments	will	be	made	in	two	installments;	one	in	October	2014	and	
one	in	March	2015.		Additionally,	certificated	employees	who	elected	to	retire	will	also	receive	$2,000	per	
year,	and	classified	employees	will	receive	$2,200	per	year	until	the	employee	is	eligible	for	social	
security.		In	total,	26	employees	elected	to	take	the	incentive.	
	Currently,	115	retirees	are	receiving	benefits	under	these	programs.		Expenditures	are	recognized	on	a	
pay‐as‐you‐go	basis,	as	employees	are	paid.		During	the	year,	expenditures	of	$628,816	were	incurred	for	
retiree	incentives.	
	The	estimated	future	liability	at	June	30,	2015,	is	$1,419,541.		This	was	estimated	by	multiplying	the	
number	of	retirees	receiving	benefits	by	the	annual	payment	for	each	retiree	and	by	the	number	of	years	
remaining	of	eligibility.	
		
	The	Bonita	Unified	School	District	participates	in	joint	ventures	under	a	joint	powers	agreement	(JPA)	with	
the	Alliance	of	Schools	for	Cooperative	Insurance	Program	(ASCIP)	and	Valley	Insurance	Programs	(VIP).		The	
relationships	between	the	Bonita	Unified	School	District	and	the	JPAs	are	such	that	the	JPA’s	are	not	a	
component	unit	of	the	District	for	financial	reporting	purposes.		
	The	JPA’s	provide	for	property,	liability	and	workers’	compensation	insurance	for	its	member	districts.		The	
JPA’s	are	governed	by	a	board	consisting	of	a	representative	from	each	member	district.		The	governing	board	
controls	the	operations	of	its	JPA’s	independent	of	any	influence	by	the	member	districts	beyond	their	
representation	on	the	governing	board.		Each	member	district	pays	a	premium	commensurate	with	the	level	
of	coverage	requested	and	shares	surpluses	and	deficits	proportionately	to	its	participation	in	the	JPA’s.			
	Condensed	audited	financial	information	for	the	year	ended	June	30,	2014	for	ASCIP	and	VIP	is	as	follows:

Settled	claims	have	not	exceeded	this	commercial	coverage	in	any	of	the	past	three	years.		There	has	not	been	
a	significant	reduction	in	coverage	from	the	prior	year.	
	
For	fiscal	year	2015,	the	District	participated	in	the	VIP	JPA	for	workers	compensation	up	to	$750,000	per	
claim	self	insured	retention,	with	excess	coverage	provided	by	the	JPA’s	excess	coverage	insurance	carrier,	
Hanover.		The	workers’	compensation	rate	as	a	percent	of	salary	is	determined	annually	based	on	an	actuarial	
study.	
	
For	fiscal	year	2015,	the	District	had	a	cap	of	$7,000	on	employer	paid	health	and	welfare	benefits.		The	
District	has	contracted	with	the	California	Public	Employment	Retirement	System	(CalPERS)	Health	Plan	and	
with	Kaiser	Permanente	to	provide	medical	and	surgical	benefits,	and	with	Delta	Care,	Delta	Dental,	and	
United	Concordia	for	dental	benefits.		Vision	benefits	are	provided	through	Vision	Service	Plan.		Disability	
insurance,	cancer	insurance,	and	accident	insurance	are	also	options	available	to	employees.	
		
NOTE	9	–	COMMITMENTS	AND	CONTINGENCIES	
	
The	District	has	received	state	and	federal	funds	for	specific	purposes	that	are	subject	to	review	and	audit	
by	the	grantor	agencies.		Although	such	audits	could	generate	expenditure	disallowances	under	terms	of	
the	grants,	it	is	believed	that	any	required	reimbursement	will	not	be	material.	
	
As	of	June	30,	2015,	the	District	had	commitments	with	respect	to	unfinished	capital	projects	of	
approximately	$1.9	million	to	be	paid	from	bond	funds	and	other	funds.	
	
The	District	is	involved	in	various	legal	matters.		In	the	opinion	of	legal	counsel,	the	District	does	not	
anticipate	that	the	outcome	of	any	of	the	matters	will	have	a	material	impact	on	the	financial	statements.

CalSTRS	provides	retirement,	disability,	and	death	benefits.	Retirement	benefits	are	determined	as	2	
percent	of	final	compensation	for	each	year	of	credited	service	at	age	60	for	members	under	CalSTRS	2%	
at	60,	or	age	62	for	members	under	CalSTRS	2%	at	62,	increasing	to	a	maximum	of	2.4	percent	at	age	63	
for	members	under	 CalSTRS	 2%	 at	 60,	or	age	65	for	members	under	 CalSTRS	 2%	 at	 62.		The	normal	
retirement	eligibility	requirements	are	age	60	for	members	under	 CalSTRS	 2%	 at	 60,	or	age	62	for	
members	under	CalSTRS	2%	at	62,	with	a	minimum	of	five	years	of	service	credited	under	the	Defined	
Benefit	Program,	which	can	include	service	purchased	from	teaching	in	an	out‐of‐state	or	foreign	public	
school.		Employees	are	eligible	for	service‐related	disability	benefits	after	five	years	of	service,	unless	the	
member	is	disabled	due	to	an	unlawful	act	of	bodily	injury	committed	by	another	person	while	working	in	
CalSTRS	covered	employment,	in	which	case	the	minimum	is	one	year.	Disability	benefits	are	equal	to	fifty	
percent	of	final	compensation	regardless	of	age	and	service	credit.		Designated	recipients	of	CalSTRS	
retired	members	receive	a	$6,163	lump‐sum	death	payment.		There	is	a	2	percent	simple	increase	each	
September	1	following	the	first	anniversary	of	the	date	on	which	the	monthly	benefit	began	to	accrue.	The	
annual	2	percent	increase	is	applied	to	all	continuing	benefits	other	than	Defined	Benefit	Supplement	
annuities.	However,	if	the	member	retires	with	a	Reduced	Benefit	Election,	the	increase	does	not	begin	to	
accrue	until	the	member	reaches	age	60	and	is	not	payable	until	the	member	receives	the	full	benefit.	This	
increase	is	also	known	as	the	improvement	factor.	
	CalPERS	also	provides	retirement,	disability,	and	death	benefits.	Retirement	benefits	are	determined	as	
1.1	percent	of	final	compensation	for	each	year	of	credited	service	at	age	50	for	members	under	2%	at	55,	
or	1.0	percent	at	age	52	for	members	under	2%	at	62,	increasing	to	a	maximum	of	2.5	percent	at	age	63	
for	members	under	2%	at	55,	or	age	67	for	members	under	2%	at	62.	To	be	eligible	for	service	retirement,	
members	must	be	at	least	age	50	and	have	a	minimum	of	five	years	of	CalPERS‐credited	service.	Members	
joining	on	or	after	January	1,	2013	must	be	at	least	age	52.		Disability	retirement	has	no	minimum	age	
requirement	and	the	disability	does	not	have	to	be	job	related.	However,	members	must	have	a	minimum	
of	five	years	of	CalPERS	service	credit.			
Pre‐retirement	death	benefits	range	from	a	simple	return	of	member	contributions	plus	interest	to	a	
monthly	allowance	equal	to	half	of	what	the	member	would	have	received	at	retirement	paid	to	a	spouse	
or	domestic	partner.	To	be	eligible	for	any	type	of	monthly	pre‐retirement	death	benefit,	a	spouse	or	
domestic	partner	must	have	been	either	married	to	the	member	or	legally	registered	before	the	
occurrence	of	the	injury	or	the	onset	of	the	illness	that	resulted	in	death,	or	for	at	least	one	year	prior	to	
death.		Cost‐of‐living	adjustments	are	provided	by	law	and	are	based	on	the	Consumer	Price	Index	for	all	
United	States	cities.	Cost‐of‐living	adjustments	are	paid	the	second	calendar	year	of	the	member’s	
retirement	on	the	May	1	check	and	then	every	year	thereafter.	The	standard	cost‐of‐living	adjustment	is	a	
maximum	of	2	percent	per	year.

CalSTRS	uses	custom	mortality	tables	to	best	fit	the	patterns	of	mortality	among	its	members.		These	
custom	tables	are	based	on	RP2000	series	tables	adjusted	to	fit	CalSTRS	experience.		RP2000	series	tables	
are	an	industry	standard	set	of	mortality	rates	published	by	the	Society	of	Actuaries.		See	CalSTRS	July	1,	
2006	‐	June	30,	2010	Experience	Analysis	for	more	information.		The	underlying	mortality	assumptions	
and	all	other	actuarial	assumptions	used	in	the	CalPERS	June	30,	2013	valuation	were	based	on	the	
results	of	a	January	2014	actuarial	experience	study	for	the	period	1997	to	2011.	Further	details	of	the	
Experience	Study	can	found	on	the	CalPERS	website.	
	
Discount	Rate	–	for	CalSTRS	
The	discount	rate	used	to	measure	the	total	pension	liability	was	7.60	percent.		The	projection	of	cash	
flows	used	to	determine	the	discount	rate	assumed	that	contributions	from	plan	members	and	employers	
will	be	made	at	statutory	contribution	rates	in	accordance	with	the	rate	increase	per	Assembly	Bill	1469.		
Projected	inflows	from	investment	earnings	were	calculated	using	the	long‐term	assumed	investment	
rate	of	return	(7.60	percent)	and	assuming	that	contributions,	benefit	payments,	and	administrative	
expense	occur	midyear.		Based	on	those	assumptions,	the	STRP's	fiduciary	net	position	was	projected	to	
be	available	to	make	all	projected	future	benefit	payments	to	current	plan	members.			
Therefore,	the	long‐term	assumed	investment	rate	of	return	was	applied	to	all	periods	of	projected	
benefit	payments	to	determine	the	total	pension	liability.	
	
Discount	Rate	–	for	CalPERS	
The	discount	rate	used	to	measure	the	total	pension	liability	was	7.50%	for	CalPERS.		To	determine	
whether	the	municipal	bond	rate	should	be	used	in	the	calculation	of	a	discount	rate	for	each	plan,	
CalPERS	stress	tested	plans	that	would	most	likely	result	in	a	discount	rate	that	would	be	different	from	
the	actuarially	assumed	discount	rate.		Based	on	the	testing,	none	of	the	tested	plans	run	out	of	assets.	
Therefore,	the	current	7.50	percent	discount	rate	is	adequate	and	the	use	of	the	municipal	bond	rate	
calculation	is	not	necessary.		he	long	term	expected	discount	rate	of	7.50	percent	will	be	applied	to	all	
plans	in	the	Public	Employees	Retirement	Fund	(PERF).		The	stress	test	results	are	presented	in	a	detailed	
report	that	can	be	obtained	from	the	CalPERS	website.	
	According	to	Paragraph	30	of	Statement	68,	the	long‐term	discount	rate	should	be	determined	without	
reduction	for	pension	plan	administrative	expense.		The	7.50	percent	investment	return	assumption	used	
in	this	accounting	valuation	is	net	of	administrative	expenses.	Administrative	expenses	are	assumed	to	be	
15	basis	points.		An	investment	return	excluding	administrative	expenses	would	have	been	7.65	percent.	
Using	this	lower	discount	rate	has	resulted	in	a	slightly	higher	Total	Pension	Liability	and	Net	Pension	
Liability.		CalPERS	checked	the	materiality	threshold	for	the	difference	in	calculation	and	did	not	find	it	to	
be	a	material	difference.		CalPERS	is	scheduled	to	review	all	actuarial	assumptions	as	part	of	its	regular	
Asset	Liability	Management	(ALM)	review	cycle	that	is	scheduled	to	be	completed	in	February	2018.		Any	
changes	to	the	discount	rate	will	require	Board	action	and	proper	stakeholder	outreach.		For	these	
reasons,	CalPERS	expects	to	continue	using	a	discount	rate	net	of	administrative	expenses	for	GASB	67	
and	68	calculations	through	at	least	the	2017‐18	fiscal	year.		CalPERS	will	continue	to	check	the	
materiality	of	the	difference	in	calculation	until	such	time	as	we	have	changed	our	methodology.

Discount	Rate	–	for	CalPERS	(continued)	
The	long‐term	expected	rate	of	return	on	pension	plan	investments	was	determined	using	a	building‐
block	method	in	which	best‐estimate	ranges	of	expected	future	real	rates	of	return	(expected	returns,	net	
of	pension	plan	investment	expense	and	inflation)	are	developed	for	each	major	asset	class.		The	best‐
estimate	ranges	were	developed	using	capital	market	assumptions	from	CalSTRS	general	investment	
consultant	(Pension	Consulting	Alliance‐PCA)	as	an	input	to	the	process.		Based	on	the	model	from	
CalSTRS	consulting	actuary's	(Milliman)	investment	practice,	a	best	estimate	range	was	determined	by	
assuming	the	portfolio	is	re‐balanced	annually	and	that	annual	returns	are	lognormally	distributed	and	
independent	from	year	to	year	to	develop	expected	percentiles	for	the	long‐term	distribution	of	
annualized	returns.		The	assumed	asset	allocation	by	PCA	is	based	on	board	policy	for	target	asset	
allocation	in	effect	on	February	2,	2012,	the	date	the	current	experience	study	was	approved	by	the	
board.	
	In	determining	the	long‐term	expected	rate	of	return,	CalPERS	took	into	account	both	short‐term	and	
long‐term	market	return	expectations	as	well	as	the	expected	pension	fund	cash	flows.		Using	historical	
returns	of	all	the	funds’	asset	classes,	expected	compound	returns	were	calculated	over	the	short‐term	
(first	10	years)	and	the	long‐term	(11‐60	years)	using	a	building‐block	approach.		Using	the	expected	
nominal	returns	for	both	short‐term	and	long‐term,	the	present	value	of	benefits	was	calculated	for	each	
fund.			
The	expected	rate	of	return	was	set	by	calculating	the	single	equivalent	expected	return	that	arrived	at	
the	same	present	value	of	benefits	for	cash	flows	as	the	one	calculated	using	both	short‐term	and	long‐
term	returns.	The	expected	rate	of	return	was	then	set	equivalent	to	the	single	equivalent	rate	calculated	
above	and	rounded	down	to	the	nearest	one	quarter	of	one	percent.	
	The	table	below	reflects	the	long‐term	expected	real	rate	of	return	by	asset	class.	The	rate	of	return	was	
calculated	using	the	capital	market	assumptions	applied	to	determine	the	discount	rate	and	asset	
allocation.	These	rates	of	return	are	net	of	administrative	expenses.

Special	Arrangements	for	Contract	Employees	

		
Select	retirees	receive	a	lifetime	subsidy	equal	to	the	actual	cost	of	his/her	healthcare	benefits.		As	of	the	
valuation	date,	there	is	one	retiree	receiving	this	subsidy,	with	a	commitment	to	one	additional	employee	at	
retirement.	
	The	District’s	funding	policy	is	based	on	the	projected	pay‐as‐you‐go	financing	requirements,	with	additional	
amounts	to	prefund	benefits	as	determined	annually	by	the	governing	board.		For	fiscal	year	2014‐15,	the	
District	contributed	$189,307.	
The	District’s	annual	OPEB	cost	is	calculated	based	on	the	Annual	Required	Contribution	(ARC),	an	amount	
actuarially	determined	in	accordance	with	the	parameters	of	GASB	Statement	45.		The	ARC	represents	a	level	
of	funding	that,	if	paid	on	an	ongoing	basis,	is	projected	to	cover	normal	cost	each	year	and	amortize	any	
unfunded	actuarial	liabilities	(or	funding	excess)	over	a	period	not	to	exceed	thirty	years.		
	The	table	on	the	next	page	shows	the	components	of	the	District’s	annual	OPEB	cost	for	the	year,	the	amount	
actually	contributed	to	the	plan,	and	changes	in	the	District’s	net	OPEB	obligation:

As	of	July	1,	2014,	the	most	recent	actuarial	valuation	date,	the	District	did	not	have	a	funded	plan.		The	
actuarial	accrued	liability	(AAL)	for	benefits	was	$10.8	million	and	the	unfunded	actuarial	accrued	liability	
(UAAL)	was	$10.8	million.			
	Actuarial	valuations	of	an	ongoing	plan	involve	estimates	of	the	value	of	reported	amounts	and	assumptions	
about	the	probability	of	occurrence	of	events	far	into	the	future.		Examples	include	assumptions	about	future	
employment,	mortality,	and	the	healthcare	cost	trend.		Actuarially	determined	amounts	are	subject	to	
continual	revision	as	actual	results	are	compared	with	past	expectations	and	new	estimates	are	made	about	
the	future.		The	schedules	of	funding	progress	present	multiyear	trend	information	about	whether	the	
actuarial	values	of	plan	assets	are	increasing	or	decreasing	over	time	relative	to	the	actuarial	accrued	
liabilities	for	benefits.

The	District’s	annual	OPEB	cost,	the	percentage	of	annual	OPEB	cost	contributed	to	the	plan,	and	the	net	OPEB

Actuarial	Methods	and	Assumptions	

		
Projections	of	benefits	for	financial	reporting	purposes	are	based	on	the	substantive	plan	(the	plan	as	
understood	by	the	employer	and	plan	members)	and	include	the	types	of	benefits	provided	at	the	time	of	each	
valuation	and	the	historical	pattern	of	sharing	of	benefit	costs	between	the	employer	and	plan	members	to	
that	point.		The	actuarial	methods	and	assumptions	used	include	techniques	that	are	designated	to	reduce	the	
effects	of	short‐term	volatility	in	actuarial	accrued	liabilities	and	the	actuarial	value	of	assets,	consistent	with	
the	long‐term	perspective	of	the	calculations.

Notes	to	the	Required	Supplementary	Information	
For	the	Fiscal	Year	Ended	June	30,	2015	

	
This	schedule	is	required	by	GASB	Statement	No.	34	as	required	supplementary	information	(RSI)	for	the	
General	Fund	and	for	each	major	special	revenue	fund	that	has	a	legally	adopted	annual	budget.		The	
budgetary	comparison	schedule	presents	both	(a)	the	original	and	(b)	the	final	appropriated	budgets	for	the	
reporting	period	as	well	as	(c)	actual	inflows,	outflows,	and	balances,	stated	on	the	District’s	budgetary	basis.		
A	separate	column	to	report	the	variance	between	the	final	budget	and	actual	amounts	is	also	presented,	
although	not	required.	
	
This	schedule	is	required	by	GASB	Statement	No.	45	for	all	sole	and	agent	employers	that	provide	other	
postemployment	benefits	(OPEB).		The	schedule	presents,	for	the	most	recent	actuarial	valuation	and	the	two	
preceding	valuations,	information	about	the	funding	progress	of	the	plan,	including,	for	each	valuation,	the	
actuarial	valuation	date,	the	actuarial	value	of	assets,	the	actuarial	accrued	liability,	the	total	unfunded	
actuarial	liability	(or	funding	excess),	the	actuarial	value	of	assets	as	a	percentage	of	the	actuarial	accrued	
liability	(funded	ratio),	the	annual	covered	payroll,	and	the	ratio	of	the	total	unfunded	actuarial	liability	(or	
funding	excess)	to	annual	covered	payroll.		
	
This	schedule	is	required	by	GASB	Statement	No.	68	and	is	required	for	all	employers	in	a	cost‐sharing	
pension	plan.		The	schedule	reports	the	following	information:	
  The	proportion	(percentage)	of	the	collective	net	pension	liability	(similar	to	the	note	disclosure)	
  The	proportionate	share	(amount)	of	the	collective	net	pension	liability	
  The	employer's	covered‐employee	payroll	
  The	proportionate	share	(amount)	of	the	collective	net	pension	liability	as	a	percentage	of	the	
employer's	covered‐employee	payroll	
  The	pension	plan's	fiduciary	net	position	as	a	percentage	of	the	total	pension	liability	
	
This	schedule	is	required	by	GASB	Statement	No.	68	and	is	required	for	all	employers	in	a	cost‐sharing	
pension	plan.		The	schedule	reports	the	following	information:	
If	an	employer's	contributions	to	the	plan	are	actuarially	determined	or	based	on	statutory	or	
contractual	requirements:	the	employer's	actuarially	determined	contribution	to	the	pension	plan	
(or,	if	applicable,	its	statutorily	or	contractually	required	contribution),	the	employer's	actual	
contributions,	the	difference	between	the	actual	and	actuarially	determined	contributions	(or	
statutorily	or	contractually	required),	and	a	ration	of	the	actual	contributions	divided	by	covered‐
employee	payroll.

BONITA	UNIFIED	SCHOOL	DISTRICT	
Note	to	the	Supplementary	Information	
June	30,	2015	

NOTE	1	–	PURPOSE	OF	SCHEDULES	

Schedule	of	Average	Daily	Attendance	(ADA)	

Schedule	of	Instructional	Time	

		
	
Average	daily	attendance	(ADA)	is	a	measurement	of	the	number	of	pupils	attending	classes	of	the	District.	
The	purpose	of	attendance	accounting	from	a	fiscal	standpoint	is	to	provide	the	basis	on	which	
apportionments	of	State	funds	are	made	to	school	districts.		This	schedule	provides	information	regarding	the	
attendance	of	students	at	various	grade	levels	and	in	different	programs.	
	
The	District	has	participated	in	the	Incentives	for	Longer	Instructional	Day	and	Longer	Instructional	Year.		
The	District	has	not	met	its	target	funding.		This	schedule	presents	information	on	the	amount	of	instructional	
time	offered	by	the	District	and	whether	the	District	complied	with	the	provisions	of	Education	Code	Sections	
46200	through	46206.	
	Districts	must	maintain	their	instructional	minutes	at	the	1986‐87	requirement,	as	reduced	by	Education	
Code	Section	46201.2(a).	
	
This	schedule	discloses	the	District’s	financial	trends	by	displaying	past	years’	data	along	with	current	year	
budget	information.		These	financial	trend	disclosures	are	used	to	evaluate	the	District’s	ability	to	continue	as	
a	going	concern	for	a	reasonable	period	of	time.	
	
This	schedule	provides	the	information	necessary	to	reconcile	the	fund	balance	of	all	funds	reported	on	the	
Unaudited	Actual	financial	report	to	the	audited	financial	statements.	
	
The	schedule	of	expenditures	of	Federal	awards	includes	the	Federal	grant	activity	of	the	District	and	is	
presented	on	the	modified	accrual	basis	of	accounting.		The	information	in	this	schedule	is	presented	in	
accordance	with	the	requirements	of	the	United	States	of	America	Office	of	Management	and	Budget	Circular	
A‐133,	Audits	of	States,	Local	Governments,	and	Non‐Profit	Organizations.		Therefore,	some	amounts	presented	
in	this	schedule	may	differ	from	amounts	presented	in,	or	used	in	the	preparation	of	the	financial	statements.	
	
Of	the	Federal	expenditures	presented	in	the	schedule,	the	District	provided	no	Federal	awards	to	
subrecipients.

Internal	Control	Over	Financial	Reporting	

INDEPENDENT	AUDITORS'	REPORT	ON	INTERNAL	CONTROL	OVER	FINANCIAL		

REPORTING	AND	ON	COMPLIANCE	AND	OTHER	MATTERS	BASED	ON	AN		

AUDIT	OF	FINANCIAL	STATEMENTS	PERFORMED	IN	ACCORDANCE		

WITH	GOVERNMENT	AUDITING	STANDARDS	

		Board	of	Education	
Bonita	Unified	School	District	
San	Dimas,	California	
	
We	have	audited,	in	accordance	with	the	auditing	standards	generally	accepted	in	the	United	States	of	
America	and	the	standards	applicable	to	financial	audits	contained	in	Government	Auditing	Standards	issued	
by	the	Comptroller	General	of	the	United	States,	the	financial	statements	of	the	governmental	activities,	each	
major	fund,	and	the	aggregate	remaining	fund	information	of	Bonita	Unified	School	District	as	of	and	for	the	
year	ended	June	30,	2015,	and	the	related	notes	to	the	financial	statements,	which	collectively	comprise	
Bonita	Unified	School	District's	basic	financial	statements,	and	have	issued	our	report	thereon	dated	October	
20,	2015.			
	
In	planning	and	performing	our	audit	of	the	financial	statements,	we	considered	Bonita	Unified	School	
District’s	internal	control	over	financial	reporting	(internal	control)	to	determine	the	audit	procedures	that	
are	appropriate	in	the	circumstances	for	the	purpose	of	expressing	our	opinions	on	the	financial	statements,	
but	not	for	the	purpose	of	expressing	an	opinion	on	the	effectiveness	of	the	Bonita	Unified	School	District’s	
internal	control.		Accordingly,	we	do	not	express	an	opinion	on	the	effectiveness	of	the	Bonita	Unified	School	
District’s	internal	control.	
	A	deficiency	in	internal	control	exists	when	the	design	or	operation	of	a	control	does	not	allow	management	or	
employees,	in	the	normal	course	of	performing	their	assigned	functions,	to	prevent,	or	detect	and	correct	
misstatements	on	a	timely	basis.		A	 material	 weakness	is	a	deficiency,	or	a	combination	of	deficiencies,	in	
internal	control	such	that	there	is	a	reasonable	possibility	that	a	material	misstatement	of	the	District's	
financial	statements	will	not	be	prevented,	or	detected	and	corrected	on	a	timely	basis.		A	significant	deficiency	
is	a	deficiency,	or	a	combination	of	deficiencies,	in	internal	control	that	is	less	severe	than	a	material	
weakness,	yet	important	enough	to	merit	attention	by	those	charged	with	governance.	
	Our	consideration	of	internal	control	was	for	the	limited	purpose	described	in	the	first	paragraph	of	this	
section	and	was	not	designed	to	identify	all	deficiencies	in	internal	control	that	might	be	material	weaknesses	
or	significant	deficiencies.		Given	these	limitations,	during	our	audit	we	did	not	identify	any	deficiencies	in	
internal	control	that	we	consider	to	be	material	weaknesses.		However,	material	weaknesses	may	exist	that	
have	not	been	identified.

Purpose	of	this	Report	

Compliance	and	Other	Matters	

As	part	of	obtaining	reasonable	assurance	about	whether	Bonita	Unified	School	District’s	financial	statements	
are	free	of	material	misstatement,	we	performed	tests	of	its	compliance	with	certain	provisions	of	laws,	
regulations,	contracts,	and	grant	agreements,	noncompliance	with	which	could	have	a	direct	and	material	
effect	on	the	determination	of	financial	statement	amounts.		However,	providing	an	opinion	on	compliance	
with	those	provisions	was	not	an	objective	of	our	audit,	and	accordingly,	we	do	not	express	such	an	opinion.		
The	results	of	our	tests	disclosed	no	instances	of	noncompliance	or	other	matters	that	are	required	to	be	
reported	under	Government	Auditing	Standards.			
	
The	purpose	of	this	report	is	solely	to	describe	the	scope	of	our	testing	of	internal	control	and	compliance	and	
the	results	of	that	testing,	and	not	to	provide	an	opinion	on	the	effectiveness	of	the	District's	internal	control	
or	on	compliance.		This	report	is	an	integral	part	of	an	audit	performed	in	accordance	with	 Government	
Auditing	 Standards	in	considering	the	District's	internal	control	and	compliance.	
	Accordingly,	this	
communication	is	not	suitable	for	any	other	purpose.

Report	on	State	Compliance	

INDEPENDENT	AUDITORS’	REPORT	ON	STATE	COMPLIANCE	

		Board	of	Education	
Bonita	Unified	School	District	
San	Dimas,	California	
We	have	audited	Bonita	Unified	School	District's	compliance	with	the	types	of	compliance	requirements	
described	in	the	 2014‐15	 Guide	 for	 Annual	 Audits	 of	 K‐12	 Local	 Education	 Agencies	 and	 State	 Compliance	
Reporting	that	could	have	a	direct	and	material	effect	on	each	of	the	Bonita	Unified	School	District's	state	
government	programs	as	noted	on	the	following	page	for	the	fiscal	year	ended	June	30,	2015.			
	
Management	is	responsible	for	compliance	with	the	requirements	of	laws,	regulations,	contracts,	and	grants	
applicable	to	its	State	programs.	
	
Our	responsibility	is	to	express	an	opinion	on	compliance	for	each	of	Bonita	Unified	School	District's	State	
programs	based	on	our	audit	of	the	types	of	compliance	requirements	referred	to	below.		We	conducted	our	
audit	of	compliance	in	accordance	with	auditing	standards	generally	accepted	in	the	United	States	of	America;	
the	standards	applicable	to	financial	audits	contained	in	 Government	 Auditing	 Standards,	issued	by	the	
Comptroller	General	of	the	United	States;	and	 2014‐15	 Guide	 for	 Annual	 Audits	 of	 K‐12	 Local	 Education	
Agencies	 and	 State	 Compliance	 Reporting.		Those	standards	require	that	we	plan	and	perform	the	audit	to	
obtain	reasonable	assurance	about	whether	noncompliance	with	the	types	of	compliance	requirements	
referred	to	below	occurred.	An	audit	includes	examining,	on	a	test	basis,	evidence	about	Bonita	Unified	School	
District’s	compliance	with	those	requirements	and	performing	such	other	procedures	as	we	considered	
necessary	in	the	circumstances.		
	We	believe	that	our	audit	provides	a	reasonable	basis	for	our	opinion	on	compliance	for	each	State	program.		
However,	our	audit	does	not	provide	a	legal	determination	of	Bonita	Unified	School	District’s	compliance.

and	performing	our	audit	of	compliance,	we	considered	Bonita	Unified	School	District’s	internal	control	over	
compliance	with	the	types	of	requirements	that	could	have	a	direct	and	material	effect	on	each	major	federal	
program	to	determine	the	auditing	procedures	that	are	appropriate	in	the	circumstances	for	the	purpose	of	
expressing	an	opinion	on	compliance	for	each	major	federal	program	and	to	test	and	report	on	internal	
control	over	compliance	in	accordance	with	OMB	Circular	A‐133,	but	not	for	the	purpose	of	expressing	an	
opinion	on	the	effectiveness	of	internal	control	over	compliance.		Accordingly,	we	do	not	express	an	opinion	
on	the	effectiveness	of	the	District’s	internal	control	over	compliance.	
	A	 deficiency	 in	 internal	 control	 over	 compliance	exists	when	the	design	or	operation	of	a	control	over	
compliance	does	not	allow	management	or	employees,	in	the	normal	course	of	performing	their	assigned	
functions,	to	prevent,	or	detect	and	correct,	noncompliance	with	a	type	of	compliance	requirement	of	a	federal	
program	on	a	timely	basis.		A	 material	 weakness	 in	 internal	 control	 over	 compliance	is	a	deficiency,	or	a	
combination	of	deficiencies,	in	internal	control	over	compliance,	such	that	there	is	a	reasonable	possibility	
that	material	noncompliance	with	a	type	of	compliance	requirement	of	a	federal	program	will	not	be	
prevented,	or	detected	and	corrected,	on	a	timely	basis.		A	 significant	 deficiency	 in	 internal	 control	 over	
compliance	is	a	deficiency,	or	a	combination	of	deficiencies,	in	internal	control	over	compliance	with	a	type	of	
compliance	requirement	of	a	federal	program	that	is	less	severe	than	a	material	weakness	in	internal	control	
over	compliance,	yet	important	enough	to	merit	attention	by	those	charged	with	governance.	
	Our	consideration	of	internal	control	over	compliance	was	for	the	limited	purpose	described	in	the	first	
paragraph	of	this	section	and	was	not	designed	to	identify	all	deficiencies	in	internal	control	over	compliance	
that	might	be	material	weaknesses	or	significant	deficiencies.		We	did	not	identify	any	deficiencies	in	internal	
control	over	compliance	that	we	consider	to	be	material	weaknesses,	as	defined	above.		However,	material	
weaknesses	may	exist	that	have	not	been	identified.	
	The	purpose	of	this	report	on	internal	control	over	compliance	is	solely	to	describe	the	scope	of	our	testing	of	
internal	control	over	compliance	and	the	results	of	that	testing	based	on	the	requirements	of	OMB	Circular	A‐
133.		Accordingly,	this	report	is	not	suitable	for	any	other	purpose.

BONITA	UNIFIED	SCHOOL	DISTRICT	
Schedule	of	Audit	Findings	and	Questioned	Costs	
For	the	Fiscal	Year	Ended	June	30,	2015	

		
	This	section	identifies	the	audit	findings	pertaining	to	noncompliance	with	state	program	rules	and	
regulations.	
		
Criteria:	Supplemental	and	concentration	grant	amounts	are	calculated	based	on	the	percentage	of	
"unduplicated	pupils"	enrolled	in	the	LEA	on	Census	Day	(first	Wednesday	in	October).	The	percentage	
equals:	
	
  Unduplicated	count	of	pupils	who	(1)	are	English	learners,	(2)	meet	income	or	categorical	eligibility	
requirements	for	free	or	reduced‐price	meals	under	the	National	School	Lunch	Program,	or	(3)	are	
foster	youth.	"Unduplicated	count"	means	that	each	pupil	is	counted	only	once	even	if	the	pupil	meets	
more	than	one	of	these	criteria	(EC	sections	2574(b)(2)	and	42238.02(b)(1)).	
	
  Divided	by	total	enrollment	in	the	LEA	(EC	sections	2574(b)(1)	and	42238.02(b)(5)).		All	pupil	counts	
are	based	on	Fall	1	certified	enrollment	reported	in	the	CALPADS	as	of	Census	Day.	
Condition:	During	our	testing	of	the	free	and	reduced	price	meal	eligible	students	reported	in	the	CALPADS	
1.17	and	1.18	reports,	we	noted	twenty‐two	students	that	were	reported	as	qualifying	for	free	or	reduced	
priced	meals	who	did	not	have	an	application	on	file	for	the	2014‐15	fiscal	year.	This	is	due	to	the	fact	that	the	
District	applied	the	local	“grace	period”	to	the	CALPADS	reporting	and	as	a	result,	many	students	in	the	
CALPADS	system	are	reported	based	on	2013‐14	application	data	instead	of	2014‐15	application	data.	
Additionally,	we	noted	students	that	were	incorrectly	reported	as	qualifying	for	free	or	reduced	priced	meals	
due	to	the	student	information	system	not	being	updated	to	match	the	Child	Nutrition	Services	internal	
system.	
	
Context:	We	noted	errors	in	each	of	the	five	schools	we	tested,	for	a	total	of	22	exceptions.	
	
Questioned	Costs:	$10,081.	This	amount	was	determined	by	calculating	the	difference	between	the	District’s	
original	total	LCFF	revenues	and	the	LCFF	revenues	adjusted	for	the	decrease	in	the	unduplicated	pupil	
counts.	
Effect:	The	unduplicated	pupil	counts	reported	in	the	CALPADS	1.17	and	1.18	reports	should	be	adjusted	for	
the	following	changes	as	a	result	of	the	procedures	performed:

BONITA	UNIFIED	SCHOOL	DISTRICT	
Schedule	of	Audit	Findings	and	Questioned	Costs	
For	the	Fiscal	Year	Ended	June	30,	2015	

		
		
	
Recommendation:	We	recommend	that	the	District	work	with	the	Child	Nutrition	Services	department	to	
update	the	CALPADS	system	once	all	applications	are	received.	Although	there	is	a	grace	period	recognized	at	
a	local	level,	the	District	should	update	CALPADS	retroactively	to	reflect	the	current	year	application	
information	in	the	reporting	software.	We	also	recommend	that	procedures	are	established	to	ensure	that	the	
student	information	system	which	is	used	for	CALPADS	reporting,	is	updated	to	reflect	the	changes	made	in	
the	Child	Nutrition	Services	internal	system	prior	to	the	submission	of	the	CALPADS	report.	
	
District	 Response:		The	food	services	and	computer	information	system	departments	found	what	was	
causing	the	errors	in	the	pupil	counts.	They	are	now	in	sync	with	having	the	same	numbers	that	will	be	
reported	in	CALPADS.

Observation:	

ASSOCIATED	STUDENT	BODY	(ASB)	FUNDS	

			To	the	Board	of	Education	
Bonita	Unified	School	District	
San	Dimas,	California	
		In	planning	and	performing	our	audit	of	the	basic	financial	statements	of	Bonita	Unified	School	District	for	the	
year	ending	June	30,	2015,	we	considered	its	internal	control	structure	in	order	to	determine	our	auditing	
procedures	for	the	purpose	of	expressing	our	opinion	on	the	basic	financial	statements	and	not	to	provide	
assurance	on	the	internal	control	structure.	
	However,	during	our	audit	we	noted	matters	that	are	an	opportunity	for	strengthening	internal	controls	and	
operating	efficiency.		The	following	items	represent	conditions	noted	by	our	audit	that	we	consider	important	
enough	to	bring	to	your	attention.		This	letter	does	not	affect	our	report	dated	October	20,	2015,	on	the	financial	
statements	of	Bonita	Unified	School	District.			
		
	
Observation:	 	During	our	cash	receipts	testing	at	San	Dimas	High	we	found	that	two	of	ten	deposits	tested	
lacked	sufficient	supporting	documentation	such	as:	tally	sheets,	ticket	sales	logs,	cash	receipts,	and/or	point	of	
sale	documentations	should	have	been	maintained	for	the	transactions.	Without	these	documents,	we	could	not	
verify	whether	all	cash	collected	had	been	deposited	intact	and	into	the	correct	ASB	account.			
	
Recommendation:		Sound	internal	controls	for	handling	cash	discourage	theft	of	ASB	funds	and	protect	those	
who	handle	the	cash.		It	is	important	to	tie	all	proceeds	to	the	specific	fundraiser	from	which	they	were	
generated	and	to	ensure	that	all	proceeds	from	an	event	are	turned	in	and	properly	accounted	for.		We	
recommend	that	before	any	events	are	held,	control	procedures	should	be	established	that	will	allow	for	the	
reconciliation	between	money	collected	and	fundraiser	sales.	
		
	During	our	testing	of	cash	disbursements	at	 Lone	 Hill	 Middle,	our	sample	included	
disbursements	that	appear	to	be	missing	support	proof	of	receipt	of	goods	or	okay	to	pay.		Issuing	payment	for	
purchases	without	proper	supporting	documentation	can	provide	the	opportunity	for	the	misappropriation	of	
student	funds.		
	
Recommendation:		We	recommend	that	the	site	require	all	appropriate	supporting	documentation	prior	to	
issuing	disbursements	to	ensure	that	student	funds	are	being	properly	spent.	
		
Observation:		Through	inquiry	and	testing	of	cash	disbursements	at	Lone	Hill	Middle	and	San	Dimas	High	we	
noted	that	the	sites	are	purchasing	Lowe's	gift	cards	and	issuing	cash	awards.		ASB	funds	are	considered	public	
funds	because	they	are	raised	through	the	District’s	tax	identification	number	and	receive	the	benefit	of	
nontaxable	status.		Anything	that	is	purchased	must	be	for	goods	and	services	that	promote	the	students’	
general	welfare,	morale,	and	educational	experiences.	
	
Recommendation:		We	recommend	that	the	site	discontinue	issuing	such	payments	from	ASB	and	that	the	site	
be	reminded	of	allowable	and	prohibited	purchases	with	ASB	funds.

We	will	review	the	status	of	the	current	year	comments	during	our	next	audit	engagement.

(a) 

If the amendment or waiver relates to the provisions of Sections 3(a), 4, 5(a) or

in legal requirements, change in law, or change in the identity, nature or status of an obligated 
person with respect to the Bonds, or the type of business conducted; 

(b) 

The undertaking, as amended or taking into account such waiver, would, in the

interpretations of the Rule, as well as any change in circumstances; 

(c) 

The amendment or waiver does not, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond

(d) 

No  duties  of  the  Dissemination  Agent  hereunder  shall  be  amended  without  its 

written consent thereto. 

In the event of any amendment or waiver of a provision of this Disclosure Certificate, the District shall 
describe  such  amendment  in  the  next  Annual  Report,  and  shall  include,  as  applicable,  a  narrative 
explanation of the reason for the amendment or waiver and its impact on the type (or in the case of a 
change  of  accounting  principles,  on  the  presentation)  of  financial  information  or  operating  data  being 
presented by the District. In addition, if the amendment relates to the accounting principles to be followed 
in preparing financial statements, (i) notice of such change shall be given in the same manner as for a 
Listed Event under Section 5(b), and (ii) the Annual Report for the year in which the change is made 
should present a comparison (in narrative form and also, if feasible, in quantitative form) between the 
financial statements as prepared on the basis of the new accounting principles and those prepared on the 
basis of the former accounting principles. 

SECTION 9.  Additional Information.  Nothing in this Disclosure Certificate shall be deemed to 
prevent the District from disseminating any other information, using the means of dissemination set forth 
in this Disclosure Certificate or any other means of communication, or including any other information in 
any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event, in addition to that which is required by this 
Disclosure Certificate. If the District chooses to include any information in any Annual Report or notice 
of  occurrence  of  a  Listed  Event  in  addition  to  that  which  is  specifically  required  by  this  Disclosure 
Certificate,  the  District  shall  have  no  obligation  under  this  Certificate  to  update  such  information  or 
include it in any future Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event. 

 

C-5 

 

SECTION 10.  Default.  In the event of a failure of the District to comply with any provision of 
this Disclosure Certificate any Holder or Beneficial Owner of the Bonds may take such actions as may be 
necessary and appropriate, including seeking mandate or specific performance by court order, to cause the 
District to comply with its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate. A default under this Disclosure 
Certificate shall not be deemed an event of default under the Resolution, and the sole remedy under this 
Disclosure Certificate in the event of any failure of the District to comply with this Disclosure Certificate 
shall be an action to compel performance.

Beneficial  Owners.    The  District  agrees  to  indemnify  and  save  the  Dissemination  Agent,  its  officers, 
directors,  employees  and  agents,  harmless  against  any  loss,  expense  and  liabilities  which  it  may  incur 
arising out of or in the exercise or performance of its powers and duties hereunder, including the costs and 
expenses (including attorney’s fees) of defending against any claim of liability, but excluding liabilities 
due to the Dissemination Agent’s negligence or willful misconduct.  The obligations of the District under 
this Section shall survive resignation or removal of the Dissemination Agent and payment of the Bonds.  
The  Dissemination  Agent  shall  have  no  liability  for  the  failure  to  report  any  event  or  any  financial 
information as to which the District has not provided an information report in format suitable for filing 
with the Repository.  The Dissemination Agent shall not be required to monitor or enforce the District’s 
duty to comply with its continuing disclosure requirements hereunder.

APPENDIX D 

CITIES OF LA VERNE AND SAN DIMAS AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY 

GENERAL AND ECONOMIC DATA 

The following information concerning the Cities of La Verne and San Dimas and Los Angeles 

County is included only for the purpose of supplying general information regarding the community. 

City of La Verne 

The City of La Verne (“La Verne”) is located in the foothills of the San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys, 
about 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.  La Verne was founded in 1887 and incorporated in 1906.  
La Verne has a council-manager form of government and is governed by four city council members and a 
mayor  who  are  elected  at  large.    The  La  Verne  City  Manager  is  appointed  by  the  city  council  and  is 
responsible for the day-to-day business of La Verne. 

City of San Dimas 

The City of San Dimas (“San Dimas,” and together with La Verne, the “Cities”) is located in the 
foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, about 28 miles east/northeast of downtown Los Angeles.  Several 
freeways run through San Dimas connecting it with the Los Angeles and San Bernardino County areas, 
including  U.S. Route  66,  which  runs  southward,  the  Arrow  Highway,  which  runs  east-west  and  San 
Dimas Avenue, which runs north-south.  The Foothill Freeway (I-210) connects San Dimas to Pasadena 
and the San Fernando Valley, and the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) connects San Dimas to downtown 
Los Angeles to the west and San Bernardino to the east. 

San Dimas was incorporated in 1960 and has a council-manager form of government.  The city 
council is composed of a mayor and four city council members elected at large.  Members of the city 
council  serve  four-year  terms  and  the  mayor  serves  a  two-year  term.    The  city  council  acts  as  the 
legislative body for the establishment of laws, policies and programs. 

Los Angeles County 

Los Angeles County (the “County”), which is located along the southern coast of California (the 
“State”)  encompasses  an  area  of  4,080  miles.    Approximately  half  of  the  County  is  mountainous  and 
14 percent is a coastal plain known as the Los Angeles Basin. 

The 88 cities within the County encompass about 35% of the County, while more than 65% of the 
County remains unincorporated.  The County has the largest population of any county in the nation with 
more  than  10.1  million  inhabitants  as  of  2015.    The  County  is  bordered  on  the  east  and  the  south  by 
Orange and San Bernardino Counties, on the north by Kern County, and on the west by Ventura County 
and the Pacific Ocean.

APPENDIX E 

LOS ANGELES COUNTY TREASURY POOL 

The  following  information  concerning  the  Los  Angeles  County  Treasury  Pool  (the  “Treasury 
Pool”) has been provided by the Treasurer and Tax Collector (the “Treasurer”) of Los Angeles County 
(the  “County”),  and  has  not  been  confirmed  or  verified  by  the  District,  the  Financial  Advisor  or  the 
Underwriter.  The District, the Financial Advisor and the Underwriter have  not made an independent 
investigation of the investments in the Treasury Pool and have made no assessment of the current County 
investment policy.  The value of the various investments in the Treasury Pool will fluctuate on a daily 
basis  as  a  result  of  a  multitude  of  factors,  including  generally  prevailing  interest  rates  and  other 
economic conditions.  Additionally, the Treasurer, with the consent of the County Board of Supervisors 
may change the County investment policy at any time.  Therefore, there  can be no assurance that the 
values  of  the  various  investments  in  the  Treasury  Pool  will  not  vary  significantly  from  the  values 
described  herein.    Finally,  none  of  the  District,  the  Financial  Advisor  or  the  Underwriter  make  any 
representation  as  to  the  accuracy  or  adequacy  of  such  information  or  as  to  the  absence  of  material 
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof, or that the information contained or 
incorporated hereby by reference is correct as of any time subsequent to its date.  Additional information 
regarding the Treasury Pool may be obtained from the Treasurer at www.ttc.lacounty.gov; however, the 
information presented on such website is not incorporated herein by any reference.

THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY POOLED SURPLUS INVESTMENTS 


The  Treasurer  and  Tax  Collector  (the  Treasurer)  of  Los  Angeles  County  has  the 
delegated  authority  to  invest  funds  on  deposit  in  the  County Treasury  (the  Treasury 
Pool). As of December 31,  2015,  investments in  the Treasury Pool  were  held for local 
agencies  including  school  districts,  community  college  districts,  special  districts  and 
discretionary  depositors  such  as  cities  and  independent  districts  in  the  following 
amounts: 

Local Agency

Discretionary Participants 
Total 

Invested Funds 

(in billions) 

$13.809

$27.383 

The Treasury Pool participation composition is as follows: 

Non-discretionary Participants 
Discretionary Participants: 


Independent Public Agencies 
County Bond Proceeds and Repayment Funds 

Total 

92.20% 


6.72% 

1.08% 

100.00% 

Decisions  on  the  investment of funds  in  the  Treasury  Pool  are  made  by the  County 
Investment  Officer  in  accordance  with  established  policy,  with  certain  transactions 
requiring  the Treasurer's  prior approval.  In  Los Angeles County,  investment decisions 
are governed by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 53600) of Part 1 of Division 2 of 
Title  5  of the  California  Government  Code, which  governs  legal  investments  by local 
agencies  in  the  State  of  California,  and  by  a  more  restrictive  Investment  Policy 
developed  by  the  Treasurer  and  adopted  by  the  Los Angeles  County  Board  of 
Supervisors  on  an  annual  basis.  The  Investment Policy adopted  on  March  31,  2015, 
reaffirmed the following criteria and order of priority for selecting investments: 

1. 
2. 
3. 

Safety of Principal 
Liquidity 
Return on Investment 

The  Treasurer  prepares  a  monthly  Report  of  Investments  (the  Investment  Report) 
summarizing  the  status of the Treasury  Pool, including the  current market value  of all 
investments.  This report is submitted monthly to the Board of Supervisors.  According to 

the Investment  Report dated  February 1,  2016,  the  December 31,  2015  book value of 
the  Treasury  Pool  was  approximately  $27 .383  billion  and  the  corresponding  market 
value was approximately $27.318 billion. 

An  internal controls system for monitoring cash  accounting and  investment practices  is 
in  place.  The  Treasurer's  Compliance  Auditor,  who  operates  independently from  the 
Investment  Officer,  reconciles  cash  and  investments  to  fund  balances  daily.  The 
Compliance  Auditor's  staff  also  reviews  each  investment  trade  for  accuracy  and 
compliance  with  the  Board  adopted  Investment  Policy.  On  a  quarterly  basis,  the 
County's  outside  independent  auditor  (External  Auditor)  reviews  the  cash  and 
investment  reconciliations  for  completeness  and  accuracy.  Additionally,  the  External 
Auditor reviews  investment transactions  on  a quarterly basis for conformance with  the 
approved Investment Policy and annually accounts for all investments. 

The  following  table  identifies  the  types  of securities  held  by the  Treasury Pool  as  of 
December 31, 2015:

the investments mature within 60 days, with an average of 513 days to  maturity for the 
entire portfolio.
