In the opinion of Quint & Thimmig LLP, Larkspur, California, Bond Counsel, subject to compliance by the District with certain covenants, under present law, 
interest on Bonds is excludable from gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes and is not included as an item of tax preference in com-
puting the federal alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations, but such interest is taken into account in computing an adjustment used in deter-
mining the federal alternative minimum tax for certain corporations. In addition, in the opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is exempt from personal 
income taxation imposed by the State of California. See “TAX MATTERS” herein.

The  $28,000,000  Sunnyvale  School  District  (Santa  Clara  County,  California)  General  Obligation  Bonds,  Election  of  2013,  Series  A  (2014)  (the  “Series  A

issued to (a) finance the acquisition and construction of educational facilities and projects which were described in the ballot measure approved by the electors

District Bonds secure and provide the source of payment for the 2005 Authority Bonds. By virtue of the refunding of the Refunded 2005 Authority Bonds, the 
2005 District Bonds maturing on and after September 1, 2015, will also be refunded.

District (except certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates), all as more fully described herein under “THE BONDS” and “AD VALOREM 
PROPERTY TAXATION.” 
 
The Bonds are issuable in denominations of $5,000 and any integral multiple thereof. Interest on the Bonds is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year,

tion, as paying agent, to DTC or its nominee, which will in turn remit such payment to its participants for subsequent disbursement to the beneficial owners of 
the Bonds. See “BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM” herein.

guide  to,  and  is  qualified  by,  more  complete  and  detailed  information  contained  in  the  entire  Official 
Statement,  including  the  cover  page,  the  inside  cover  page  and  appendices  hereto,  and  the  documents

The District 

 
The Sunnyvale School District (the “District”) was established as an elementary school district 
in  1904  and  is  located  at  819  West  Iowa  Avenue  in  Sunnyvale,  California.  The  District  operates  eight 
elementary schools (K-5) and two middle schools (6-8). The District is governed by a five-member board 
of education (the “Board”), each member of which is elected to a four-year term. Elections for positions 
to  the  Board  are  held  every  two  years,  alternating  between  two  and  three  available  positions.  The 
management  and  policies  of  the  District  are  administered  by  a  Superintendent  appointed  by  the  Board 
who  is  responsible  for  day-to-day  District  operations  as  well  as  the  supervision  of  the  District’s  other 
personnel. Benjamin H. Picard, Ed.D. is the District Superintendent. The District operates as a “basic 
aid” district. 

 
For more complete information concerning the District, including certain financial information, 
see  “THE  DISTRICT”  and  “APPENDIX  B—DISTRICT  AND  GENERAL  SCHOOL  DISTRICT 
FINANCIAL  INFORMATION.”  The  District’s  audited  financial  statements  for  the  fiscal  year  ended 
June  30,  2013,  are  included  as  APPENDIX  C—AUDITED  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  OF  THE 
DISTRICT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013.  

 

Sources of Payment for the Bonds 

 
The Bonds represent general obligations of the District payable solely from ad valorem property 
taxes levied and collected by the County. The Board of Supervisors of the County is empowered and is 
obligated to annually levy ad valorem taxes for the payment of the Bonds and the interest thereon upon all 
property  in  the  District  subject  to  taxation  by  the  District  without  limitation  of  rate  or  amount  (except 

 

certain  personal  property  which  is  taxable  at  limited  rates).  See  “SECURITY  AND  SOURCE  OF 
PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS.” 

 

Authority for Issue; Purpose of Issue 
 

Series A Bonds. The Series A Bonds are issued pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the State 
of California (the “State”), including the provisions of Article 4.5 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of 
Title 5 (commencing with section 53506) of the California Government Code (the “New Money Bond 
Law”).  The  Series  A  Bonds  are  authorized  to  be  issued  pursuant  to  a  resolution  (the  “Series  A  Bond 
Resolution”), adopted by the Board of Education of the District (the “District Board”) on June 19, 2014. 

 
The Series A Bonds are being issued to (a) finance the acquisition and construction of educational 
facilities and projects which were described in the ballot measure approved by the electors of the District 
on  November  5,  2013,  which  authorized  the  issuance  of  general  obligation  bonds  in  the  maximum 
aggregate principal amount of $96,000,000 (the “2013 Authorization”), and (b) pay for costs of issuance 
of the Bonds. The Series A Bonds are the first issue under the 2013 Authorization. 

 
Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds are issued pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the 
State, including the provisions of Article 9 of Chapter 3 (commencing with section 53550) of Division 2 of 
Title 5 of the California Government Code (the “Refunding Bond Law”). The Bonds are authorized to be 
issued pursuant to a resolution (the “Refunding Bond Resolution”), adopted by the Board on June 19, 
2014. 

 
The  Refunding  Bonds  are  being  issued  to  (a)  refund  the  outstanding  Alameda-Contra  Costa 
Schools  Financing  Authority  Revenue  Bonds,  2005  Series  B  (Sunnyvale  School  District  Refunding 
Program) (the “2005 Authority Bonds”), maturing on and after September 1, 2015 (the “Refunded 2005 
Authority Bonds”), and (b) pay for costs of issuance of the Refunding Bonds. The proceeds of the 2005 
Authority Bonds were used to purchase the Sunnyvale School District (County of Santa Clara, California) 
2005 General Obligation Refunding Bonds (the “2005 District Bonds”), and to provide additional funds 
for the District which were used for authorized school purposes. The proceeds of the 2005 District Bonds 
were used to refund certain outstanding general obligation bonds of the District. 
 
Description of the Bonds 

 
The Bonds are being issued as current interest bonds. The Bonds will be dated as of their date of 
delivery, will be issued as fully registered bonds, without coupons, in the denominations of $5,000 or any 
integral  multiple  thereof.  Interest  on  the  Bonds  accrues  from  their  date  of  delivery  and  is  payable 
semiannually on each March 1 and September 1 (each an “Interest Payment Date”), commencing March 
1, 2015. 

 
The Bonds will be issued in fully registered form only, registered in the name of Cede & Co. as 
nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”), and will be available to 
actual purchasers of the Bonds (the “Beneficial Owners”) in the denominations set forth on the inside 
cover page hereof, under the book-entry system maintained by DTC, only through brokers and dealers 
who are or act through DTC Participants as described herein. Beneficial Owners will not be entitled to 
receive  physical  delivery  of  the  Bonds.  See  “BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY  SYSTEM”  and  APPENDIX  G—
BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM. In event that the book-entry-only system described below is no longer used 
with  respect  to  the  Bonds,  the  Bonds  will  be  registered  in  accordance  with  the  Resolutions  described

herein.  See  “THE  BONDS—Registration,  Transfer  and  Exchange  of  Bonds.”  Individual  purchases  of 
interests  in  the  Bonds  will  be  available  to  purchasers  of  the  Bonds  in  the  denominations  of  $5,000 
principal amount or any integral multiple thereof. 

 
Certain  of  the  Bonds  are  subject  to  redemption  prior  to  maturity.  See  “THE  BONDS—

Redemption.” 
 
Tax Matters 

 
In the opinion of Quint & Thimmig LLP, Larkspur, California, Bond Counsel (“Bond Counsel”), 
subject to compliance by the District with certain covenants, under present law, interest on the Bonds is 
excludable from gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes and is not included as 
an  item  of  tax  preference  in  computing  the  federal  alternative  minimum  tax  for  individuals  and 
corporations, but such interest is taken into account in computing an adjustment used in determining the 
federal alternative minimum tax for certain corporations. See “TAX MATTERS.” 

 

Offering and Delivery 

 
The Bonds are offered when, as and if issued and received by the purchaser thereof, subject to 
approval as to their legality by Bond Counsel. It is anticipated that the Bonds will be available for delivery 
through the facilities of DTC on or about August 12, 2014.

The District will covenant for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds to make available certain 
financial information and operating data relating to the District and to provide notices of the occurrence of 
certain  enumerated  events  in  compliance  with  S.E.C.  Rule  15c2-12(b)(5).  The  specific  nature  of  the

Authority for Issuance 

THE BONDS 

 
Series A Bonds. The Series A Bonds are issued pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the State, 
including the provisions of the New Money Bond Law. The Series A Bonds are authorized pursuant to the 
Series A Bond Resolution. 

 
Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds are issued pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the 
State, including the provisions of the Refunding Bond Law. The Refunding Bonds are authorized pursuant 
to the Refunding Bond Resolution. 

 

Purpose of Issuance 

 
Series  A  Bonds.  The  Bonds  are  being  issued  to  (a)  finance  the  acquisition  and  construction  of 
educational facilities and projects which were described in the 2013 Authorization, and (b) pay for costs of 
issuance of the Series A Bonds. See “—Sources and Uses of Funds.” 
 

Refunding  Bonds.  The  Refunding  Bonds  are  being  issued  to  (a)  refund  the  Refunded  2005 
Authority  Bonds,  and  (b)  pay  for  costs  of  issuance  of  the  Series  A  Bonds.  The  proceeds  of  the  2005 
Authority Bonds were used to purchase the 2005 District Bonds, and to provide additional funds for the 
District which were used for authorized school purposes. The proceeds of the 2005 District Bonds were 
used  to  refund  certain  outstanding  general  obligation  bonds  of  the  District.  The  debt  service  payments 
made by the District with respect to the 2005 District Bonds secure and provide the source of payment for 
the 2005 Authority Bonds. By virtue of the refunding of the Refunded 2005 Authority Bonds, the 2005 
District Bonds maturing on and after September 1, 2015, will also be refunded. See “—Sources and Uses 
of Funds” and “—Refunding Plan.” 
 

The District has authorized and issued certain other general obligation bonds. See APPENDIX 
B—DISTRICT AND GENERAL SCHOOL DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION—District Debt 
Structure. 

 
Security 
 

The Bonds represent general obligations of the District payable solely from ad valorem property 
taxes  levied  and  collected  with  respect  to  the  Bonds.  The  Board  of  Supervisors  of  the  County  is 
empowered  and  is  obligated  to  levy  ad  valorem  taxes  for  the  payment  of  the  Bonds,  and  the  interest 
thereon, upon all property in the District subject to taxation by the District without limitation of rate or 
amount (except certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates). Such taxes are required to be 
levied  annually,  in  addition  to  all  other  taxes,  during  the  period  that  the  Bonds  are  outstanding  in  an 
amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due. Such taxes, when collected, 
will be deposited, with respect to the Bonds, into the Interest and Sinking Fund and which is required by 
the  California  Education  Code  to  be  applied  for  the  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds 

 

-4- 

 

when due. Although the County is obligated to levy an ad valorem tax for the payment of the Bonds, and 
the County Director of Finance will maintain the Interest and Sinking Fund, the Bonds are a debt of the 
District, not the County. 

 
The moneys in the Interest and Sinking Fund, to the extent necessary to pay the principal of and 
interest on the Bonds as the same become due and payable, will be transferred by County, through the 
County  Director  of  Finance,  to  the  Paying  Agent  (hereinafter  defined)  which,  in  turn,  will  pay  such 
moneys to DTC to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds. DTC will thereupon make payments of 
principal  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  to  the  DTC  Participants  who  will  thereupon  make  payments  of 
principal and interest to the Beneficial Owners (as defined herein) of the Bonds. 

 
The  amount  of  the  annual  ad  valorem  tax  levied  by  the  County  to  repay  the  Bonds  will  be 
determined by the relationship between the assessed valuation of taxable property in the District and the 
amount of debt service due on the Bonds in any year. Fluctuations in the annual debt service on the Bonds 
and  the  assessed  value  of  taxable  property  in  the  District  may  cause  the  annual  tax  rate  to  fluctuate. 
Economic and other factors beyond the District’s control, such as a general market decline in land values, 
reclassification  of  property  to  a  class  exempt  from  taxation,  whether  by  ownership  or  use  (such  as 
exemption for property owned by the State and local agencies and property used for qualified educational, 
hospital,  charitable  or  religious  purposes),  or  the  complete  or  partial  destruction  of  taxable  property 
caused by natural or manmade disaster, such as earthquake, flood, or toxic contamination, could cause a 
reduction  in  the  assessed  value  of  taxable  property  within  the  District  and  necessitate  a  corresponding 
increase  in  the  annual  tax  rate.  For  further  information  regarding  the  District’s  assessed  valuation,  tax 
rates, overlapping debt, and other matters concerning taxation, see “TAX BASE FOR REPAYMENT OF 
BONDS.” 

 

Description of the Bonds 

 
The Bonds will be issued in book-entry form only, and will be initially issued and registered in the 
name of Cede & Co. as nominee for DTC. Purchasers will not receive physical certificates representing 
their interest in the Bonds. See “Book-Entry Only System” and APPENDIX G—BOOK-ENTRY ONLY 
SYSTEM. 

 
Interest with respect to the Bonds accrues from their date of delivery and is payable semiannually 
on  March  1  and  September  1  of  each  year  (each,  an  “Interest  Payment  Date”),  commencing  March  1, 
2015. Interest on the Bonds accrues on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. 
Each Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of authentication 
thereof  unless  it  is  authenticated  as  of  a  day  during  the  period  from  the  16th  day  of  the  month  next 
preceding any Interest Payment Date to that Interest Payment Date, inclusive, in which event it will bear 
interest from such Interest Payment Date, or unless it is authenticated on or before February 15, 2015, in 
which event it will bear interest from their date of delivery. The Bonds are issuable in denominations of 
$5,000 principal amount or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds mature on the dates, in the years and 
amounts  set  forth  on  the  inside  cover  page  hereof.  The  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  will  be 
payable by check or draft mailed by first-class mail, in lawful money of the United State of America upon 
presentation and surrender of such Bond at the office of the Paying Agent; provided however, that payment 
of interest may be by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account in the United States of 
America to any owner of Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or more. See also “Book 
Entry Only System” below.

See  the  maturity  schedules  on  the

SCHEDULES—Bonds.” 

 
Payment 
 
The redemption price, if any, on the Bonds will be payable upon maturity or redemption upon 
surrender  of  such  Bonds  at  the  principal  office  of  the  Paying  Agent.  The  interest,  principal  and 
redemption price, if any, on the Bonds will be payable in lawful money of the United States of America. 
The Paying Agent is authorized to pay the Bonds when duly presented for payment at maturity, and to 
cancel  all  Bonds  upon  payment  thereof.  The  Bonds  are  general  obligations  of  the  District  and  do  not 
constitute  obligations  of  the  County.  No  part  of  any  fund  of  the  County  is  pledged  or  obligated  to  the 
payment of the Bonds.

Refunding Bonds. 
 

No Optional Redemption. The Refunding Bonds are non-callable.  
 

Selection  of  Bonds  for  Redemption.  If  less  than  all  of  the  Bonds  are  called  for  redemption,  the 
particular Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed shall be called in such order as shall be directed by the 
District and, in lieu of such direction, in inverse order of their maturity. Within a maturity, the Paying 
Agent shall select the Bonds for redemption by lot; provided, however, that the portion of any Bonds to be 
redeemed  shall  be  in  the  principal  amount  of  $5,000  or  some  integral  multiple  thereof  and  that,  in 
selecting Bonds for redemption, the Paying Agent shall treat each Bonds as representing that number of 
Bonds which is obtained by dividing the principal amount of such Bonds by five thousand dollars. 

 
Notice of Redemption. The Paying Agent is required to give notice of the redemption of the Bonds 
at the expense of the District. Such notice shall specify: (a) that the Bonds or a designated portion thereof 
are to be redeemed, (b) the numbers and CUSIP numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed, (c) the date of 
notice and the date of redemption, (d) the place or places where the redemption will be made, and (e) 
descriptive  information  regarding  the  Bonds  including  the  dated  date,  interest  rate  and  stated  maturity 
date. Such notice shall further state that on the specified date there shall become due and payable upon 
each Bonds to be redeemed, the portion of the principal amount of such Bonds to be redeemed, together 
with interest accrued to said date, and that from and after such date interest with respect thereto shall 
cease to accrue and be payable. 

 
Notice of redemption shall be by registered or otherwise secured mail or delivery service, postage 
prepaid, to the registered owner of the Bonds, or if the registered owner is a syndicate, to the managing 
member of such syndicate, to a municipal registered securities depository and to a national information 
service  that  disseminates  securities  redemption  notices,  and  by  first  class  mail,  postage  prepaid,  to  the 
District and the respective owners of any registered Bonds designated for redemption at their addresses 
appearing on the bond register, in every case at least thirty (30) days, but not more than sixty (60) days, 
prior to the redemption date; provided that neither failure to receive such notice nor any defect in any 
notice so mailed shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the redemption of such Bonds. 

 
Conditional  Notice  of  Redemption.  Any  notice  of  optional  redemption  of  the  Bonds  may  be 
conditional and if any condition stated in the notice of redemption shall not have been satisfied on or prior 
to the redemption date, (i) said notice shall be of no force and effect, (ii) the District shall not be required 
to  redeem  such  Bonds;  (iii)  the  redemption  shall  be  cancelled  and  (iv)  the  Paying  Agent  shall  within  a 
reasonable time thereafter give notice to the persons and in the manner in which the conditional notice of 
redemption  was  given,  that  such  condition  or  conditions  were  not  met  and  that  the  redemption  was 
cancelled.  The  actual  receipt  by  the  owner  of  any  Bonds  of  notice  of  such  cancellation  shall  not  be  a 

 

-7- 

 

condition precedent to cancellation, and failure to receive such notice or any defect in such notice shall 
not affect the validity of the cancellation. 

 
Rescission of Notice of Redemption. The District may rescind any optional redemption and notice 
thereof for any reason on any date on or prior to the date fixed for redemption by causing written notice of 
the rescission to be given to the owners of the Bonds so called for redemption. Any optional redemption 
and  notice  thereof  will  be  rescinded  if  for  any  reason  on  the  date  fixed  for  redemption  moneys  are  not 
available  in  the  Interest  and  Sinking  Fund  or  otherwise  held  in  trust  for  such  purpose  in  an  amount 
sufficient to pay in full on said date the principal of, interest, and any premium due on the Bonds called for 
redemption. Notice of rescission of redemption will be given in the same manner in which the notice of 
redemption was originally given. The actual receipt by the owner of any Bonds of notice of such rescission 
will not be a condition precedent to rescission, and failure to receive such notice or any defect in such 
notice will not affect the validity of the rescission. 

 
Partial Redemption of Bonds. Upon the surrender of any Bonds redeemed in part only (other than 
Bonds  redeemed  from  sinking  fund  payments),  the  Paying  Agent  shall  execute  and  deliver  to  the 
registered  owner  thereof  a  new  Bonds  or  Bonds  of  like  tenor  and  maturity  and  of  authorized 
denominations equal in aggregate principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Bonds surrendered. 
Such partial redemption shall be valid upon payment of the amount required to be paid to such registered 
owner, the Paying Agent and the District shall be released and discharged thereupon from all liability to 
the extent of such payment. 

 
Effect  of  Redemption.  Notice  having  been  given  as  described  above,  and  the  moneys  for  the 
redemption (including the interest to the applicable date of redemption) having been set aside for such 
purpose, the Bonds to be redeemed shall become due and payable on such date of redemption. If on such 
redemption  date,  money  for  the  redemption  of  all  the  Bonds  to  be  redeemed,  together  with  interest  to 
such redemption date, shall be held by the Paying Agent so as to be available therefor on such redemption 
date,  and  if  notice  of  redemption  thereof  shall  have  been  given  as  aforesaid,  then  from  and  after  such 
redemption  date,  interest  with  respect  to  the  Bonds  to  be  redeemed  shall  cease  to  accrue  and  become 
payable. All money held by or on behalf of the Paying Agent for the redemption of Bonds shall be held in 
trust for the account of the registered owners of the Bonds so to be redeemed. Bonds (or portions thereof), 
which  have  been  duly  called  for  redemption  prior  to  maturity,  or  with  respect  to  which  irrevocable 
instructions to call for redemption prior to maturity at the earliest redemption date have been given to the 
Paying Agent, and sufficient moneys are held by the Paying Agent irrevocably in trust for the payment of 
the  redemption  price  of  such  Bonds  or  portions  thereof,  then  such  Bonds  shall  no  longer  be  deemed 
outstanding and shall be surrendered to the Paying Agent for cancellation. 

 

Defeasance 

 
The Bonds may be defeased prior to maturity in the following ways: 
 

(a) Cash. By irrevocably depositing with a bank or trust company, in escrow, an amount of 
cash which, together with amounts then on deposit in the Interest and Sinking Fund, is sufficient 
to pay all Bonds outstanding, including all principal and interest and premium, if any; or 

 
(b)  Defeasance  Securities.  By  irrevocably  depositing  with  a  bank  or  trust  company,  in 
escrow, non-callable Defeasance Securities (as defined below), as permitted under section 149(d) 
of  the  Code,  together  with  cash,  if  required,  in  such  amount  as  will,  in  the  opinion  of  an 

 

-8- 

 

independent  certified  public  accountant,  together  with  interest  to  accrue  thereon  and  moneys 
then on deposit in the Interest and Sinking Fund together with the interest to accrue thereon, be 
fully  sufficient  to  pay  and  discharge  all  Bonds  (including  all  principal  and  interest  represented 
thereby and redemption premiums, if any), at or before their maturity date;  
 

then, notwithstanding that any of the Bonds will not have been surrendered for payment, all obligations of 
the District and the County with respect to all outstanding Bonds will cease and terminate, except for the 
obligation of the County and the Paying Agent or an independent escrow agent selected by the District to 
pay or cause to be paid from funds deposited pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) above, to the owners of the 
Bonds not so surrendered and paid all sums due with respect thereto. 

 
“Defeasance  Securities”  means  direct  and  general  obligations  of  the  United  States  of  America 
(including State and Local Government Series), or obligations that are unconditionally guaranteed as to 
principal  and  interest  by  the  United  States  of  America,  including  (in  the  case  of  direct  and  general 
obligations  of  the  United  States  of  America)  evidence  of  direct  ownership  or  proportionate  interests  in 
future interest or principal payments of such obligations. Investments in such proportionate interests must 
be  limited  to  circumstances  wherein;  (a)  a  bank  or  trust  company  acts  as  custodian  and  holds  the 
underlying Defeasance Securities; (b) the owner of the investment is the real party in interest and has the 
right to proceed directly and individually against the obligor of the underlying Defeasance Securities; and 
(c) the underlying Defeasance Securities are held in a special account, segregated from the custodian’s 
general assets, and are not available to satisfy any claims of the custodian, any person claiming through the 
custodian, or any person to whom the custodian may be obligated; provided that such obligations are rated 
or assessed “AA+” by Standard & Poor’s if the Bonds are then rated by Standard & Poor’s, and “Aaa” 
by Moody’s Investors Service if the Bonds are then rated by Moody’s Investors Service. 

 

Partial Defeasance 

 
A portion of the then-outstanding maturities of the Bonds may be defeased prior to maturity in 

the following ways: 

 

(a) Cash. By irrevocably depositing with a bank or trust company, in escrow, an amount of 
cash which, together with amounts then on deposit in the Interest and Sinking Fund, is sufficient 
to  pay  the  designated  outstanding  maturities  of  Bonds,  including  all  principal  and  interest  and 
premium, if any; or 

 
(b)  Defeasance  Securities.  By  irrevocably  depositing  with  a  bank  or  trust  company,  in 
escrow,  non-callable  Defeasance  Securities,  as  permitted  under  section  149(d)  of  the  Code, 
together with cash, if required, in such amount as will, in the opinion of an independent certified 
public  accountant,  together  with  interest  to  accrue  thereon  and  moneys  then  on  deposit  in  the 
Interest and Sinking Fund together with the interest to accrue thereon, be fully sufficient to pay 
and discharge the designated outstanding maturities of Bonds (including all principal and interest 
represented thereby and redemption premiums, if any), at or before their maturity date; 
 

then, notwithstanding that any such designated maturities of Bonds shall not have been surrendered for 
payment, all obligations of the District and the County with respect to all such outstanding maturities of 
Bonds will cease and terminate, except only the obligation of the Paying Agent to pay or cause to be paid 
from funds deposited pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) above, to the owners of the designated Bonds of 
such maturities not so surrendered and paid, all sums due with respect thereto.

Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Bonds 

 
So  long  as  any  of  the  Bonds  remain  outstanding,  the  District  will  cause  the  Paying  Agent  to 
maintain and keep at its principal office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange and 
transfer of the Bonds as provided in the Resolution (each, a “Bond Register”). Subject to the provisions 
of the Resolution, the person in whose name a Bond is registered on the Bond Register will be regarded as 
the  absolute  owner  of  that  Bond  for  all  purposes  of  the  Resolution.  Payment  of  or  on  account  of  the 
principal of any Bond will be made only to or upon the order of that person; neither the District, nor the 
Paying  Agent  will  be  affected  by  any  notice  to  the  contrary,  but  the  registration  may  be  changed  as 
provided  in  the  Resolution.  All  such  payments  will  be  valid  and  effectual  to  satisfy  and  discharge  the 
District’s liability upon the Bonds, including interest, to the extent of the amount or amounts so paid. 

 
In the event that the book-entry system as described above is no longer used with respect to the 

Bonds, the following provisions will govern the registration, transfer, and exchange of the Bonds. 

 
Any Bond may be exchanged for Bonds of the same series of like tenor, maturity, and outstanding 
principal  amount  or  maturity  value  (the  “Transfer  Amount”)  upon  presentation  and  surrender  at  the 
principal  office  of  the  Paying  Agent,  together  with  a  request  for  exchange  signed  by  the  owner  or  by  a 
person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Paying Agent. A Bond may be transferred 
on  the  Bond  Register  only  upon  presentation  and  surrender  of  the  Bond  at  the  principal  office  of  the 
Paying Agent together with an assignment executed by the owner or by a person legally empowered to do 
so in a form satisfactory to the Paying Agent. Upon exchange or transfer, the Paying Agent will complete, 
authenticate  and  deliver  a  new  Bond  or  Bonds  of  like  tenor  and  of  any  authorized  denomination  or 
denominations  requested  by  the  owner  equal  to  the  Transfer  Amount  of  the  Bond  surrendered  and 
bearing or accruing interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date. 

 
In all cases of exchanged or transferred Bonds, the District will sign and the Paying Agent will 
authenticate and deliver Bonds in accordance with the provisions of the Resolution. All fees and costs of 
transfer  will  be  paid  by  the  requesting  party.  Those  charges  may  be  required  to  be  paid  before  the 
procedure is begun for the exchange or transfer. All Bonds issued upon any exchange or transfer will be 
valid obligations of the District, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same security and benefit 
under the Resolution as the Bonds surrendered upon that exchange or transfer. 

 
Any Bond surrendered to the Paying Agent for payment, retirement, exchange, replacement or 
transfer will be canceled by the Paying Agent. The District may at any time deliver to the Paying Agent for 
cancellation any previously authenticated and delivered Bonds that the District may have acquired in any 
manner whatsoever, and those Bonds will be promptly canceled by the Paying Agent. Written reports of 
the surrender and cancellation of Bonds will be made to the District by the Paying Agent. The canceled 
Bonds will be retained for a period of time, then returned to the District or destroyed by the Paying Agent 
as directed by the District. 

 
Neither  the  District  nor  the  Paying  Agent  will  be  required  (a)  to  issue  or  transfer  any  Bonds 
during a period beginning with the opening of business on the 15th business day next preceding either any 
Interest  Payment  Date  or  any  date  of  selection  of  Bonds  to  be  redeemed  and  ending  with  the  close  of 
business on the Interest Payment Date or any day on which the applicable notice of redemption is given or 
(b) to transfer any Bonds which have been selected or called for redemption in whole or in part.

Refunding Plan 
 

A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Refunding Bonds will be deposited into an escrow 
fund (the “Escrow Fund”) to be created and maintained by U.S. Bank National Association, as escrow 
bank (the “Escrow Bank”), under an escrow deposit and trust agreement by and between the District and 
the Escrow Bank. The moneys deposited in the Escrow Fund will be in an amount sufficient to redeem the 
outstanding Refunded 2005 Authority Bonds (and, therefore, the 2005 District Bonds maturing on and 
after September 1, 2015) in full on September 1, 2014, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal 
amount of the Refunded 2005 Authority Bonds, plus accrued interest to such date. The moneys deposited 
in the Escrow Fund will be held in cash, uninvested, until such redemption date. 

 
The amounts held and invested by the Escrow Bank in the Escrow Fund are pledged solely to the payment 
of  amounts  due  and  payable  with  respect  to  the  Refunded  2005  Authority  Bonds.  The  funds  deposited  in  the 
Escrow Fund will not be available for the payment of debt service with respect to the Bonds.

THE DISTRICT 

 

General Information 

 
The District is an elementary district serving students in a portion of the City of Sunnyvale. The 
District operates eight elementary schools (K-5) and two middle schools (6-8). Students graduating from 
the District attend high school in the Fremont Union High School District. The District was established 
in 1904. 
 

Enrollment in the District for grades K-8 in the 2013-14 school year was 6,850 students, and is 
budgeted  at  6916  students  in  fiscal  year  2014-15.  For  fiscal  year  2014-15,  the  District  has  budgeted  for 
approximately  740  employees.  Budgeted  full-time-equivalent  positions  (FTEs)  include  386  certificated 
(credentialed  teaching)  staff  and  247  classified  (non-teaching)  staff.  These  figures  include  management 
personnel. The District has budgeted general fund expenditures of approximately $66,599,947 for fiscal 
year  2014-15.  Total  assessed  valuation  of  taxable  property  in  the  District  in  fiscal  year  2013-14  is 
$20,337,549,508. The District operates under the jurisdiction of the County Superintendent of Schools.  

 
The District is a “basic aid district,” which means that it receives a minimal amount of financial 
support from the State. Instead, the District is funded almost entirely by local property tax collections, 
which derive from the 1% countywide property tax levy required by statute. 

 

 

-13- 

 

Governing Board and Administration 

 
The District is governed by a five-member Board of Education, each member of which is elected 
to  a  four-year  term.  Elections  for  positions  to  the  District  Board  are  held  every  two  years,  alternating 
between two and three available positions.

SECURITY AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS 

 

General 
 
In  order  to  provide  sufficient  funds  for  repayment  of  principal  and  interest  when  due  on  the 
Bonds,  the  Board  of  Supervisors  of  the  County  is  empowered  and  is  obligated  to  levy  ad  valorem  taxes 
upon all property subject to taxation by the District, without limitation as to rate or amount (except as to 
certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates). Such taxes are in addition to other taxes levied 
upon property within the District, including the countywide tax of 1% of taxable value. When collected, 
the  tax  revenues  will  be  deposited  by  the  County  in  the  District’s  Interest  and  Sinking  Fund,  which  is 
required to be maintained by the County and to be used solely for the payment of bonds of the District. 

 

Property Taxation System 

 
Property tax revenues result from the application of the appropriate tax rate to the total assessed 
value  of  taxable  property  in  the  District.  School  districts  levy  property  taxes  for  payment  of  voter-
approved bonds and receive property taxes for general operating purposes as well. The District receives 
approximately 76% of its total general fund operating revenues from local property taxes. 

 
Local  property  taxation  is  the  responsibility  of  various  county  officers.  For  each  school  district 
located in a county, the county assessor computes the value of locally assessed taxable property. Based on 
the  assessed  value  of  property  and  the  scheduled  debt  service  on  outstanding  bonds  in  each  year,  the 
county auditor-controller computes the rate of tax necessary to pay such debt service, and presents the tax 
rolls (including rates of tax for all taxing jurisdictions in the county) to the county board of supervisors for 
approval. The county Director of Finance prepares and mails tax bills to taxpayers and collects the taxes. 
In addition, the Director of Finance, as ex officio treasurer of each school district located in the county, 
holds  and  invests  school  district  funds,  including  taxes  collected  for  payment  of  school  bonds,  and  is 
charged with payment of principal and interest on such bonds when due. Taxes on property in a school 
district whose boundaries extend into more than one county are administered separately by the county in 
which  the  property  is  located.  The  State  Board  of  Equalization  also  assesses  certain  special  classes  of 
property, as described later in this section. 

 

Assessed Valuation of Property Within the District 
 

Under Proposition 13, an amendment to the California Constitution adopted in 1978, the county 
assessor’s  valuation  of  real  property  is  established  as  shown  on  the  fiscal  year  1975-76  tax  bill,  or, 
thereafter,  as  the  appraised  value  of  real  property  when  purchased,  newly  constructed,  or  a  change  in 
ownership has occurred. Assessed value of property may be increased annually to reflect inflation at a rate 
not to exceed 2% per year, or reduced to reflect a reduction in the consumer price index or comparable 
data for the area under taxing jurisdiction or in the event of declining property value caused by substantial 
damage, destruction, market forces or other factors. As a result of these rules, real property that has been 
owned by the same taxpayer for many years can have an assessed value that is much lower than that of 
similar properties more recently sold, and may be lower than its own market value. Likewise, changes in 
ownership of property and reassessment of such property to market value commonly will lead to increases 
in aggregate assessed value even when the rate of inflation or consumer price index would not permit the 
full  2%  increase  on  any  property  that  has  not  changed  ownership.  See  “DISTRICT  FINANCIAL 
INFORMATION”  and  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING 
DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS.” 

 

-15- 

 

 
For  assessment  and  tax  collection  purposes,  property  is  classified  either  as  “secured”  or 
“unsecured,” and is listed accordingly on separate parts of the assessment roll. The “secured roll” is that 
part of the assessment roll containing State-assessed property and property (real or personal) for which 
there is a lien on real property sufficient, in the opinion of the county assessor, to secure payment of the 
taxes. All other property is “unsecured,” and is assessed on the “unsecured roll.” 

 
The greater the assessed value of taxable property in the District, the lower the tax rate necessary 
to generate taxes sufficient to pay scheduled debt service on the Bonds. The following table shows recent 
history of taxable property assessed valuation in the District. 

 
The table below shows the assessed valuation in the District for fiscal years 2004-05 to 2013-14.

Tax Levies and Delinquencies 

 
Beginning  in  1978-79,  Article  XIIIA  and  its  implementing  legislation  shifted  the  function  of 
property taxation primarily to the counties, except for levies to support prior-voted debt, and prescribed 
how levies on county-wide property values are to be shared with local taxing entities within each County. 

 
The following table reflects the historical secured tax levy and year-end delinquencies for general 

obligation bonds of the District.

Alternative Method of Tax Apportionment 

 
The  Board  of  Supervisors  of  the  County  has  approved  the  implementation  of  the  Alternative 
Method of Distribution of Tax Levies and Collections and of Tax Sale Proceeds (the “Teeter Plan”), as 
provided  for  in  section  4701  et  seq.  of  the  California  Revenue  and  Taxation  Code.  The  Teeter  Plan 
guarantees distribution of 100% of the general taxes levied to the taxing entities within the County, with 
the  County  retaining  all  penalties  and  interest  penalties  affixed  upon  delinquent  properties  and 
redemptions of subsequent collections. Under the Teeter Plan, the County apportions secured property 
taxes on a cash basis to local political subdivisions, including the District, for which the County acts as the 
tax-levying or tax-collecting agency. At the conclusion of each fiscal year, the County distributes 100% of 
any taxes delinquent as of June 30th to the respective taxing entities. 

 
The  Teeter  Plan  is  applicable  to  secured  property  tax  levies.  As  adopted  by  the  County,  the 
Teeter Plan excludes Mello-Roos Community Facilities Districts, special assessment districts, and benefit 
assessment districts. 

 
The Teeter Plan is to remain in effect unless the Board of Supervisors of the County orders its 
discontinuance or unless, prior to the commencement of any fiscal year of the County (which commences 
on  July  1),  the  Board  of  Supervisors  receives  a  petition  for  its  discontinuance  joined  in  by  resolutions 
adopted  by  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  participating  revenue  districts  in  the  County,  in  which  event  the 
Board of Supervisors is to order discontinuance of the Teeter Plan effective at the commencement of the 
subsequent fiscal year. The Board of Supervisors may also, after holding a public hearing on the matter, 
discontinue the Teeter Plan with respect to any tax levying agency or assessment levying agency in the 
County if the rate of secured tax delinquency in that agency in any year exceeds 3% of the total of all taxes 
and assessments levied on the secured roll in that agency. If the Teeter Plan is discontinued subsequent to 
its  implementation,  only  those  secured  property  taxes  actually  collected  would  be  allocated  to  political 
subdivisions (including the District) for which the County acts as the tax-levying or tax-collecting agency, 
but penalties and interest would be credited to the political subdivisions. 

 
The District is not aware of any petitions for the discontinuance of the Teeter Plan in the County.

Risk of Decline in Property Values; Earthquake Risk. Property values could be reduced by factors 
beyond  the  District’s  control,  including  earthquake  and  a  depressed  real  estate  market  due  to  general 
economic conditions in the County, the region and the State. 

 
Other  possible  causes  for  a  reduction  in  assessed  values  include  the  complete  or  partial 
destruction of taxable property caused by other natural or manmade disasters, such as flood, fire, toxic 
dumping, acts of terrorism, etc., or reclassification of property to a class exempt from taxation, whether by 
ownership or use (such as exemptions for property owned by State and local agencies and property used 
for  qualified  educational,  hospital,  charitable  or  religious  purposes).  Lower  assessed  values  could 
necessitate a corresponding increase in the annual tax rate to be levied to pay the principal of and interest 
on the Bonds. Issuance of additional bonds in the future might also cause the tax rate to increase, although 
the District does not currently have any voter authorization to issue additional bonds.

State-Assessed  Property.  Under  the  California  Constitution,  the  State  Board  of  Equalization 
assesses  property  of  State-regulated  transportation  and  communications  utilities,  including  railways, 
telephone and telegraph companies, and companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity. The Board of 
Equalization also is required to assess pipelines, flumes, canals and aqueducts lying within two or more 
counties. The value of property assessed by the Board of Equalization is allocated by a formula to local 
jurisdictions  in  the  county,  including  school  districts,  and  taxed  by  the  local  county  tax  officials  in  the 
same manner as for locally assessed property. Taxes on privately owned railway cars, however, are levied 
and  collected  directly  by  the  Board  of  Equalization.  Property  used  in  the  generation  of  electricity  by  a 
company  that  does  not  also  transmit  or  sell  that  electricity  is  taxed  locally  instead  of  by  the  Board  of 
Equalization.  Thus,  the  reorganization  of  regulated  utilities  and  the  transfer  of  electricity-generating 
property  to  non-utility  companies,  as  often  occurred  under  electric  power  deregulation  in  California, 
affects how those assets are assessed, and which local agencies benefit from the property taxes derived. In 
general,  the  transfer  of  State-assessed  property  located  in  the  District  to  non-utility  companies  will 
increase the assessed value of property in the District, since the property’s value will no longer be divided 
among all taxing jurisdictions in the County. The transfer of property located and taxed in the District to a 
State-assessed utility will have the opposite effect, generally reducing the assessed value in the District as 
the value is shared among the other jurisdictions in the County. The District is unable to predict future 
transfers  of  State-assessed  property  in  the  District  and  the  County,  the  impact  of  such  transfers  on  its 
utility  property  tax  revenues,  or  whether  future  legislation  or  litigation  may  affect  ownership  of  utility 
assets, the State’s methods of assessing utility property, or the method by which tax revenues of utility 
property is allocated to local taxing agencies, including the District. 

 
Appeals  of  Assessed  Valuation.  State  law  affords  an  appeal  procedure  to  taxpayers  who  disagree 
with  the  assessed  value  of  their  taxable  property.  Taxpayers  may  request  a  reduction  in  assessment 
directly from the County Assessor (the “Assessor”), who may grant or refuse the request, and may appeal 
an assessment directly to the County Board of Equalization, which rules on appealed assessments whether 
or not settled by the Assessor. The Assessor is also authorized to reduce the assessed value of any taxable 
property  upon  a  determination  that  the  market  value  has  declined  below  the  then-current  assessment, 
whether or not appealed by the taxpayer. 

 
The District can make no predictions as to the changes in assessed values that might result from 
pending  or  future  appeals  by  taxpayers.  Any  reduction  in  aggregate  District  assessed  valuation  due  to 
appeals, as with any reduction in assessed valuation due to other causes, will cause the tax rate levied to 
repay  the  Bonds  to  increase  accordingly,  so  that  the  fixed  debt  service  on  the  Bonds  (and  other 
outstanding bonds) may be paid. Any refund of paid taxes triggered by a successful assessment appeal will 
be debited by the County Tax Collector against all taxing agencies who received tax revenues, including 
the District. 

 
Proposition 8. Pursuant to California Proposition 8 of November 1978 (“Proposition 8”), property 
owners may apply for a reduction of their property tax assessment by filing a written application, in form 
prescribed  by  the  State  Board  of  Equalization,  with  the  appropriate  county  board  of  equalization  or 
assessment appeals board. In most cases, the appeal is filed because the applicant believes that present 
market conditions (such as residential home prices) cause the property to be worth less than its current 
assessed value. Any reduction in the assessment ultimately granted as a result of such appeal applies to the 
year for which application is made and during which the written application was filed. 

 
County assessors, at their discretion, may also, from time to time, review certain property types 
purchased  between  specific  time  periods  (e.g.,  all  single  family  homes  and  condominiums  purchased 

 

-22- 

 

shortly prior to widespread declines in the fair market value of residential real estate within the county) 
and  may  proactively,  temporarily  reduce  the  assessed  value  of  qualifying  properties  to  Proposition  8 
assessed values without owner appeal therefor. 

 
A property that has been reassessed under Proposition 8, whether pursuant to owner appeal or 
due  to  county  assessor  review,  is  subsequently  reviewed  annually  to  determine  its  lien  date  value. 
Assuming  no  change  in  ownership  or  new  construction,  and  if  and  as  market  conditions  improve,  the 
assessed value of a property with a Proposition 8 assessed value in place may increase as of each property 
tax lien date by more than the standard annual inflationary factor growth rate allowed under Article XIIIA 
(currently, a 2% annual maximum) until such assessed value again equals the Article XIIIA base year value 
for such property as adjusted for inflation and years of ownership, at which point such property is again 
taxed  pursuant  to  Article  XIIIA  and  base  year  values  may  not  be  increased  by  more  than  the  standard 
Article XIIIA annual inflationary factor growth rate. A change in ownership while a property is subject to a 
Proposition 8 reassessment assessed valuation will cause such assessed valuation to become fixed as a new 
Article XIIIA base year value for such property. A second type of assessment appeal involves a challenge 
to  the  base  year  value  of  an  assessed  property.  Appeals  for  reduction  in  the  base  year  value  of  an 
assessment,  if  successful,  reduce  the  assessment  for  the  year  in  which  the  appeal  is  taken  and 
prospectively thereafter. The base year is determined by the completion date of new construction or the 
date  of  change  of  ownership.  Any  base  year  appeal  must  be  made  within  four  years  of  the  change  of 
ownership or new construction date.  

 
No assurance can be given that property tax appeals or County assessor reviews in the future will 

not significantly reduce the assessed valuation of property within the District. 

 

Direct and Overlapping Debt 
 

Direct and Overlapping Debt. Set forth below is a schedule of direct and overlapping debt prepared 
by California Municipal Statistics Inc. The table is included for general information purposes only. The 
District  has  not  reviewed  this  table  for  completeness  or  accuracy  and  makes  no  representations  in 
connection therewith. The first column in the table names each public agency which has outstanding debt 
as of May 1, 2014, and whose territory overlaps the District in whole or in part. The second column shows 
the percentage of each overlapping agency’s assessed value located within the boundaries of the District. 
This percentage, multiplied by the total outstanding debt of each overlapping agency (which is not shown 
in  the  table)  produces  the  amount  shown  in  the  third  column,  which  is  the  apportionment  of  each 
overlapping agency’s outstanding debt to taxable property in the District. 

 
The table generally includes long-term obligations sold in the public credit markets by the public 
agencies listed. Such long-term obligations generally are not payable from revenues of the District (except 
as indicated) nor are they necessarily obligations secured by land within the District. In many cases, long-
term obligations issued by a public agency are payable only from the general fund or other revenues of 
such public agency.

COUNTY INVESTMENT POOL 

 
In accordance with Section 41001 of the California Education Code, each California public school 
district maintains substantially all of its operating funds in the county treasury of the county in which it is 
located,  and  each  county  treasurer-tax  collector  serves  as  ex  officio  treasurer  for  those  school  district 
located  within  the  county.  Each  treasurer-tax  collector  has  the  authority  to  invest  school  district  funds 
held in the county treasury. Generally, the treasurer-tax collector pools county funds with school district 
funds and funds from certain other public agencies and invests the cash. These pooled funds are carried at 
cost.  Interest  earnings  are  accounted  for  on  either  a  cash  or  accrual  basis  and  apportioned  to  pool 
participants on a regular basis. 
 

Each treasurer-tax collector is required to invest funds, including those pooled funds described 
above,  in  accordance  with  Section  53601  et  seq.  of  the  California  Government  Code.  In  addition,  each 
treasurer-tax collector is required to establish an investment policy which may impose further limitations 
beyond those required by the California Government Code. A copy of the County investment policy and 
periodic reports on the County investment pool are available from the Director of Finance, Santa Clara 
County 70 West Hedding Street, 2nd Floor, San Jose, California, 95110, Telephone: (408) 299-5200. It is 
not  intended  that  such  information  be  incorporated  into  this  Official  Statement  by  such  references. 
Certain  information  concerning  the  County’s  pooled  investment  portfolio  as  of  March  31,  2014,  is 
included here in APPEDIX D—COUNTY QUARTERLY INVESTMENT REPORT. 

 
 

LEGAL OPINIONS 

 
The proceedings in connection with the issuance of the Bonds are subject to the approval as to 
their legality of Quint & Thimmig LLP, Larkspur, California, Bond Counsel for the District. Certain legal 
matters  will  also  be  passed  upon  for  the  District  by  Quint  &  Thimmig  LLP,  Larkspur,  California,  as 
Disclosure  Counsel.  Certain  legal  matters  will  be  passed  upon  for  the  Underwriter  by  Nossaman  LLP, 
Irvine,  California.  The  fees  of  Bond  Counsel,  Disclosure  Counsel  and  Underwriter’s  counsel  are 
contingent upon the issuance and delivery of the Bonds.  

 
 

 

TAX MATTERS 

Federal  tax  law  contains  a  number  of  requirements  and  restrictions  which  apply  to  the  Bonds, 
including  investment  restrictions,  periodic  payments  of  arbitrage  profits  to  the  United  States, 
requirements regarding the proper use of bond proceeds and the facilities financed therewith, and certain 
other matters. The District has covenanted to comply with all requirements that must be satisfied in order 
for the interest on the Bonds to be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Failure 
to comply with certain of such covenants could cause interest on the Bonds to become includible in gross 
income for federal income tax purposes retroactively to the date of issuance of the Bonds. 

 
Subject to the District’s compliance with the above referenced covenants, under present law, in 
the  opinion  of  Quint  &  Thimmig  LLP,  Larkspur,  California,  Bond  Counsel,  interest  on  the  Bonds  is 
excludable  from  the  gross  income  of  the  owners  thereof  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  and  is  not 
included as an item of tax preference in computing the federal alternative minimum tax for individuals and 
corporations, but interest on the Bonds is taken into account, however, in computing an adjustment used 
in determining the federal alternative minimum tax for certain corporations. 

 

-25- 

 

 
In rendering its opinion, Bond Counsel will rely upon certifications of the District with respect to 
certain  material  facts  within  the  District’s  knowledge.  Bond  Counsel’s  opinion  represents  its  legal 
judgment based upon its review of the law and the facts that it deems relevant to render such opinion and 
is not a guarantee of a result. 

 
The  Code  includes  provisions  for  an  alternative  minimum  tax  (“AMT”)  for  corporations  in 
addition to the corporate regular tax in certain cases. The AMT, if any, depends upon the corporation’s 
alternative minimum taxable income (“AMTI”), which is the corporation’s taxable income with certain 
adjustments.  One  of  the  adjustment  items  used  in  computing  the  AMTI  of  a  corporation  (with  certain 
exceptions) is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such corporation’s “adjusted current earnings” 
over an amount equal to its AMTI (before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss 
deduction). “Adjusted current earnings” would include certain tax exempt interest, including interest on 
the Bonds. 

 
Ownership  of  the  Bonds  may  result  in  collateral  federal  income  tax  consequences  to  certain 
taxpayers,  including,  without  limitation,  corporations  subject  to  the  branch  profits  tax,  financial 
institutions, certain insurance companies, certain S corporations, individual recipients of Social Security 
or  Railroad  Retirement  benefits  and  taxpayers  who  may  be  deemed  to  have  incurred  (or  continued) 
indebtedness  to  purchase  or  carry  tax  exempt  obligations.  Prospective  purchasers  of  the  Bonds  should 
consult their tax advisors as to applicability of any such collateral consequences. 

 
The issue price (the “Issue Price”) for the Bonds is the price at which a substantial amount of the 
Bonds is first sold to the public. The Issue Price of the Bonds may be different from the price set forth, or 
the price corresponding to the yield set forth, on the inside cover page hereof. 

 
Owners of Bonds who dispose of Bonds prior to the stated maturity (whether by sale, redemption 
or otherwise), purchase Bonds in the initial public offering, but at a price different from the Issue Price or 
purchase Bonds subsequent to the initial public offering should consult their own tax advisors. 

 
If a Bond is purchased at any time for a price that is less than the Bond’s stated redemption price 
at maturity, the purchaser will be treated as having purchased a Bond with market discount subject to the 
market discount rules of the Code (unless a statutory de minimis rule applies). Accrued market discount is 
treated  as  taxable  ordinary  income  and  is  recognized  when  a  Bond  is  disposed  of  (to  the  extent  such 
accrued  discount  does  not  exceed  gain  realized)  or,  at  the  purchaser’s  election,  as  it  accrues.  The 
applicability of the market discount rules may adversely affect the liquidity or secondary market price of 
such  Bond.  Purchasers  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding  the  potential  implications  of 
market discount with respect to the Bonds. 

 
An investor may purchase a Bond at a price in excess of its stated principal amount. Such excess is 
characterized for federal income tax purposes as “bond premium” and must be amortized by an investor 
on a constant yield basis over the remaining term of the Bond in a manner that takes into account potential 
call dates and call prices. An investor cannot deduct amortized bond premium relating to a tax exempt 
bond. The amortized bond premium is treated as a reduction in the tax exempt interest received. As bond 
premium is amortized, it reduces the investor’s basis in the Bonds. Investors who purchase a Bond at a 
premium should consult their own tax advisors regarding the amortization of bond premium and its effect 
on  the  Bond’s  basis  for  purposes  of  computing  gain  or  loss  in  connection  with  the  sale,  exchange, 
redemption or early retirement of the Bonds. 

 

-26- 

 

 
There are or may be pending in the Congress of the United States legislative proposals, including 
some that carry retroactive effective dates, that, if enacted, could alter or amend the federal tax matters 
referred to above or affect the market value of the Bonds. It cannot be predicted whether or in what form 
any  such  proposal  might  be  enacted  or  whether,  if  enacted,  it  would  apply  to  bonds  issued  prior  to 
enactment.  Prospective  purchasers  of  the  Bonds  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding  any 
pending or proposed federal tax legislation. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any pending or 
proposed federal tax legislation. 

 
The  Internal  Revenue  Service  (the  “Service”)  has  an  ongoing  program  of  auditing  tax  exempt 
obligations to determine whether, in the view of the Service, interest on such tax exempt obligations is 
includible  in  the  gross  income  of  the  owners  thereof  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  It  cannot  be 
predicted  whether  or  not  the  Service  will  commence  an  audit  of  the  Bonds.  If  an  audit  is  commenced, 
under current procedures the Service may treat the District as a taxpayer and the Bond owners may have 
no  right  to  participate  in  such  procedure.  The  commencement  of  an  audit  could  adversely  affect  the 
market value and liquidity of the Bonds until the audit is concluded, regardless of the ultimate outcome. 

 
Payments  of  interest  on,  and  proceeds  of  the  sale,  redemption  or  maturity  of,  tax  exempt 
obligations, including the Bonds, are in certain cases required to be reported to the Service. Additionally, 
backup withholding may apply to any such payments to any Bond owner who fails to provide an accurate 
Form  W-9  Request  for  Taxpayer  Identification  Number  and  Certification,  or  a  substantially  identical 
form, or to any Bond owner who is notified by the Service of a failure to report any interest or dividends 
required to be shown on federal income tax returns. The reporting and backup withholding requirements 
do not affect the excludability of such interest from gross income for federal tax purposes. 

 
In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is exempt from California Person 

income taxes. 

 
Ownership of the Bonds may result in other state and local tax consequences to certain taxpayers. 
Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such collateral consequences arising with respect to the 
Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of 
any such state and local taxes. 

 
If  the  initial  offering  price  to  the  public  (excluding  bond  houses  and  brokers)  at  which  a 
Bond  is  sold  is  less  than  the  amount  payable  at  maturity  thereof,  then  such  difference  constitutes 
“original  issue  discount”  for  purposes  of  federal  income  taxes  and  State  of  California  personal 
income  taxes.  If  the  initial  offering price to the public (excluding bond houses  and brokers) at  which 
each  Certificate  is  sold  is  greater  than  the  amount  payable  at  maturity  thereof,  then  such  difference 
constitutes  “original  issue  premium”  for  purposes  of  federal  income  taxes  and  State  of  California 
personal  income  taxes.  De minimis original issue discount and original issue premium is disregarded. 
Owners  of  Bonds  with  original  issue  discount  or  original  issue  premium,  including  purchasers  who 
do  not  purchase in the original  offering,  should consult  their own tax advisors with respect to  federal 
income  tax  and  State  of  California  personal  income  tax  consequences  of  owning  such  Bonds. 

 
The complete text of the final opinion that Bond Counsel expects to deliver upon the issuance of 

the Bonds is set forth in APPENDIX E—FORMS OF OPINIONS OF BOND COUNSEL.

FINANCIAL ADVISOR 

 
Public Financial Management, Inc., San Francisco, California, has served as financial advisor (the 
“Financial Advisor”) to the District in connection with the issuance of the Bonds. The Financial Advisor 
is not obligated to undertake, and has not undertaken to make, an independent verification or to assume 
responsibility  for  the  accuracy,  completeness  or  fairness  of  the  information  contained  in  the  Official 
Statement. The fees of the Financial Advisor are contingent upon the sale and delivery of the Bonds. The 
Financial  Advisor  is  an  independent  advisory  firm  and  is  not  engaged  in  the  business  of  underwriting, 
trading or distributing municipal or other public securities. 

 
 

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE 

 
The  District  has  covenanted  for  the  benefit  of  holders  and  Beneficial  Owners  of  the  Bonds  to 
provide certain financial information and operating data relating to the District (the “Annual Report”) by 
not later than April 15 after the end of the District’s fiscal year (the current end of the District’s fiscal year 
is  on  June  30),  commencing  with  the  report  for  the  2013-14  fiscal  year,  and  to  provide  notices  of  the 
occurrence  of  certain  enumerated  events.  The  Annual  Report  will  be  filed  by  the  District  with  the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”). The notices of enumerated events will be filed by 
the  District  with  the  MSRB.  The  specific  nature  of  the  information  to  be  made  available  and  to  be 
contained  in  the  notices  of  material  events  is  summarized  below  under  the  caption  APPENDIX  F—
FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE CERTIFICATE. These covenants have been made in order 
to assist the Underwriter in complying with S.E.C. Rule 15c2-12(b)(5) (the “Rule”). 

 
It has been the District’s practice each year to prepare an annual report that includes information 
to satisfy the continuing disclosure requirements for all of its outstanding issues and files the same report 
with  the  MSRB  on  the  appropriate  pages  of  the  MSRB’s  Electronic  Municipal  Market  Access 
(“EMMA”) website for each issue. In connection with the preparation of this official statement, it was  
discovered that the combined annual report posted in 2012 for the District’s 2011 fiscal year inadvertently 
omitted  such  posting  on  the  EMMA  webpage  for  the  District’s  General  Obligation  Bonds,  Election  of 
2004, Series C. That filing have now been made. In addition, in once instance, the District filed a material 
event notice relating to the downgrade of the rating of the municipal bond insurer for the District’s 2003 
General Obligation Refunding Bonds, General Obligation Bonds, Election of 2004, Series A, and General 
Obligation Bonds, Election of 2004, Series B, and for the 2005 Authority Bonds, 21 days rather than 10 
days after such downgrade. 

 
 

LEGALITY FOR INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA 

 
Under  provisions  of  the  California  Financial  Code,  the  Bonds  are  legal  investments  for 
commercial  banks  in  California  to  the  extent  that  the  Bonds,  in  the  informed  opinion  of  the  bank,  are 
prudent  for  the  investment  of  funds  of  depositors,  and  under  provisions  of  the  California  Government 
Code, are eligible for security for deposits of public moneys in California. 

 
 

ABSENCE OF MATERIAL LITIGATION 

 
No litigation is pending or threatened concerning the validity of the Bonds, and a certificate to 
that effect will be furnished by the District to purchasers at the time of the original delivery of the Bonds. 

 

-28- 

 

The District is not aware of any litigation pending or threatened questioning the political existence of the 
District or contesting the District’s ability to receive ad valorem taxes or contesting the District’s ability to 
issue and retire the Bonds. 

 
 

RATINGS 

 
Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, a Standard & 
Poor’s  Financial  Services  LLC  business  (“S&P”),  have  assigned  the  ratings  of  “Aa2”  and  “AA+,” 
respectively,  to  the  Bonds.  Such  ratings  reflect  only  the  view  of  Moody’s  and  S&P  and  any  desired 
explanation of the significance of such rating should be obtained from Moody’s at 7 World Trade Center, 
250 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10007, and from S&P at 55 Water Street, New York, NY 10041. 
Generally,  a  rating  agency  bases  it  rating  on  the  information  and  materials  furnished  to  it  and  on 
investigations, studies and assumptions of its own. There is no assurance such ratings will continue for 
any  given  period  of  time  or  that  such  ratings  will  not  be  revised  downward  or  withdrawn  entirely  by 
Moody’s and/or S&P, if in the judgment of Moody’s and /or S&P, circumstances so warrant. Any such 
downward revision or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price for the 
Bonds.

APPENDIX B 

 

DISTRICT AND GENERAL SCHOOL DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

 
The information in this appendix concerning the operations of the District, the District’s finances, and 
State funding of education, is provided as supplementary information only, and it should not be inferred from the 
inclusion of this information in this Official Statement that the principal of and interest on the Bonds is payable 
from the general fund of the District or from State revenues. The Bonds are payable from the proceeds of an ad 
valorem  tax  approved  by  the  voters  of  the  District  pursuant  to  all  applicable  laws  and  State  Constitutional 
requirements, and required to be levied by the County on property within the District in an amount sufficient for 
the timely payment of principal and interest on the Bonds. See “SECURITY AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT 
FOR THE BONDS” in the Official Statement. 

 
 

District Budget 

 
The District is required by provisions of the California Education Code to maintain a balanced 
budget each year, in which the sum of expenditures and the ending fund balance cannot exceed the sum of 
revenues  and  the  carry-over  fund  balance  from  the  previous  year.  The  State  Department  of  Education 
imposes a uniform budgeting and accounting format for school districts. The budget process for school 
districts  was  substantially  amended  by  Assembly  Bill  1200  (“AB  1200”),  which  became  State  law  on 
October 14, 1991. Portions of AB 1200 are summarized below. 

 
School  districts  must  adopt  a  budget  on  or  before  July  1  of  each  year.  The  budget  must  be 
submitted to the county superintendent within five days of adoption or by July 1, whichever occurs first. A 
district  may  be  on  either  a  dual  or  single  budget  cycle.  The  dual  budget  option  requires  a  revised  and 
readopted budget by September 8 that is subject to State-mandated standards and criteria. The revised 
budget must reflect changes in projected income and expenses subsequent to July 1. The single budget is 
only readopted if it is disapproved by the county office of education, or as needed. The District is on a 
single budget cycle and adopts its budget on or before July 1. 

 
For both dual and single budgets submitted on July 1, the county superintendent will examine the 
adopted budget for compliance with the standards and criteria adopted by the State Board of Education 
and  identify  technical  corrections  necessary  to  bring  the  budget  into  compliance,  will  determine  if  the 
budget allows the district to meet its current obligations and will determine if the budget is consistent with 
a financial plan that will enable the district to meet its multi-year financial commitments. On or before 
August  15,  the  county  superintendent  will  approve  or  disapprove  the  adopted  budget  for  each  school 
district. Budgets will be disapproved if they fail the above standards. The district board must be notified 
by  August  15  of  the  county  superintendent’s  recommendations  for  revision  and  reasons  for  the 
recommendations.  The  county  superintendent  may  assign  a  fiscal  advisor  or  appoint  a  committee  to 
examine  and  comment  on  the  superintendent’s  recommendations.  The  committee  must  report  its 
findings  no  later  than  August  20.  Any  recommendations  made  by  the  county  superintendent  must  be 
made available by the district for public inspection. The law does not provide for conditional approvals; 
budgets must be either approved or disapproved. No later than September 22, the county superintendent 
must  notify  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  of  all  school  districts  whose  budget  may  be 
disapproved. 

 

Appendix B 

Page 1 

 

For  all  dual  budget  options  and  for  single  and  dual  budget  option  districts  whose  budgets  have 
been disapproved, the district must revise and readopt its budget by September 8, reflecting changes in 
projected  income  and  expense  since  July  1,  including  responding  to  the  county  superintendent’s 
recommendations. The county superintendent must determine if the budget conforms with the standards 
and criteria applicable to final district budgets and not later than October 8, will approve or disapprove the 
revised budgets. If the budget is disapproved, the county superintendent will call for the formation of a 
budget review committee pursuant to section 42127.1 of the California Education Code. Until a district’s 
budget is approved, the district will operate on the lesser of its proposed budget for the current fiscal year 
or the last budget adopted and reviewed for the prior fiscal year. 

 
Under the provisions of AB 1200, each school district is required to file interim certifications with 
the  county  office  of  education  as  to  its  ability  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  for  the  remainder  of  the 
then-current fiscal year and, based on current forecasts, for the subsequent two fiscal years. The county 
office of education reviews the certification and issues either a positive, negative or qualified certification. 
A  positive  certification  is  assigned  to  any  school  district  that  will  meet  its  financial  obligations  for  the 
current  fiscal  year  and  subsequent  two  fiscal  years.  A  negative  certification  is  assigned  to  any  school 
district  that  will  be  unable  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  for  the  remainder  of  the  fiscal  year  or  the 
subsequent  fiscal  year.  A  qualified  certification  is  assigned  to  any  school  district  that  may  not  meet  its 
financial obligations for the current fiscal year or two subsequent fiscal years. 

 
The  District’s  Second  Interim  Report  for  fiscal  year  2013-14,  adopted  March  20,  2014,  was 
certified as “Positive.” The District has not received a qualified or negative certification in any of the last 
five years.

Accounting Practices 

 
The accounting practices of the District conform to generally accepted accounting principles in 
accordance  with  policies  and  procedures  of  the  California  School  Accounting  Manual.  This  manual, 
according  to  section  41010  of  the  California  Education  Code,  is  to  be  followed  by  all  California  school 
districts. 

Appendix B 

Page 3 

 

 
The District’s expenditures are accrued at the end of the fiscal year to reflect the receipt of goods 
and  services  in  that  year.  Revenues  generally  are  recorded  on  a  cash  basis,  except  for  items  that  are 
susceptible to accrual (measurable and/or available to finance operations). Current taxes are considered 
susceptible to accrual. Delinquent taxes not received after the fiscal year end are not recorded as revenue 
until received. Revenues from specific state and federally funded projects are recognized when qualified 
expenditures have been incurred. State block grant apportionments are accrued to the extent that they are 
measurable and predictable. The State Department of Education sends the District updated information 
from time to time explaining the acceptable accounting treatment of revenue and expenditure categories. 

 
The District’s accounting is organized on the basis of fund groups, with each group consisting of a 
separate  set  of  self-balancing  accounts  containing  assets,  liabilities,  fund  balances,  revenues  and 
expenditures. The major fund classification is the general fund which accounts for all financial resources 
not requiring a special type of fund. The District’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. 

 

Appendix B

Financial Statements 

 
The  District’s  general  fund  finances  the  basic  operating  activities  of  the  District.  General  fund 
revenues  are  derived  from  such  sources  as  State  school  fund  apportionments,  taxes,  use  of  money  and 
property, and aid from other governmental agencies. Audited financial statements for the District for the 
fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, and prior fiscal years are on file with the District and available for public

Summary of District Revenues and Expenditures 

 
See  “SCHOOL  DISTRICT  BUDGET  PROCEDURES  AND  REQUIREMENTS—District 
Budget Process and County Review” for a general description of the annual budget process for California 
school  districts.  The  District’s  audited  financial  statements  for  the  year  ending  June  30,  2013,  are 
reproduced in Appendix C. The final (unaudited) statement of receipts and expenditures for each fiscal 
year ending June 30 is required by State law to be approved by the District Board by September 15, and the 
audit report must be filed with the County Superintendent of Schools and State officials by December 15 
of each year. 

 
The District is required by State law and regulation to maintain various reserves. The District is 
generally required to maintain a reserve for economic uncertainties in the amount of 3% of its total general 
fund expenditures, based on total student attendance below 30,000. For fiscal year 2013-14, the District 
has budgeted an unrestricted general fund reserve of 5.47%, or approximately $3,641,515. Substantially all 
funds  of  the  District  are  required  by  law  to  be  deposited  with  and  invested  by  the  County  Director  of 
Finance on behalf of the District, pursuant to law and the investment policy of the County. See “SANTA 
CLARA COUNTY INVESTMENT POOL.” 

 

District Revenues—LCFF/Basic Aid 
 

As part of the 2013-14 State Budget, the formula for determining the level of funding per student 
changed  from  the  “revenue  limit”  formula  to  the  “Local  Control  Funding  Formula”  (or  “LCFF”) 
discussed  below.  See  “—  State  Funding  of  Education;  State  Budget  Process—Local  Control  Funding 
Formula”  below.  The  California  Department  of  Education  has  not  yet  provided  an  update  to  the 
Standardized Accounting Code Structure (which all school districts in California use to account for their 
funds).  
 
Under section 42238 et seq. of the California Education Code, prior to fiscal year 2013-14, each 
school  district  was  determined  to  have  a  target  funding  level:  a  “base  revenue  limit”  per  student 
multiplied by the district’s student enrollment measured in units of average daily attendance (“A.D.A.”). 
The  base  revenue  limit  was  calculated  from  the  district’s  prior-year  funding  level,  as  adjusted  for  a 
number  of  factors,  such  as  inflation,  special  or  increased  instructional  needs  and  costs,  employee 
retirement  costs,  especially  low  enrollment,  increased  pupil  transportation  costs,  etc.  Generally,  the 
amount of State funding allocated to each school district was the amount needed to reach that district’s 
base  revenue  limit  after  taking  into  account  certain  other  revenues,  in  particular,  locally  generated 
property taxes. This is referred to as State “equalization aid.” To the extent local tax revenues increase 
due  to  growth  in  local  property  assessed  valuation,  the  additional  revenue  is  offset  by  a  decline  in  the 
State’s contribution.  

  
The 2013-14 State Budget replaced the former K-12 finance system with the LCFF. The LCFF 
creates  base,  supplemental  and  concentration  grants  as  the  new  general  purpose  entitlement  to  replace 
most  existing  funding  streams,  including  the  State  aid  portion  of  the  revenue  limit  and  most  State 
categorical  programs  from  prior  years.  The  2013-14  State  Budget  provides  an  additional  $2.1  billion  of 
funding  to  school  districts  and  charter  schools  to  support  the  first-year  implementation  of  the  LCFF. 
Until full implementation, however, school districts will receive roughly the same amount of funding they 
received in 2012-13 plus an additional amount each year to bridge the gap between former funding levels 
and  the  new  LCFF  target  levels.  The  2013-14  State  Budget  projects  the  time  frame  for  full 

Appendix B 

Page 6 

 

implementation of the LCFF to be eight years. For more information on the LCFF, see “—State Funding 
of Education; State Budget Process—Local Control Funding Formula” below. 

 
Funding of the District’s local control funding is provided by a mix of local property taxes and 
State aid. Local control funding formula revenues comprised approximately 76% of the District’s general 
fund revenues in 2013-14. 

 
School  districts  that  receive  their  LCFF  income  entirely  from  property  taxes  are  called  “basic 
aid”  school  districts.  They  are  permitted  to  keep  all  their  property  tax  money  (even  if  it  exceeds  their 
LCFF). As guaranteed in the California Constitution, the State must apportion $120 per pupil. However, 
the categorical aid that school districts receive counts toward this requirement. The District is a basic aid 
district because its property tax revenue exceeds the LCFF entitlements. 

 

Implementation of the LCFF  
 

The California Department of Education (the “CDE”) cannot immediately determine how much 
a school district is entitled to receive under the LCFF because funding is based on current year attendance 
data not known until the end of the fiscal year and because the CDE must reprogram its apportionment 
systems to reflect the new formula calculations.  

 
However,  because  the  greater  part  of  a  school  district’s  funding  is  based  on  what  the  school 
received in fiscal year 2012-13, the CDE will apportion funds during the advance principal apportionment 
and first principal apportionment periods based on fiscal year 2012-13 funding, and according to the fiscal 
year  2012-13  model  (not  the  LCFF),  plus  a  portion  of  the  $2.1  billion  appropriated  to  begin 
implementation  of  the  provisions  of  the  LCFF.  The  CDE  has  indicated  that  the  second  principal 
apportionment  will  be  based  on  the  LCFF.  The  fiscal  year  2013-14  budgetary  information  that  follows, 
which discusses the District’s revenues and expenditures, does so under the 2012-13 budget model, and 
does not reflect how funds will be apportioned once the LCFF is implemented.  

 
Effect of Changes in Enrollment. Changes in local property tax income and student enrollment (or 
A.D.A.)  affect  revenue  limit  districts  and  basic  aid  districts  differently.  In  a  revenue  limit  district, 
increasing enrollment increases the total revenue limit and thus generally increases a district’s entitlement 
to State equalization aid, while increases in property taxes do nothing to increase district revenues, but 
only offset the State funding requirement of equalization aid. Operating costs increase disproportionately 
slowly to enrollment growth—and only at the point where additional teachers and classroom facilities are 
needed. Declining enrollment has the reverse effect on revenue limit districts, generally resulting in a loss 
of State equalization aid, while operating costs decrease slowly and only when, for example, the district 
decides to lay off teachers or close schools. Enrollment can fluctuate due to factors such as population 
growth, competition from private, parochial, and public charter schools, inter-district transfers in or out, 
and  other  causes.  Losses  in  enrollment  will  cause  a  school  district  to  lose  operating  revenues,  without 
necessarily permitting the District to make adjustments in fixed operating costs.  

 
In  basic  aid  districts,  the  opposite  is  generally  true:  increasing  enrollment  does  increase  the 
revenue limit, but since all revenue limit income (and more) is already generated by local property taxes, 
there is no increase in State income, other than the $120 per student in basic aid received in the form of 
categorical  aid,  as  described  above.  Meanwhile,  as  new  students  impose  increased  operating  costs, 
property tax income is stretched further. Declining enrollment does not reduce property tax income, and 

Appendix B 

Page 7 

 

has a negligible impact on State aid, but eventually reduces operating costs, and thus can be financially 
beneficial to a basic aid district.  

 
For LCFF districts, any loss of local property taxes is made up by an increase in State equalization 
aid,  until  the  base  revenue  limit  is  reached.  For  basic  aid  districts,  the  loss  of  tax  revenues  is  not 
reimbursed by the State. 

 
State  funds  for  special  (categorical)  programs  in  fiscal  year  2013-14  which  include  moneys 
received from the State lottery fund, have been reduced by the “fair share” reduction the District expects 
the State to impose on basic aid districts in fiscal year 2013-14. The District has budgeted a net amount of 
State  categorical  and  lottery  funds  received  to  approximately  $3,565,529  in  fiscal  year  2013-14.  Lottery 
funds  may  not  be  used  for  non-instructional  purposes,  such  as  the  acquisition  of  real  property,  the 
construction of facilities, or the financing of research. School districts receive lottery funds proportional to 
their total A.D.A. The District’s total State lottery revenue is budgeted at $1,059,918, or approximately 
2% of general fund revenue in fiscal year 2013-14. 

 
The District cannot make any predictions regarding how the current economic environment or 
changes thereto will affect the State’s ability to meet the revenue and spending assumptions in the State’s 
adopted budget, and the effect of these changes on school finance. Certain adjustments will have to be 
made throughout the year based on actual State funding and actual attendance.  

 

Other Local Revenues 
 

The  District  receives  additional  local  revenues  from  items  such  as  leases  and  rentals,  special 
education support and other local sources. Other local sources comprised approximately 16% of general 
fund  revenues  in  fiscal  year  2012-13  and  are  estimated  to  equal  approximately  15%  of  such  revenues  in 
fiscal year 2013-14. 
 
District Expenditures 
 

The largest part of each school district’s general fund budget is used to pay salaries and benefits of 
certificated  (credentialed  teaching)  and  classified  (non-instructional)  employees.  Changes  in  salary  and 
benefit expenditures from year to year are generally based on changes in staffing levels, negotiated salary 
increases, and the overall cost of employee benefits. 

 
In  its  2014-15  budget,  the  District  estimates  that  it  will  expend  $54,688,821  in  salaries  and 
benefits,  or  approximately  82%  of  its  general  fund  expenditures.  This  amount  represents  an  increase  of 
approximately 5% from the $52,211,383 the District expended in 2013-14.

Retirement  Programs.  Qualified  employees  are  covered  under  multiple-employer  contributory 
retirement plans maintained by agencies of the State of California. Certificated employees are members of 
the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), and classified employees are members of 
the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). 

 

California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) 

 
Plan  Description.  The  District  contributes  to  the  School  Employer  Pool  under  the  California 
Public  Employees’  Retirement  System  (CalPERS),  a  cost-sharing  multiple-employer  public  employee 
retirement system defined benefit pension plan administered by CalPERS. The plan provides retirement 
and  disability  benefits,  annual  cost-of-living  adjustments,  and  death  benefits  to  plan  members  and 
beneficiaries.  Benefit  provisions  are  established  by  State  statutes,  as  legislatively  amended,  within  the 
Public  Employees’  Retirement  Law.  CalPERS  issues  a  separate  comprehensive  annual  financial  report 
that includes financial statements and required supplementary information. Copies of the CalPERS annual 
financial  report  may  be  obtained  from  the  CalPERS  Executive  Office,  400  Q  Street,  Sacramento,  CA 
95811. 

 
Funding Policy. Active plan members are required to contribute 7.0 percent of their salary and the 
District is required to contribute an actuarially determined rate. The actuarial methods and assumptions 
used for determining the rate are those adopted by the CalPERS Board of Administration. The required 
employer contribution rates for fiscal years 2013-14, 2012-13, 2011-12 and 2010-11 were 11.442%, 11.417, 
11.707,  and  9.709  percent  of  covered  payroll,  respectively.  The  contribution  requirements  of  the  plan 
members  are  established  by  State  statute.  The  District’s  contributions  to  CalPERS  for  the  fiscal  years 
ending June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, were $1,169,818, 1,096,057, and 1,060,531, respectively, and equal 
100 percent of the required contributions for each year.

State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) 
 

District  contributes  to  the  California  State  Teachers’  Retirement  System  (CalSTRS),  a  cost-
sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system defined benefit pension plan administered 
by  CalSTRS.  The  plan  provides  retirement,  disability,  and  survivor  benefits  to  plan  members  and 
beneficiaries.  Benefit  provisions  are  established  by  State  statutes,  as  legislatively  amended,  within  the 
State Teachers’ Retirement Law. CalSTRS issues a separate comprehensive annual financial report that 
includes  financial  statements  and  required  supplementary  information.  Copies  of  the  STRS  annual 
financial  report  may  be  obtained  from  the  STRS,  100  Waterfront  Place,  West  Sacramento,  California 
95605. 

 
Funding  Policy.  Active  plan  members  are  required  to  contribute  8.0%  of  their  salary  and  the 
District is required to contribute an actuarially determined rate. The actuarial methods and assumptions 
used  for  determining  the  rate  are  those  adopted  by  the  CalSTRS  Teachers'  Retirement  Board.  The 
required employer contribution rate for fiscal year 2012-13 was 8.25% of annual payroll. The contribution 
requirements  of  the  plan  members  are  established  by  State  statute.  The  District’s  contributions  to 
CalSTRS  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  June  30,  2013,  2012,  and  2011,  were  $2,539,801,  $2,230,757,  and 
$2,258,663, respectively, and equal 100% of the required contributions for each year. 

 
Social Security. As established by federal law, all public sector employees who are not members of 
their employer’s existing retirement system (CalSTRS or CalPERS) must be covered by social security or 
an alternative plan. The District has elected to use Social Security as its alternative plan.  

 
On-Behalf Payments Made by the State of California. The State of California makes contributions to 
CalSTRS  on  behalf  of  the  District.  These  payments  consist  of  State  General  Fund  contributions  to 
CalSTRS  for  the  fiscal  years  ending  on  June  30,  2013,  2012  and  2011  in  the  amounts  of  $1,442,507, 
1,328,913 and 1,189,289, respectively. 

 
See also APPENDIX C—AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE DISTRICT FOR 

THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013, Note 13. 

 

Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) 
 

Plan  Descriptions.  The  Postemployment  Benefit  Plan  (the  “Plan”)  is  a  single-employer  defined 
benefit healthcare plan administered by the Sunnyvale School District. The Plan provides medical, dental 
and vision insurance benefits to eligible retirees and their spouses until the age of 65. Membership of the 
Plan consists of 49 retirees and 628 active plan members as of the most recent actuarial valuation. 

 
Funding Policy. The contribution requirements of plan members and the District are established 
and  may  be  amended  by  the  District,  the  District’s  bargaining  units  and  unrepresented  groups.  The 
required  contribution  is  based  on  projected  pay-as-you-go  financing  requirements,  with  an  additional 
amount  to  prefund  benefits  as  determined  annually  through  the  agreements  between  the  District,  the 
District’s bargaining units and the unrepresented groups. For fiscal year 2012-13, the District contributed 
$586,757 to the plan, all of which was used for current premiums (approximately 70 percent of the current 
year’s annual OPEB costs). The District contributed 100% of the total premium on behalf of the members 
and 70% for the dependents of the plan members receiving benefits.

 Actuarial  Methods  and  Assumptions.  Projections  of  benefits  for  financial  reporting  purposes  are 
based on the substantive plan (the plan as understood by the employer and plan members) and include the 
types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing benefit costs 
between  the  employer  and  plan  members  to  that  point.  The  actuarial  methods  and  assumptions  used 
include techniques that are designed to reduce the effects of short-term volatility in actuarially accrued 
liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long-term perspective of the calculations. 

 
In  the  July  1,  2012,  actuarial  valuation,  the  projected  unit  credit  cost  method  was  used.  The 
actuarial assumptions included a five percent investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses), 
based  on  the  District’s  assumed  long-term  return  on  plan  assets  or  employer  assets.  Healthcare  costs 
trend  rates  range  from  an  initial  eight  percent  to  an  ultimate  rate  of  five  percent.  The  UAAL  is  being 
amortized at a level percentage of payroll method. The remaining amortization period at July 1, 2011, was 
30 years on an open period method.

Governor’s  Pension  Reform.  On  August  28,  2012,  Governor  Brown  and  the  State  Legislature 
reached  agreement  on  a  new  law  that  reforms  pensions  for  State  and  local  government  employees.  AB 
340,  which  was  signed  into  law  on  September  12,  2012,  established  the  California  Public  Employees’ 
Pension Reform Act of 2012 (“PEPRA”) which governs pensions for public employers and public pension 
plans  on  and  after  January  1,  2013.  For  new  employees,  PEPRA,  among  other  things,  caps  pensionable 
salaries  at  the  Social  Security  contribution  and  wage  base,  which  is  $110,100  for  2012,  or  120%  of  that 
amount for employees not covered by Social Security, increases the retirement age by two years or more 
for all new public employees while adjusting the retirement formulas, requires state employees to pay at 
least half of their pension costs, and also requires the calculation of benefits on regular, recurring pay to 
stop income spiking. For all employees, changes required by PEPRA include the prohibition of retroactive 
pension increases, pension holidays and purchases of service credit. PEPRA applies to all State and local 
public  retirement  systems,  including  county  and  district  retirement  systems.  PEPRA  only  exempts  the 
University of California system and charter cities and counties whose pension plans are not governed by 
State law. Although the District anticipates that PEPRA would not increase the District’s future pension 
obligations,  the  District  is  unable  to  determine  the  extent  of  any  impact  PEPRA  would  have  on  the 
District’s  pension  obligations  at  this  time.  Additionally,  the  District  cannot  predict  if  PEPRA  will  be 
challenged in court and, if so, whether any challenge would be successful. 

 
The District is unable to predict what the amount of State pension liabilities will be in the future, 

or the amount of the contributions which the District may be required to make. 

 

District Debt Structure 
 

General  Obligation  Bonds.  The  District  has  bonds  outstanding  under  two  voter  approved  bond 
authorizations. On June 4, 1996, voters of the District approved Measure A, authorizing the District to 
issue up to $34 million in general obligation bonds. The District issued these bonds in three series. The 
District has issued substantially all bonds authorized under Measure A. On November 2, 2004, voters of 
the District approved Measure P, authorizing the District to issue up to $120 million in general obligation 
bonds.  The  District  has  issued  substantially  all  bonds  authorized  under  Measure  P.  In  addition,  the 
District issued bonds in 2005 to refund bonds issued in 1996 and issued bonds in 2012 to refund bonds 
issued in 2003.

CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES 

AND APPROPRIATIONS 

 
 The principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable from the proceeds of an ad valorem tax levied by 
the  County  for  the  payment  thereof.  (See  “THE  BONDS—Security.”)  Articles  XIIIA,  XIIIB,  XIIIC  and 
XIIID  of  the  California  Constitution,  Propositions  98,  111,  218  and  39,  and  certain  other  provisions  of  law 
discussed below, are included in this section to describe the potential effect of these Constitutional and statutory 
measures on the ability of the County to levy taxes and of the District to spend tax proceeds and it should not be 
inferred from the inclusion of such materials that these laws impose any limitation on the ability of the County to 
levy taxes for payment of the Bonds. The tax levied by the County for payment of the Bonds was approved by the 
District’s voters in compliance with Article XIIIA, Article XIIIC, and all applicable laws. 

 

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution 
 

Article XIIIA of the State Constitution, adopted and known as Proposition 13, was approved by 
the voters in June 1978. Section 1(a) of Article XIIIA limits the maximum ad valorem tax on real property 
to 1% of “full cash value,” and provides that such tax shall be collected by the counties and apportioned 
according to State law. Section 1(b) of Article XIIIA provides that the 1% limitation does not apply to ad 
valorem taxes levied to pay interest and redemption charges on (i) indebtedness approved by the voters 
prior  to  July  1,  1978,  or  (ii)  bonded  indebtedness  for  the  acquisition  or  improvement  of  real  property 
approved  on  or  after  July  1,  1978,  by  two-thirds  of  the  votes  cast  on  the  proposition,  or  (iii)  bonded 
indebtedness  incurred  by  a  school  district  or  community  college  district  for  the  construction, 
reconstruction, rehabilitation or replacement of school facilities or the acquisition or lease of real property 
for  school  facilities,  approved  by  55%  of  the  voters  of  the  district,  but  only  if  certain  accountability 
measures  are  included  in  the  proposition.  The  tax  for  payment  of  the  District’s  bonds  approved  at  the 
2006 and 2008 elections falls within the exception for bonds approved by a 55% vote. 

 
Section 2 of Article XIIIA defines “full cash value” to mean the county assessor’s valuation of 
real  property  as  shown  on  the  fiscal  year  1975-76  tax  bill,  or,  thereafter,  the  appraised  value  of  real 
property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred. The full cash value 
may be adjusted annually to reflect inflation at a rate not to exceed 2% per year, or to reflect a reduction in 
the consumer price index or comparable data for the area under taxing jurisdiction, or may be reduced in 
the  event  of  declining  property  value  caused  by  substantial  damage,  destruction  or  other  factors.  The 
Revenue  and  Taxation  Code  permits  county  assessors  who  have  reduced  the  assessed  valuation  of  a 
property  as  a  result  of  natural  disasters,  economic  downturns  or  other  factors,  to  subsequently 
“recapture”  such  value  (up  to  the  pre-decline  value  of  the  property)  at  an  annual  rate  higher  than  2%, 
depending  on  the  assessor’s  measure  of  the  restored  value  of  the  damaged  property.  The  State  courts 
have  upheld  the  constitutionality  of  this  procedure.  Legislation  enacted  by  the  State  Legislature  to 
implement Article XIIIA provides that, notwithstanding any other law, local agencies may not levy any ad 
valorem  property  tax  except  the  1%  base  tax  levied  by  each  county  and  taxes  to  pay  debt  service  on 
indebtedness approved by the voters as described above. 

 
Since its adoption, Article XIIIA has been amended a number of times. These amendments have 
created a number of exceptions to the requirement that property be reassessed when purchased, newly 
constructed  or  a  change  in  ownership  has  occurred.  These  exceptions  include  certain  transfers  of  real 
property between family members, certain purchases of replacement dwellings for persons over age 55 and 
by  property  owners  whose  original  property  has  been  destroyed  in  a  declared  disaster,  and  certain 

Appendix B 

Page 15 

 

improvements  to  accommodate  disabled  persons  and  for  seismic  upgrades  to  property.  These 
amendments have resulted in marginal reductions in the property tax revenues of the District. 

 
Both the State Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court have upheld the validity of 

Article XIIIA. 

 

Legislation Implementing Article XIIIA 
 

Legislation  has  been  enacted  and  amended  a  number  of  times  since  1978  to  implement  Article 
XIIIA. Under current law, local agencies are no longer permitted to levy directly any property tax (except 
to  pay  voter-approved  indebtedness).  The  1%  property  tax  is  automatically  levied  by  the  county  and 
distributed  according  to  a  formula  among  taxing  agencies.  The  formula  apportions  the  tax  roughly  in 
proportion to the relative shares of taxes levied prior to 1979. 

 
That portion of annual property tax revenues generated by increases in assessed valuations within 
each tax rate area within a county, subject to redevelopment agency, if any, claims on tax increment and 
subject to changes in organizations, if any, of affected jurisdictions, is allocated to each jurisdiction within 
the tax rate area in the same proportion that the total property tax revenue from the tax rate area for the 
prior year was allocated to such jurisdictions. 

 
Increases of assessed valuation resulting from reappraisals of property due to new construction, 
change  in  ownership  or  from  the  annual  adjustment  not  to  exceed  2%  are  allocated  among  the  various 
jurisdictions in the “taxing area” based upon their respective “situs.” Any such allocation made to a local 
agency continues as part of its allocation in future years. 

  
Beginning in fiscal year 1981-82, assessors in California no longer record property values on tax 
rolls at the assessed value of 25% of market value which was expressed as $4 per $100 of assessed value. 
All taxable property is now shown at 100% of assessed value on the tax rolls. Consequently, the tax rate is 
expressed as $1 per $100 of taxable value. All taxable property value included in this Official Statement is 
shown at 100% of taxable value (unless noted differently) and all tax rates reflect the $1 per $100 of taxable 
value. 

 
Both the United States Supreme Court and the California State Supreme Court have upheld the 

general validity of Article XIIIA. 

 

Article XIIIB of the California Constitution 

 
Article  XIIIB  of  the  State  Constitution,  as  subsequently  amended  by  Propositions  98  and  111, 
respectively, limits the annual appropriations of the State and of any city, county, school district, authority 
or  other  political  subdivision  of  the  State  to  the  level  of  appropriations  of  the  particular  governmental 
entity  for  the  prior  fiscal  year,  as  adjusted  for  changes  in  the  cost  of  living  and  in  population  and  for 
transfers  in  the  financial  responsibility  for  providing  services  and  for  certain  declared  emergencies.  As 
amended, Article XIIIB defines 

 
(a) 

“change  in  the  cost  of  living”  with  respect  to  school  districts  to  mean  the  percentage 

change in California per capita income from the preceding year, and 

(b) 

“change in population” with respect to a school district to mean the percentage change in 

the average daily attendance of the school district from the preceding fiscal year. 

Appendix B 

Page 16 

 

 
For  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  after  July  1,  1990,  the  appropriations  limit  of  each  entity  of 
government will be the appropriations limit for the 1986-87 fiscal year adjusted for the changes made from 
that fiscal year pursuant to the provisions of Article XIIIB, as amended. 

 
The appropriations of an entity of local government subject to Article XIIIB limitations include 
the  proceeds  of  taxes  levied  by  or  for  that  entity  and  the  proceeds  of  certain  state  subventions  to  that 
entity. “Proceeds of taxes” include, but are not limited to, all tax revenues and the proceeds to the entity 
from (a) regulatory licenses, user charges and user fees (but only to the extent that these proceeds exceed 
the  reasonable  costs  in  providing  the  regulation,  product  or  service),  and  (b)  the  investment  of  tax 
revenues. 
 
Appropriations  subject  to  limitation  do  not  include  (a)  refunds  of  taxes,  (b)  appropriations  for 
certain  debt  service,  (c)  appropriations  required  to  comply  with  certain  mandates  of  the  courts  or  the 
federal  government,  (d)  appropriations  of  certain  special  districts,  (e)  appropriations  for  all  qualified 
capital  outlay  projects  as  defined  by  the  legislature,  (f)  appropriations  derived  from  certain  fuel  and 
vehicle taxes and (g) appropriations derived from certain taxes on tobacco products. 

 
Article XIIIB includes a requirement that all revenues received by an entity of government other 
than  the  State  in  a  fiscal  year  and  in  the  fiscal  year  immediately  following  it  in  excess  of  the  amount 
permitted to be appropriated during that fiscal year and the fiscal year immediately following it shall be 
returned by a revision of tax rates or fee schedules within the next two subsequent fiscal years. 

  
Article XIIIB also includes a requirement that 50% of all revenues received by the State in a fiscal 
year and in the fiscal year immediately following it in excess of the amount permitted to be appropriated 
during that fiscal year and the fiscal year immediately following it will be transferred and allocated to the 
State School Fund pursuant to Section 8.5 of Article XVI of the State Constitution. 

 

Unitary Property 
 

AB 454 (Chapter 921, Statutes of 1986) provides that revenues derived from most utility property 
assessed by the State Board of Equalization (“Unitary Property”), commencing with the 1988-89 fiscal 
year,  will  be  allocated  as  follows:  (1)  each  jurisdiction  will  receive  up  to  102%  of  its  prior  year  State-
assessed  revenue;  and  (2)  if  county-wide  revenues  generated  from  Unitary  Property  are  less  than  the 
previous year’s revenues or greater than 102% of the previous year’s revenues, each jurisdiction will share 
the burden of the shortfall or excess revenues by a specified formula. This provision applies to all Unitary 
Property except railroads, whose valuation will continue to be allocated to individual tax rate areas. 

 
The provisions of AB 454 do not constitute an elimination of the assessment of any State-assessed 
properties  nor  a  revision  of  the  methods  of  assessing  utilities  by  the  State  Board  of  Equalization. 
Generally, AB 454 allows valuation growth or decline of Unitary Property to be shared by all jurisdictions 
in a county. 

 

California Lottery 
 

In  the  November  1984  general  election,  the  voters  of  the  State  approved  a  Constitutional 
Amendment establishing a California State Lottery (the “State Lottery”), the net revenues (revenues less 
expenses and prizes) of which shall be used to supplement other moneys allocated to public education. 

Appendix B 

Page 17 

 

The legislation further requires that the funds shall be used for the education of pupils and students and 
cannot  be  used  for  the  acquisition  of  real  property,  the  construction  of  facilities  or  the  financing  of

Allocation of State Lottery net revenues is based upon the average daily attendance of each school 
and  community  college  district;  however,  the  exact  allocation  formula  may  vary  from  year  to  year.  In 
2013-14,  the  District  budgets  to  receive  $55,946  in  State  Lottery  aid  at  the  time  of  the  Second  Interim 
Report,  representing  less  than  1%  of  the  District’s  general  fund  revenues.  At  this  time,  the  amount  of 
additional revenues that may be generated by the State Lottery in any given year cannot be predicted. 

 

Proposition 46 
 

On June 3, 1986, California voters approved Proposition 46, which added an additional exemption 
to  the  1%  tax  limitation  imposed  by  Article  XIIIA.  Under  this  amendment  to  Article  XIIIA,  local 
governments and school and community college districts may increase the property tax rate above 1% for 
the period necessary to retire new, general obligation bonds, if two-thirds of those voting in a local election 
approve the issuance of such bonds and the money raised through the sale of the bonds is used exclusively 
to purchase or improve real property. 

 

Proposition 39 
 

On November 7, 2000, California voters approved Proposition 39, called the “Smaller Classes, 
Safer Schools and Financial Accountability Act” (the “Smaller Classes Act”) which amends Section 1 of 
Article XIIIA, Section 18 of Article XVI of the California Constitution and Section 47614 of the California 
Education Code and allows an alternative means of seeking voter approval for bonded indebtedness by 55% 
of  the  vote,  rather  than  the  two-thirds  majority  required  under  Section  18  of  Article  XVI  of  the 
Constitution.  The  55%  voter  requirement  applies  only  if  the  bond  measure  submitted  to  the  voters 
includes,  among  other  items:  (1)  a  restriction  that  the  proceeds  of  the  bonds  may  be  used  for  “the 
construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,  or  replacement  of  school  facilities,  including  the  furnishing 
and equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities,” (2) a list 
of projects to be funded and a certification that the school district board has evaluated “safety, class size 
reduction,  and  information  technology  needs  in  developing  that  list”  and  (3)  that  annual,  independent 
performance  and  financial  audits  will  be  conducted  regarding  the  expenditure  and  use  of  the  bond 
proceeds. 
 
Section 1(b)(3) of Article XIIIA has been added to exempt the 1% ad valorem tax limitation that 
Section  1(a)  of  Article  XIIIA  of  the  Constitution  levies,  to  pay  bonds  approved  by  55%  of  the  voters, 
subject to the restrictions explained above. 

 
The  Legislature  enacted  AB  1908,  Chapter  44,  which  became  effective  upon  passage  of 
Proposition 39 and amends various sections of the Education Code. Under amendments to Section 15268 
and 15270 of the Education Code, the following limits on ad valorem taxes apply in any single election: (1) 
for  an  elementary  and  high  school  district,  indebtedness  shall  not  exceed  $30  per  $100,000  of  taxable 
property,  (2)  for  a  unified  school  district,  indebtedness  shall  not  exceed  $60  per  $100,000  of  taxable 
property,  and  (3)  for  a  community  college  district,  indebtedness  shall  not  exceed  $25  per  $100,000  of 
taxable property. These requirements are not part of Proposition 39 and can be changed with a majority 
vote  of  both  houses  of  the  Legislature  and  approval  by  the  Governor.  Finally,  AB  1908  requires  that  a 

Appendix B

citizens’ oversight committee must be appointed who will review the use of the bond funds and inform the 
public about their proper usage. 

 
Alternatively,  charter  schools  are  independent  public  schools  formed  by  teachers,  parents,  and 
other  individuals  and/or  groups.  The  schools  function  under  contracts  or  “charters”  with  local  school 
districts, county boards of education, or the State Board of Trustees. They are exempt from most State 
laws  and  regulations  affecting  public  schools.  As  of  June  2000,  there  were  309  charter  schools  in 
California,  serving  about  105,000  students  (less  than  2%  of  all  K-12  students).  The  law  permits  an 
additional  100  charter  schools  each  year  until  2003,  at  which  time  the  charter  school  program  will  be 
reviewed by the Legislature. Under current law, school districts must allow charter schools to use, at no 
charge, facilities not currently used by the district for instructional or administrative purposes. 

 
Proposition  39  requires  that  each  local  K-12  school  district  provide  charter  school  facilities 
sufficient to accommodate the charter school’s students. A K-12 school district, however, would not be 
required to spend its general discretionary revenues to provide these facilities for charter schools. Instead, 
the district could choose to use these or other revenues — including State and local bonds. Such facilities 
must be reasonably equivalent to the district schools that such charter students would otherwise attend. 
The  respective  K-12  school  district  is  permitted  charge  the  charter  school  for  its  facilities  if  district 
discretionary revenues are used to fund the facilities and a district may decline to provide facilities for a 
charter school with a current or projected enrollment of fewer than 80 students. There are presently no 
charter schools within the District. 

 

Article XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution 
 

On November 5, 1996, an initiative to amend the California Constitution known as the “Right to 
Vote on Taxes Act” (“Proposition 218”) was approved by a majority of California voters. Proposition 218 
added  Articles  XIIIC  and  XIIID  to  the  State  Constitution  and  requires  majority  voter  approval  for  the 
imposition, extension or increase of general taxes and 2/3 voter approval for the imposition, extension or 
increase of special taxes by a local government, which is defined in Proposition 218 to include counties. 
Proposition 218 also provides that any general tax imposed, extended or increased without voter approval 
by any local government on or after January 1, 1995, and prior to November 6, 1996 shall continue to be 
imposed only if approved by a majority vote in an election held within two years following November 6, 
1996. All local taxes and benefit assessments which may be imposed by public agencies will be defined as 
“general taxes” (defined as those used for general governmental purposes) or “special taxes” (defined as 
taxes for a specific purpose even if the revenues flow through the local government’s general fund) both of 
which  would  require  a  popular  vote.  New  general  taxes  require  a  majority  vote  and  new  special  taxes 
require a two-thirds vote. Proposition 218 also extends the initiative power to reducing or repealing local 
taxes,  assessments,  fees  and  charges,  regardless  of  the  date  such  taxes,  assessments  or  fees  or  charges 
were imposed, and lowers the number of signatures necessary for the process. In addition, Proposition 218 
limits  the  application  of  assessments,  fees  and  charges  and  requires  them  to  be  submitted  to  property 
owners for approval or rejection, after notice and public hearing. 

 
The  District  has  no  power  to  impose  taxes  except  property  taxes  associated  with  a  general 
obligation bond election, following approval by 55% or 2/3 of the District’s voters, depending upon the 
Article of the Constitution under which it is passed. 

 
Proposition 218 also expressly extends the initiative power to give voters the power to reduce or 
repeal local taxes, assessments, fees and charges, regardless of the date such taxes, assessments, fees or 

Appendix B 

Page 19 

 

charges  were  imposed,  and  reduces  the  number  of  signatures  required  for  the  initiative  process.  This 
extension of the initiative power to some extent constitutionalizes the March 6, 1995 State Supreme Court 
decision  in  Rossi  v.  Brown,  which  upheld  an  initiative  that  repealed  a  local  tax  and  held  that  the  State 
constitution  does  not  preclude  the  repeal,  including  the  prospective  repeal,  of  a  tax  ordinance  by  an 
initiative, as contrasted with the State constitutional prohibition on referendum powers regarding statutes 
and  ordinances  which  impose  a  tax.  Generally,  the  initiative  process  enables  California  voters  to  enact 
legislation  upon  obtaining  requisite  voter  approval  at  a  general  election.  Proposition  218  extends  the 
authority  stated  in  Rossi  v.  Brown  by  expanding  the  initiative  power  to  include  reducing  or  repealing 
assessments, fees and charges, which had previously been considered administrative rather than legislative 
matters and therefore beyond the initiative power. This extension of the initiative power is not limited by 
the terms of Proposition 218 to fees imposed after November 6,1996 and absent other legal authority could 
result in retroactive reduction in any existing taxes, assessments or fees and charges. Such legal authority 
could  include  the  limitations  imposed  on  the  impairment  of  contracts  under  the  contract  clause  of  the 
United States Constitution. 

 
Proposition 218 has no effect upon the District’s ability to pursue approval of a general obligation 
bond or a Mello-Roos Community Facilities District bond in the future, although certain procedures and 
burdens  of  proof  may  be  altered  slightly.  The  District  is  unable  to  predict  the  nature  of  any  future 
challenges  to  Proposition  218  or  the  extent  to  which,  if  any,  Proposition  218  may  be  held  to  be 
unconstitutional. 

 

Propositions 98 and 111 

 
On  November  8,  1988,  voters  approved  Proposition  98,  a  combined  initiative  constitutional 
amendment and statute called the “Classroom Instructional Improvement and Accountability Act” (the 
“Accountability  Act”).  Certain  provisions  of  the  Accountability  Act  have,  however,  been  modified  by 
Proposition  111,  discussed  below,  the  provisions  of  which  became  effective  on  July  1,  1990.  The 
Accountability Act changes State funding of public education below the university level and the operation 
of  the  State’s  appropriations  limit.  The  Accountability  Act  guarantees  State  funding  for  K-12  school 
districts and community college districts (hereinafter referred to collectively as “K-14 school districts”) at 
a  level  equal  to  the  greater  of  (a)  the  same  percentage  of  general  fund  revenues  as  the  percentage 
appropriated to such districts in 1986-87, and (b) the amount actually appropriated to such districts from 
the general fund in the previous fiscal year, adjusted for increases in enrollment and changes in the cost of 
living. The Accountability Act permits the Legislature to suspend this formula for a one-year period. 

 
Since  the  Accountability  Act  is  unclear  in  some  details,  there  can  be  no  assurances  that  the 
Legislature  or  a  court  might  not  interpret  the  Accountability  Act  to  require  a  different  percentage  of 
general fund revenues to be allocated to K-14 school districts, or to apply the relevant percentage to the 
State’s budgets in a different way than is proposed in the Governor’s Budget. In any event, the Governor 
and other fiscal observers expect the Accountability Act to place increasing pressure on the State’s budget 
over  future  years,  potentially  reducing  resources  available  for  other  State  programs,  especially  to  the 
extent the Article XIIIB spending limit would restrain the State’s ability to fund such other programs by 
raising taxes. 

 
The Accountability Act also changes how tax revenues in excess of the State appropriations limit 
are distributed. Any excess State tax revenues up to a specified amount would, instead of being returned 
to taxpayers, be transferred to K-14 school districts. Any such transfer to K-14 school districts would be 
excluded  from  the  appropriations  limit  for  K-14  school  districts  and  the  K-14  school  district 

Appendix B 

Page 20 

 

appropriations limit for the next year would automatically be increased by the amount of such transfer. 
These additional moneys would enter the base funding calculation for K-14 school districts for subsequent 
years, creating further pressure on other portions of the State budget, particularly if revenues decline in a 
year  following  an  Article  XIIIB  surplus.  The  maximum  amount  of  excess  tax  revenues  which  could  be 
transferred to K-14 school districts is 4% of the minimum State spending for education mandated by the 
Accountability Act. 

 
On June 5, 1990, the voters approved Proposition 111 (Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 1) 
called the “Traffic Congestion Relief and Spending Limit Act of 1990” (“Proposition 111”) which further 
modified  Article  XIIIB  and  Sections  8  and  8.5  of  Article  XVI  of  the  State  Constitution  with  respect  to 
appropriations limitations and school funding priority and allocation. 

 
The most significant provisions of Proposition 111 are summarized as follows: 
 

a. 

Annual  Adjustments  to  Spending  Limit.  The  annual  adjustments  to  the  Article 
XIIIB spending limit were liberalized to be more closely linked to the rate of economic growth. 
Instead  of  being  tied  to  the  Consumer  Price  Index,  the  “change  in  the  cost  of  living”  is  now 
measured by the change in California per capita personal income. The definition of “change in 
population”  specifies  that  a  portion  of  the  State’s  spending  limit  is  to  be  adjusted  to  reflect 
changes in school attendance. 

 
b. 

Treatment  of  Excess  Tax  Revenues.  “Excess”  tax  revenues  with  respect  to 
Article XIIIB are now determined based on a two-year cycle, so that the State can avoid having to 
return to taxpayers excess tax revenues in one year if its appropriations in the next fiscal year are 
under  its  limit.  In  addition,  the  Proposition  98  provision  regarding  excess  tax  revenues  was 
modified. After any two-year period, if there are excess State tax revenues, 50% of the excess are 
to be transferred to K-14 school districts with the balance returned to taxpayers; under prior law, 
100% of excess State tax revenues went to K-14 school districts, but only up to a maximum of 4% 
of the schools’ minimum funding level. Also, reversing prior law, any excess State tax revenues 
transferred to K-14 school districts are not built into the school districts’ base expenditures for 
calculating their entitlement for State aid in the next year, and the State’s appropriations limit is 
not to be increased by this amount. 

 
c. 

Exclusions from Spending Limit. Two exceptions were added to the calculation 
of appropriations which are subject to the Article XIIIB spending limit. First, there are excluded 
all  appropriations  for  “qualified  capital  outlay  projects”  as  defined  by  the  Legislature.  Second, 
there  are  excluded  any  increases  in  gasoline  taxes  above  the  1990  level  (then  nine  cents  per 
gallon), sales and use taxes on such  increment in  gasoline taxes,  and increases in receipts from 
vehicle  weight  fees  above  the  levels  in  effect  on  January  1,  1990.  These  latter  provisions  were 
necessary to make effective the transportation funding package approved by the Legislature and 
the Governor, which expected to raise over $15 billion in additional taxes from 1990 through 2000 
to fund transportation programs. 

 
d. 

Recalculation of Appropriations Limit.  The  Article  XIIIB  appropriations  limit 
for  each  unit  of  government,  including  the  State,  is  to  be  recalculated  beginning  in  fiscal  year 
1990-91. It is based on the actual limit for fiscal year 1986-87, adjusted forward to 1990-91 as if 
Proposition 111 had been in effect.

e. 

School Funding Guarantee. 

There  is  a  complex  adjustment  in  the  formula 
enacted in Proposition 98 which guarantees K-14 school districts a certain amount of State general 
fund revenues. Under prior law, K-14 school districts were guaranteed the greater of (1) 40.9% of 
State  general  fund  revenues  (the  “first  test”)  or  (2)  the  amount  appropriated  in  the  prior  year 
adjusted for changes in the cost of living (measured as in Article XIIIB by reference to per capita 
personal income) and enrollment (the “second test”). Under Proposition 111, schools will receive 
the greater of (1) the first test, (2) the second test, or (3) a third test, which will replace the second 
test in any year when growth in per capita State general fund revenues from the prior year is less 
than the annual growth in California per capital personal income. Under the third test, schools 
will receive the amount appropriated in the prior year adjusted for change in enrollment and per 
capita State general fund revenues, plus an additional small adjustment factor. If the third test is 
used in any year, the difference between the third test and the second test will become a “credit” 
to  schools  which  will  be  paid  in  future  years  when  State  general  fund  revenue  growth  exceeds 
personal income growth. 
 

Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2006 

 
The Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2006 (“Proposition 1D”) 
appeared on the November 7, 2006 ballot as Proposition 1D and was approved by California voters. This 
measure authorized the sale and issuance of $10.4 billion in general obligation bonds for construction and 
renovation of K-12 school facilities ($7.3 billion) and higher education facilities ($3.1 billion). Proposition 
1D makes available $3.3 billion for reconstruction or modernization of existing K-12 school facilities. K-12 
school districts are required to pay for 40% of these costs with local revenues, unless qualified for hardship 
funding.  Proposition  1D  also  includes  $1.9  billion  for  acquisition  of  land  and  new  construction  of  K-12 
school facilities. K-12 school districts are required to pay for 50% of such costs with local revenues, unless 
qualified for hardship funding. Proposition 1D directs a total of $1.0 billion to K-12 school districts which 
are considered severely overcrowded, specifically to schools that have large number of pupils relative to 
the size of the school site. 

 

Proposition 30 
 

On November 6, 2012, voters of the State approved the Temporary Taxes to Fund Education, 
Guaranteed  Local  Public  Safety  Funding,  Initiative  Constitutional  Amendment  (also  known  as 
“Proposition  30”),  which  temporarily  increases  the  State  Sales  and  Use  Tax  and  personal  income  tax 
rates on higher incomes. Proposition 30 temporarily imposes an additional tax on all retailers, at the rate of 
0.25% of gross receipts from the sale of all tangible personal property sold in the State from January 1, 2013 
to December 31, 2016. Proposition 30 also imposes an additional excise tax on the storage, use, or other 
consumption in the State of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer on and after January 1, 
2013 and before January 1, 2017, for storage, use, or other consumption in the State. This excise tax will be 
levied  at  a  rate  of  0.25%  of  the  sales  price  of  the  property  so  purchased.  Beginning  in  the  taxable  year 
commencing  January  1,  2012  and  through  the  taxable  year  ending  December  31,  2018,  Proposition  30 
increases the marginal personal income tax rate by: (i) 1% for taxable income over $250,000 but less than 
$300,000 for single filers (over $340,000 but less than $408,000 for joint filers), (ii) 2% for taxable income 
over $300,000 but less than $500,000 for single filers (over $408,000 but less than $680,000 for joint 
filers), and (iii) 3% for taxable income over $500,000 for single filers (over $608,000 for joint filers). 

 
The revenues generated from the temporary tax increases will be included in the calculation of the 
Proposition  98  minimum  funding  guarantee  for  school  districts  and  community  college  districts.  See 

Appendix B 

Page 22 

 

“CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT  REVENUES 
AND  APPROPRIATIONS  –  Propositions  98  and  111”  herein.  From  an  accounting  perspective,  the 
revenues  generated  from  the  temporary  tax  increases  will  be  deposited  into  the  State  account  created 
pursuant  to  Proposition  30  called  the  Education  Protection  Account  (the  “EPA”).  Pursuant  to 
Proposition 30, funds in the EPA will be allocated quarterly, with 89% of such funds provided to schools 
districts and 11% provided to community college districts. The funds will be distributed to school districts 
and community college districts in the same manner as existing unrestricted per-student funding, except 
that no school district will receive less than $200 per unit of ADA and no community college district will 
receive less than $100 per full time equivalent student. The governing board of each school district and 
community college district is granted sole authority to determine how the moneys received from the EPA 
are  spent,  provided  that,  the  appropriate  governing  board  is  required  to  make  these  spending 
determinations in open session at a public meeting and such local governing boards are prohibited from 
using any funds from the EPA for salaries or benefits of administrators or any other administrative costs. 

 

Future Initiatives 
 

Article XIIIA, Article XIIIB, Article XIIIC, Article XIIID and Propositions 26 and 98 were each 
adopted as measures that qualified for the ballot pursuant to the State’s initiative process. From time to 
time, other initiative measures could be adopted, further affecting the District’s revenues or their ability 
to expend revenues. 

 

GENERAL SCHOOL DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

State Funding of Education; State Budget Process  

 

 

General.  As  is  true  for  all  school  districts  in  the  State,  the  District’s  operating  income  consists 
primarily of two components: a State portion funded from the State’s general fund and a locally-generated 
portion derived from the District’s share of the 1% county-wide ad valorem property tax authorized by the 
State  Constitution.  School  districts  may  be  eligible  for  other  special  categorical  funding,  including  for 
State  and  federal  programs.  Because  the  District’s  legal  minimum  funding  level  is  expected  to  be  met 
from local property taxes alone, the District did not budget receipt of any general operating funds from the 
State  in  fiscal  year  2013-14.  As  a  result,  decreases  or  deferrals  in  State  revenues,  or  in  State  legislative 
appropriations made to fund education, may affect District operations, though generally to a lesser extent 
than these may affect most school districts.  

 

State funding is guaranteed to a minimum level for school districts, community college districts, 
and  other  State  agencies  that  provide  direct  elementary  and  secondary  instructional  programs.  The 
funding  guarantee  is  known  as  “Proposition  98,”  a  constitutional  and  statutory  initiative  amendment 
adopted by the State’s voters in 1988, and amended by Proposition 111 in 1990 (now found at Article XVI, 
Sections 8 and 8.5 of the State Constitution).  

 
Recent years have seen frequent disruptions in State personal income taxes, sales and use taxes, 
and  corporate  taxes,  making  it  increasingly  difficult  for  the  State  to  meet  its  Proposition  98  funding 
mandate,  which  normally  commands  about  45%  of  all  State  general  fund  revenues,  while  providing  for 
other fixed State costs and priority programs and services. Because education funding constitutes such a 
large  part  of  the  State’s  general  fund  expenditures,  it  is  at  the  heart  of  annual  budget  negotiations  and 
adjustments.  

 

Appendix B 

Page 23 

 

Adoption of Annual State Budget. According to the State Constitution, the Governor of the State 
(the “Governor”) must propose a budget to the State Legislature no later than January 10 of each year. 
Under  an  initiative  constitutional  amendment  approved  by  the  State’s  voters  on  November  2,  2010  as 
“Proposition 25”, a final budget must be adopted by a majority vote (rather than a two-third majority, as 
was the case prior to the passage of Proposition 25) of each house of the Legislature no later than June 15, 
although this deadline has been breached in the past. Any tax increase provision of such final budget shall 
continue  to  require  approval  by  a  two-thirds  majority  vote  of  each  house  of  the  State  Legislature.  The 
budget  becomes  law  upon  the  signature  of  the  Governor,  who  may  veto  specific  items  of  expenditure. 
School district budgets must generally be adopted by July 1, and revised by the school board within 45 
days after the Governor signs the budget act to reflect any changes in budgeted revenues and expenditures 
made necessary by the adopted State budget. The Governor signed the 2013-14 Budget on June 27, 2013.  

 
When the State budget is not adopted on time, basic appropriations and the categorical funding 
portion  of  each  district’s  State  funding  are  affected  differently.  Under  the  rule  of  White  v.  Davis  (also 
referred  to  as  Jarvis  v.  Connell),  a  State  Court  of  Appeal  decision  reached  in  2002,  there  is  no 
constitutional  mandate  for  appropriations  to  school  districts  without  an  adopted  budget  or  emergency 
appropriation, and funds for State programs cannot be disbursed by the State Controller until that time 
unless the expenditure is (i) authorized by a continuing appropriation found in statute, (ii) mandated by 
the State Constitution (such as appropriations for salaries of elected state officers), or (iii) mandated by 
federal law (such as payments to State workers at no more than minimum wage). The State Controller has 
consistently stated that basic State funding for schools is continuously appropriated by statute, but that 
special and categorical funds may not be appropriated without an adopted budget. The State Controller 
has  posted  guidance  as  to  what  can  and  cannot  be  paid  during  a  budget  impasse  at  its  website: 
www.sco.ca.gov.  Should  the  Legislature  fail  to  pass  the  budget  or  emergency  appropriation  before  the 
start of any fiscal year, the District might experience delays in receiving certain expected revenues.  

 
Aggregate State Education Funding. The Proposition 98 guaranteed amount for education is based 
on  prior-year  funding,  as  adjusted  through  various  formulas  and  tests  that  take  into  account  State 
proceeds of taxes, local property tax proceeds, school enrollment, per-capita personal income, and other 
factors. The State’s share of the guaranteed amount is based on State general fund tax proceeds and is not 
based on the general fund in total or on the State budget. The local share of the guaranteed amount is 
funded from local property taxes. The total guaranteed amount varies from year to year and throughout 
the  stages  of  any  given  fiscal  year’s  budget,  from  the  Governor’s  initial  budget  proposal  to  actual 
expenditures  to  post-year-end  revisions,  as  better  information  regarding  the  various  factors  becomes 
available. Over the long run, the guaranteed amount will increase as enrollment and per capita personal 
income grow.  

 
If,  at  year-end,  the  guaranteed  amount  is  calculated  to  be  higher  than  the  amount  actually 
appropriated in that year, the difference becomes an additional education funding obligation, referred to as 
“settle-up.”  If  the  amount  appropriated  is  higher  than  the  guaranteed  amount  in  any  year,  that  higher 
funding  level  permanently  increases  the  base  guaranteed  amount  in  future  years.  The  Proposition  98 
guaranteed amount is reduced in years when general fund revenue growth lags personal income growth, 
and  may  be  suspended  for  one  year  at  a  time  by  enactment  of  an  urgency  statute.  In  either  case,  in 
subsequent years when State general fund revenues grow faster than personal income (or sooner, as the 
Legislature may determine), the funding level must be restored to the guaranteed amount, the obligation 
to do so being referred to as “maintenance factor.”  

 

Appendix B 

Page 24 

 

In  recent  years,  the  State’s  response  to  fiscal  difficulties  has  had  a  significant  impact  on 
Proposition 98 funding and settle-up treatment. The State has sought to avoid or delay paying settle-up 
amounts  when  funding  has  lagged  the  guaranteed  amount.  In  response,  teachers’  unions,  the  State 
Superintendent, and others, sued the State or Governor in 1995, 2005, and 2009, to force them to fund 
schools in the full amount required. The settlement of the 1995 and 2005 lawsuits has so far resulted in 
over  $4  billion  in  accrued  State  settle-up  obligations.  However,  legislation  enacted  to  pay  down  the 
obligations through additional education funding over time, including the Quality Education Investment 
Act  of  2006  (QEIA),  have  also  become  part  of  annual  budget  negotiations,  resulting  in  repeated 
adjustments and deferrals of the settle-up amounts.  

 
The  State  has  also  sought  to  preserve  general  fund  cash  while  avoiding  increases  in  the  base 
guaranteed  amount  through  various  mechanisms:  by  treating  any  excess  appropriations  as  advances 
against subsequent years’ Proposition 98 minimum funding levels rather than current year increases; by 
temporarily deferring apportionments of Proposition 98 funds one fiscal year to the next; by permanently 
deferring  the  year-end  apportionment  from  June  30  to  July  2;  by  suspending  Proposition  98,  and  by 
proposing  to  amend  the  State  Constitution’s  definition  of  the  guaranteed  amount  and  settle-up 
requirement under certain circumstances.

Prior  Years’  Budgeting  Techniques.  Declining  revenues  and  fiscal  difficulties  which  arose  in  the 
State  commencing  in  fiscal  year  2008-09  led  the  State  to  undertake  a  number  of  budgeting  strategies, 
which had subsequent impacts on local agencies within the State. These techniques included the issuance 
of IOUs in lieu of warrants (checks), the enactment of statutes deferring amounts owed to public schools, 

Appendix B 

Page 25 

 

until a later date in the fiscal year, or even into the following fiscal year (known as statutory deferrals), 
trigger  reductions,  which  were  budget  cutting  measures  which  were  implemented  or  could  have  been 
implemented  if  certain  State  budgeting  goals  were  not  met,  among  others,  and  the  dissolution  of  local 
redevelopment agencies in part to make available additional funding for local agencies. Although the fiscal 
year  2013-14  Budget  is  balanced  and  projects  a  balanced  budget  for  the  foreseeable  future,  largely 
attributable to the additional revenues generated due to the passage of Proposition 30 at the November 6, 
2012  statewide  election,  as  well  as  other  spending  cuts,  there  can  be  no  certainty  that  budget-cutting 
strategies such as those used in recent years will not be used in the future should the State Budget again be 
stressed and if projections included in such budget do not materialize. 

 

2013-14 State Budget 
 

On June 27, 2013, Governor Brown approved the 2013-14 Budget Act, projecting $97.1 billion in 
general fund revenues and adopting a $96.3 billion spending plan, the first balanced budget in many years. 
Temporary revenues provided by the passage of Proposition 30 (Sales and Income Tax Revenue Increase 
approved by State voters at an election held on November 6, 2012) and spending cuts made in the past 
two years mean that the State’s budget is projected to remain balanced for the foreseeable future. The 
2013-14 State Budget maintains a $1.1 billion reserve and pays down a budgetary deficit, projected to be 
reduced from $35 billion to $27 billion in 2013-14 and to below $5 billion by the end of 2016-17. 

 
The  Budget  includes  total  funding  of  $70  billion  ($39.6  billion  General  Fund  and  $30.4  billion 
other  funds)  for  all  K‐12  education  programs.  The  2013-14  State  Budget  and  its  related  implementing 
legislation enacts significant reforms to the State’s system of K-12 education finance with the enactment 
of a new LCFF funding formula. Under the LCFF, Proposition 98 funding, the State’s minimum funding 
guarantee for K-12 schools and community colleges that went into effect in fiscal year 1988-89, is $55.3 
billion in the 2013-14 fiscal year, an increase of more than $8 billion over the 2011‐12 fiscal year funding 
level.  The  2013-14  Budget  projects  Proposition  98  funding  for  K‐12  education  to  grow  by  almost  $20 
billion from the 2011‐12 fiscal year to the 2016‐17 fiscal year, representing an increase of more than $2,800 
per student during such period. 

 
Local  Control  Funding  Formula.  The  LCFF  attempts  to  move  from  an  existing  school  funding 
system characterized as overly complex and inequitable to a locally-controlled system, which responds to 
research and practical experience indicating that students from low income families and English language 
learners often require supplemental services and support to be successful in school. 

 
State  Funding  under  the  LCFF.  The  LCFF  changes  the  State  funding  system  for  school 
districts,  charter  schools  and  county  offices  of  education  by,  among  other  changes,  consolidating  most 
categorical programs with the existing revenue limit structure to provide a new student formula which will 
be  phased  in  over  seven  years,  and  implementing  supplemental  and  concentration  grants  to  English 
language  learners  and  economically  disadvantaged  students.  The  LCFF  includes  the  following 
components: 

 
• A base grant for each local education agency per unit of A.D.A of $7,675 for students in grades 
K-3, $7,056 for students in grades 4-6, $7,266 for students in grades 7-8, and $8,638 for students in grades 
9-12. These figures include a cost-of-living adjustment for 2013-14. This base grant is $2,375 more than 
the  average  revenue  limit  provided  prior  to  LCFF  implementation.  The  base  grants  will  be  adjusted 
upward each year to reflect cost-of-living increases 

 

Appendix B 

Page 26 

 

• A 20% supplemental grant for English learners, students from low-income families and foster 

youth to reflect increased costs associated with educating those students. 

 
• An additional concentration grant of up to 22.5% of a local education agency’s base grant, based 
on the number of English learners, students from low-income families and foster youth served by the local 
agency that comprise more than 55% of enrollment. 

 
• An economic recovery target to ensure that almost every local education agency receives at least 

their pre-recession funding level, adjusted for inflation, at full implementation of the LCFF. 

 
The  LCFF  was  implemented  for  fiscal  year  2013-14  and  will  be  phased  in  gradually.  Based  on 
revenue projections, districts will reach what is called “full funding” in eight years or in 2020-21. Until 
full funding is reached, each year districts will get additional funds based on A.D.A. and the percentage of 
a district’s students who are low-income, English learners, and foster youth. This projection assumes that 
the  State’s  economy  will  improve  each  year;  if  the  economy  falters  it  could  take  longer  to  reach  full 
funding. 
 
Accountability under the LCFF. The LCFF moves from a state‐controlled system that emphasized 
inputs (largely in the form of categorical funding which required funds to be spent on specific projects and 
programs)  to  a  locally‐controlled  system  in  which  local  agencies  decide  the  best  way  to  spend  funds, 
focused  instead  on  improved  outcomes.  However,  districts  will  be  required  to  increase  or  improve 
services  for  English  language  learners,  low  income,  and  foster  youth  students  in  proportion  to 
supplemental and concentration grant funding received. All school districts, county offices of education, 
and charter schools will be required to develop and adopt local control and accountability plans, which will 
identify  local  goals  in  areas  that  are  priorities  for  the  State,  including  pupil  achievement,  parent 
engagement, and school climate. 

 
County superintendents will review and provide support to the districts under their jurisdiction, 
and  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  will  perform  a  corresponding  role  for  county  offices  of 
education. In addition, the 2013-14 Budget creates the California Collaborative for Education Excellence 
to advise and assist school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools in achieving the goals 
identified in their plans. 

 
The State will continue to measure student achievement through statewide assessments, produce 
an  Academic  Performance  Index  for  schools  and  subgroups  of  students,  determine  the  contents  of  the 
school accountability report card, and establish policies to implement the federal accountability system. 

 
Other K-12 Budget Adjustments. In addition to the first year funding provided under the LCFF, the 

2013-14 State Budget includes: 

 
• Common Core Implementation Funding. An increase of $1.25 billion in one-time Proposition 
98 funding to support the implementation of the Common Core – new standards for evaluating student 
achievement in English-language arts and math. Funding will be distributed on the basis of enrollment for 
professional development, instructional materials and technology. Local agencies must develop a plan on 
how to spend these funds over the next two years, and hold a public hearing on such plan. 

 

Appendix B 

Page 27 

 

• Career Technical Education Pathways Grant Program. $250 million for one-time competitive 
capacity  building  grants  for  K-12  and  community  colleges  to  support  programs  based  on  work-based 
learning. 
 
•  K-12  Mandates  Block  Grant.  $50  million  to  reflect  the  inclusion  of  graduation  requirements 
mandate within the block grant program, which will be distributed to school districts, county offices of 
education and charter schools with enrollment in grades 9-12. 

 
•  K-12  Budget  Deferral  Repayment.  An  increase  of  $1.6  billion  in  2012-13  and  an  increase  of 

$242.3 million in 2013-14 for the repayment of inter-year budgetary deferrals. 

 
•  Proposition  39  (Energy  Efficiency  Projects)  Implementation.  $381  million  in  Proposition  98 
funding is allocated to support energy efficiency projects approved by the California Energy Commission. 
Of this amount, 85 percent will be allocated based on A.D.A and 15 percent will be allocated based on free 
and reduced price meal eligibility. 

 
• Special Education Funding Reform. Consolidations for various special education programs to 

simplify special education finance and provide additional funding flexibility. 

 
Higher  Education  and  Health  Care.  The  2013-14  State  Budget  increases  funding  for  higher 
education by between $1,649 and $2,491 per student through 2016-17. The 2013-14 State Budget provides 
funding to expand Medi-Cal to approximately 1.4 million Californians pursuant to the federal law known 
as the Affordable Care Act. The State anticipates that this will significantly increase health care coverage, 
improve access to mental health services, expand substance use disorder treatment and take advantage of 
new federal dollars. 

 
Numerous Factors Affecting Budget and Projections. The execution of the 2013-14 State Budget may 
be  affected  by  numerous  factors,  including  but  not  limited  to:  (i)  shifts  of  costs  from  the  federal 
government  to  the  State,  (ii)  national,  State  and  international  economic  conditions,  (iii)  litigation  risk 
associated  with  spending  reductions,  including  the  elimination  of  redevelopment  agencies,  (iv)  rising 
health care costs (v) large unfunded liabilities for retired State employee’s pensions and healthcare, (vi) 
deferred  maintenance  of  State’s  critical  infrastructure  and  (vii)  other  factors,  all  or  any  of  which  could 
cause the revenue and spending projections made in 2013-14 State Budget to be unattainable. The District 
cannot  predict  the  impact  that  the  2013-14  State  Budget,  or  subsequent  budgets,  will  have  on  its  own 
finances and operations. Additionally, the District cannot predict the accuracy of any projections made in 
the State’s 2013-14 State Budget. 

 
The  complete  2013-14  State  Budget  is  available  from  the  California  Department  of  Finance 
website  at  www.dof.ca.gov.  The  District  can  take  no  responsibility  for  the  continued  accuracy  of  this 
internet  address  or  for  the  accuracy,  completeness  or  timeliness  of  information  posted  there,  and  such 
information is not incorporated in this Official Statement by such reference. The information referred to 
above should not be relied upon in making an investment decision with respect to the Certificates. 

 

2014-15 State Budget 
 

On June 20, 2014, Governor Brown approved the 2014-15 Budget Act (the “2014-15 Budget”), 
projecting $108 billion in general fund revenues, which is $7.3 million more in general fund revenues than 
in fiscal year 2013-14. The 2014-15 Budget is balanced and projects paying down more than $10 billion in 

Appendix B 

Page 28 

 

unprecedented amounts of budgetary debt from past years, including paying down deferral of payments to 
schools  by  $5  billion,  paying  off  Economic  Recovery  Bonds,  repaying  various  special  fund  loans,  and 
funding  $100  million  in  mandate  claims  that  have  been  owed  to  local  governments  since  2004.  The 
budgetary  deficit  is  projected  to  be  reduced  to  below  $5  billion  by  the  end  of  2016-17.  The  fiscal  year 
begins  with  a  2014-15  State  Budget  reserve  of  $2  billion  dollars,  including  $1.6  billion  in  the  State’s 
Budget Stabilization Account, also known as the State’s rainy day fund. Temporary revenues provided by 
the passage of Proposition 30 (Sales and Income Tax Revenue Increase approved by State voters at an 
election held on November 8, 2011) and spending cuts have allowed for continued economic growth in the 
State. The 2014-15 State Budget also contains triggers allowing for additional spending, if various revenue 
benchmarks are exceeded. If revenues surpass certain estimates, then the Budget calls for more funds to 
be  applied  to  higher  education  and  to  pay  down  debt.  Certain  highlights  of  the  2014-15  Budget  are 
described below. 

 
Plan  for  Reducing  STRS  Unfunded  Liability.  The  California  State  Teachers’  Retirement  System 
(“STRS”)  has  significant  unfunded  liability.  Without  changes  to  how  the  system  is  funded,  STRS  is 
expected to run out of money in about 33 years. To prevent this, the 2014-15 Budget sets forth a plan that 
shares  responsibility  among  the  school  districts,  the  state,  and  teachers  to  better  fund  STRS. 
Contributions for the first year from all three of these sources will total $275 million. Contributions will 
increase in subsequent years, reaching more than $5 billion annually. This plan is projected to eliminate 
unfunded liability by 2046. 

 
 Constitutional Amendment on November, 2014 Ballot: Rainy Day Fund. The 2014- 15 State Budget 
includes  a  proposed  constitutional  amendment  which  will  be  placed  before  State  voters  in  November, 
2014.  The  measure,  upon  approval,  would  alter  the  State’s  existing  requirements  for  the  Budget 
Stabilization Account, the State’s existing rainy day account. If approved, this amendment would: 

 
• Require deposits into the Rainy Day Fund whenever capital gains revenues rise to more than 8 
percent  of  General  Fund  tax  revenues,  and  would  set  the  maximum  size  of  the  Rainy  Day  Fund  at  10 
percent of the General Fund revenues. 

 
• Require half of each year’s deposit for the next 15 years be used for supplemental payments of 

debt or other long-term liabilities. 

 
• Allow for withdrawal of funds only for a disaster or if spending remains at or below the highest 
level of spending from the past three years. The maximum amount that could be withdrawn in the first 
year of a recession would be limited to half of the Rainy Day Fund’s balance. 

 
•  Require  that  the  state  provide  a  multiyear  budget  forecast  to  better  manage  the  state’s  long-

term finances. 

 
•  Create  a  Proposition  98  reserve,  known  as  the  Public  School  System  Stabilization  Account, 
where spikes in funding would be saved for future years. This is intended to smooth school spending and 
minimize future cuts to education funding.  

 
The  Education  Budget  Trailer  Bill  (SB  858)  amends  Education  Code  section  42127  to  provide 
that,  beginning  in  2015-16,  if  a  district’s  proposed  budget  includes  a  local  reserve  above  the  minimum 
recommended level, its governing board must provide the following information for review at the annual 
public hearing on its proposed budget:  

Appendix B 

Page 29 

 

 
The minimum recommended reserve adopted by the State Board of Education;  
The district’s fund balance in excess of the recommended reserve; and 
A statement substantiating the need for the excess reserve level. 
 
This  information  is  to  be  included  in  a  district’s  budgetary  submission  to  its  county 
superintendent,  and  the  county  superintendent  must  verify  that  each  district  has  complied  with  these 
requirements.  Budgets  prepared  by  county  superintendents  must  also  comply  with  the  above 
requirements.  This  provision  is  not  contingent  on  the  voters  approving  the  “rainy  day  fund”  in 
November,  discussed  in  the  following  sentence.  If  approved  in  November,  additional  legislation  will 
become effective which could limit the amount school districts may maintain in reserves. Specifically, the 
legislation provides that this bill would, in a fiscal year immediately after which a transfer is made into the 
Public  School  System  Stabilization  Account,  which  would  be  created  by  an  Assembly  Constitutional 
Amendment, prohibit a school district’s adopted or revised budget from containing a combined assigned 
or  unassigned  ending  fund  balance  that  is  in  excess  of  either  two  or  three  times  the  minimum 
recommended  reserve  for  economic  uncertainties,  as  established  by  the  state  board,  depending  on  the 
school district’s units of average daily attendance. The bill would authorize the county superintendent of 
schools to waive the prohibition, pursuant to specified conditions, for up to two consecutive fiscal years 
within a three-year period if the school district provides documentation indicating that extraordinary fiscal 
circumstances substantiates the need for the balance. The bill would make operation of these provisions 
contingent on the voter approval of a specified Assembly Constitutional Amendment at the November 4, 
2014, statewide general election. 

 
K-12 Budget Adjustments. The 2014-15 State Budget includes total funding of $76.6 billion ($45.3 
billion General Fund and $31.3 billion other funds) for all K-12 education programs. Prop. 98 funding has 
contributed $10 billion to the total funding amount and the 2014-15 State Budget provides $1,954 more 
per K-12 student in 2014-15 than was provided in 2011-12. The 2014-15 State Budget also provides $4.7 
billion  for  the  second  year  of  implementing  the  LCFF  and  continues  to  commit  most  new  funding  to 
districts serving English language learners, students from low-income families, and youth in foster care. 
The Education Budget Trailer Bill (“SB 858”) is included in the 2014-15 State Budget and contains two 
separate provisions that have the potential to affect district reserve funds. In addition, the 2014-15 State 
Budget includes the following: 

 
•  Local  Control  Funding  Formula.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  contains  an  increase  of  $4.75 
billion in the Proposition 98 General Fund to continue the State’s transition to the LCFF. This increase 
will close the remaining funding implementation gap by more than 29 percent. Additionally, the 2014-15 
State Budget addresses an administrative problem related to the collection of income eligibility forms that 
are used to determine student eligibility for free or reduced price meals. 

 
•  K-12  Deferrals.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  repays  nearly  $4.7  billion  Proposition  98  General 
Fund for K-12 expenses that had been deferred from one year to the next during the past few years. This 
repayment will leave an outstanding balance of less than $900 million in K-12 deferrals. The 2014-15 State 
Budget  also  contains  a  trigger  mechanism  that  will  appropriate  any  additional  funding  resources 
attributable  to  the  2013-14  and  2014-15  fiscal  years  subsequent  to  the  enactment  of  the  2014-15  State 
Budget for the purpose of retiring the remaining $900 million in K-12 deferrals. 

 

Appendix B 

Page 30 

 

•  Independent  Study.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  reduces  administrative  burdens  and  frees  up 
time for teachers to spend on student instruction and support, making it easier for schools to offer and 
expand instructional opportunities available to students through non-classroom based instruction.  

 
• K-12 Mandates. The 2014-15 State Budget provides $400.5 million in one-time Proposition 98 
General  Fund  to  reimburse  K-12  local  educational  agencies  for  the  costs  of  state-mandated  programs. 
These funds will make a significant down payment on outstanding mandate debt, while providing school 
districts, county offices of education, and charter schools with discretionary resources to support critical 
investments such as Common Core implementation.  

 
•  K-12  High-Speed  Internet  Access.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  increases  the  onetime 
Proposition  98  General  Fund  for  the  K-12  High  Speed  Network  by  $26.7  million.  This  Fund  provides 
technical  assistance  and  grants  to  local  educational  agencies  to  address  the  technology  requirements 
necessary for Common Core implementation. 

 
• Career Technical Education Pathways Program. The 2014-15 State Budget increases by $250 
million the one-time Proposition 98 General Fund to support a second cohort of competitive grants for 
participating K-12 local educational agencies. Established in the 2013 Budget Act, the Career Pathways 
Trust  Program  provides  grant  awards  to  improve  career  technical  programs  and  linkages  between 
employers, schools and community colleges. 

 
Higher Education and Healthcare. The 2014-15 State Budget includes total funding of $26.2 billion 
($14.7 billion General Fund and local property tax and $11.5 billion other funds). It also provides for up to 
a  20  percent  increase  in  General  Fund  appropriations  over  a  four-year  period.  The  2014-15  Budget 
includes  a  5  percent  increase  in  2014-15  for  each  university  system,  which  equals  $284  million  total. 
Regarding healthcare, the state’s adoption of the optional expansion of Medi-Cal under federal law known 
as the Affordable Care Act created major new spending commitments. The 2014-15 Budget assumes an 
additional Medi-Cal caseload of 2.5 million individuals and a rise in costs of $2.4 billion over fiscal year 
2012-13. 
 
Emergency  Drought  Response.  On  January  17,  2014,  Governor  Brown  proclaimed  a  state  of 
emergency due to the severe drought conditions faced by the state. Legislation was enacted in February 
which provided $687.4 million to support drought relief. The 2014-15 Budget includes additional one-time 
resources  to  continue  immediate  drought-related  efforts  started  in  2014,  such  as  an  increase  of  $53.8 
million  General  Fund  and  $12.2  million  other  funds  for  firefighting  efforts,  and  an  increase  of  $18.1 
million  General  Fund  to  aid  in  assessing  water  conditions  and  provide  public  outreach  regarding  water 
conservation. 

 
Numerous Factors Affecting Budget and Projections. The execution of the 2014-15 State Budget may 
be  affected  by  numerous  factors,  including  but  not  limited  to:  (i)  shifts  of  costs  from  the  federal 
government  to  the  State,  (ii)  national,  State  and  international  economic  conditions,  (iii)  litigation  risk 
associated  with  spending  reductions,  including  the  elimination  of  redevelopment  agencies,  (iv)  rising 
health care costs (v) large unfunded liabilities for retired State employee’s pensions and healthcare, (vi) 
deferred  maintenance  of  State’s  critical  infrastructure  and  (vii)  other  factors,  all  or  any  of  which  could 
cause the revenue and spending projections made in 2014-15 State Budget to be unattainable. The District 
cannot  predict  the  impact  that  the  2014-15  State  Budget,  or  subsequent  budgets,  will  have  on  its  own 
finances and operations. Additionally, the District cannot predict the accuracy of any projections made in 
the State’s 2014-15 State Budget.

Uncertainty Regarding Future State Budgets. The District cannot predict what actions will be taken 
in future years by the State Legislature and the Governor to address the State’s current or future budget 
deficits. Future State budgets will be affected by national and state economic conditions and other factors 
over  which  the  District  has  no  control.  The  District  cannot  predict  what  impact  any  future  budget 
proposals will have on the financial condition of the District. To the extent that the State budget process 
results  in  reduced  revenues  to  the  District,  the  District  will  be  required  to  make  adjustments  to  its 
budgets. 
 
The State has not entered into any contractual commitment with the District, the County, or the

State Cash Management Legislation. On March 1, 2010, the Governor signed a bill (and on March 
4, 2010, subsequently signed a clean-up bill to clarify certain provisions of such bill) to provide additional 
cash  management  flexibility  to  State  fiscal  officials  (the  “Cash  Management  Bill”).  The  Cash 
Management Bill authorized deferral of certain payments during the 2010-11 fiscal year for school districts 
(not to exceed $2.5 billion in the aggregate at any one time, and a maximum of three deferrals during the 
fiscal  year).  The  Cash  Management  Bill  permitted  deferrals  of  payments  to  K-12  schools  in  July  2010, 
October 2010 and March 2011, for not to exceed 60, 90 and 30 days, respectively, but depending on actual 
cash flow conditions at the time, and allowed the Controller, Treasurer and Director of Finance to either 
accelerate or delay the deferrals up to 30 days or reduce the amounts deferred. The Cash Management 
Bill also permitted the State to move a deferral to the prior month or to a subsequent month upon 30 days 
written notice by the State Department of Finance to the Legislative Budget Committee, except that the 
Cash Management Bill provided that the deferral for March 2011 was required to be paid prior to April 30. 
The  Cash  Management  Bill  provided  for  exceptions  to  the  deferrals  for  school  districts  that  could 
demonstrate hardship. The Cash Management Bill made it necessary for many school districts (and other 
affected local agencies) to increase the size and/or frequency of their cash flow borrowings during fiscal 
year 2010-11. Similar legislation was enacted for fiscal year 2011-12. The legislation, however, sets forth a 
specific deferral plan for K-12 education payments. In the legislation, the July 2011 and August 2011 K-12 
payments of $1.4 billion and the October 2011 payment of $2.4 billion were deferred. In September 2011, 
$700 million of the July deferral was paid, in January 2012, $4.5 billion from the remaining July, August 
and October deferrals was paid, and in March 2012, $1.4 billion was deferred and paid in April 2012.  

 
The  State  Legislature  enacted  similar  legislation  for  fiscal  year  2012-13  that  provided  for  $1.2 
billion of K 12 payments to be deferred in July 2012, $600 million to be deferred in August 2012, $800 
million to be deferred in October 2012 and $900 million to be deferred in March 2013. Of such deferred 
amounts, $700 million of the deferral made in July 2012 was paid in September 2012, the remaining $1.9 
billion  deferred  in  July,  August  and  October  of  2012  was  paid  in  January  2013,  and  the  $900  million 
deferred in March 2013 was repaid in April 2013. The District is authorized to borrow temporary funds to 

Appendix B 

Page 32 

 

cover its annual cash flow deficits and, as a result of this or similar future legislation, the District might 
find  it  necessary  to  utilize  cash  flow  borrowings  or  increase  the  size  or  frequency  of  its  cash  flow 
borrowings in fiscal year 2012-13 and in future years. In future fiscal years, if the District finds that its 
other funds are insufficient to cover any cash flow deficits, the District is authorized to borrow funds from 
the County.  

 
The District cannot predict when, if, and to what extent the State may defer some or all of those 

payments due to school districts during the 2013-14 fiscal year.  

 
Future Budgets and Budgetary Actions. The District cannot predict what actions will be taken in the 
future by the State Legislature and the Governor to address changing State revenues and expenditures or 
the impact such actions will have on State revenues available in the current or future years for education. 
The State budget will be affected by national and State economic conditions and other factors over which 
the District will have no control. Certain actions could result in a significant shortfall of revenue and cash, 
and could impair the State’s ability to fund schools during fiscal year 2013-14 and in future fiscal years. 
Continued  State  budget  shortfalls  in  fiscal  year  2013-14  and  future  fiscal  years  could  have  a  material 
adverse financial impact on the District. However, the Bonds are secured by ad valorem taxes levied and 
collected on taxable property within the District, without limit as to rate or amount, and are not secured 
by a pledge of revenues of the District or its general fund.  

 
Prohibitions on Diverting Local Revenues for State Purposes. Beginning in 1992-93, the State satisfied 
a portion of its Proposition 98 obligations by shifting part of the property tax revenues otherwise belonging 
to cities, counties, special districts, and redevelopment agencies, to school and college districts through a 
local  Educational  Revenue  Augmentation  Fund  (ERAF)  in  each  county.  Local  agencies,  objecting  to 
invasions of their local revenues by the State, sponsored a statewide ballot initiative intended to eliminate 
the practice. In response, the State Legislature proposed an amendment to the State Constitution, which 
the  State’s  voters  approved  as  Proposition  1A  at  the  November  2004  election.  That  measure  was 
generally superseded by the passage of a new initiative constitutional amendment at the November 2010 
election, known as “Proposition 22.”  

 
The effect of Proposition 22 is to prohibit the State, even during a period of severe fiscal hardship, 
from  delaying  the  distribution  of  tax  revenues  for  transportation,  redevelopment,  or  local  government 
projects and services. It prevents the State from redirecting redevelopment agency property tax increment 
to any other local government, including school districts, or from temporarily shifting property taxes from 
cities, counties and special districts to schools, as in the ERAF program. This is intended to, among other 
things, stabilize local government revenue sources by restricting the State’s control over local property 
taxes. One effect of this amendment will be to deprive the State of fuel tax revenues to pay debt service on 
most  State  bonds  for  transportation  projects,  reducing  the  amount  of  State  general  fund  resources 
available for other purposes, including education. 

 
Prior to the passage of Proposition 22, the State invoked Proposition 1A to divert $1.935 billion in 
local  property  tax  revenues  in  2009-10  from  cities,  counties,  and  special  districts  to  the  State  to  offset 
State  general  fund  spending  for  education  and  other  programs,  and  included  another  diversion  in  the 
adopted  2009-10  State  budget  of  $1.7  billion  in  local  property  tax  revenues  from  local  redevelopment 
agencies,  which  local  redevelopment  agencies  have  now  been  dissolved.  Redevelopment  agencies  had 
sued  the  State  over  this  latter  diversion.  However,  the  lawsuit  was  decided  against  the  California 
Redevelopment Association on May 1, 2010. Because Proposition 22 reduces the State’s authority to use 
or shift certain revenue sources, fees and taxes for State general fund purposes, the State will have to take 

Appendix B 

Page 33 

 

other  actions  to  balance  its  budget  in  some  years—such  as  reducing  State  spending  or  increasing  State 
taxes, and school and community college districts that receive Proposition 98 or other funding from the 
State will be more directly dependent upon the State’s general fund.  

Supplemental Information Concerning Litigation Against the State of California 
 

 

In  June  1998,  a  complaint  was  filed  in  Los  Angeles  County  Superior  Court  challenging  the 
authority of the State Controller to make payments in the absence of a final, approved State Budget. The 
Superior  Court  judge  issued  a  preliminary  injunction  preventing  the  State  Controller  from  making 
payments  including  those  made  pursuant  to  continuing  appropriations  prior  to  the  enactment  of  the 
State’s annual budget. As permitted by the State Constitution, the Legislature immediately enacted and 
the Governor signed an emergency appropriations bill that allowed continued payment of various State 
obligations,  including  debt  service,  and  the  injunction  was  stayed  by  the  California  Court  of  Appeal, 
pending its decision. 

 
On  May  29,  2003,  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  for  the  Second  District  decided  the  case  of 
Steven  White,  et  al.  v.  Gray  Davis  (as  Governor  of  the  State  of  California),  et  al.  The  Court  of  Appeal 
concluded that, absent an emergency appropriation, the State Controller may authorize the payment of 
state  funds  during  a  budget  impasse  only  when  payment  is  either  (i)  authorized  by  a  “continuing 
appropriation” enacted by the Legislature, (ii) authorized by a self-executing provision of the California 
Constitution,  or  (iii)  mandated  by  federal  law.  The  Court  of  Appeal  specifically  concluded  that  the 
provisions of Article XVI, Section 8 of the California Constitution – the provision establishing minimum 
funding  of  K-14  education  enacted  as  part  of  Proposition  98  –  did  not  constitute  a  self-executing 
authorization to disburse funds, stating that such provisions merely provide formulas for determining the 
minimum  funding  to  be  appropriated  every  budget  year  but  do  not  appropriate  funds.  The  State 
Controller has concluded that the provisions of the Education Code establishing K-12 and county office 
revenue limit funding do constitute continuing appropriations enacted by the Legislature and, therefore, 
the State Controller has indicated that State payments of such amounts would continue during a budget 
impasse.  However,  no  similar  continuing  appropriation  has  been  cited  with  respect  to  K-12  categorical 
programs  and  revenue  limit  funding  for  community  college  districts,  and  the  State  Controller  has 
concluded that such payments are not authorized pursuant to a continuing appropriation enacted by the 
Legislature  and,  therefore,  cannot  be  paid  during  a  budget  impasse.  The  California  Supreme  Court 
granted  the  State  Controller’s  Petition  for  Review  on  a  procedural  issue  unrelated  to  continuous 
appropriations  and  on  the  substantive  question  as  to  whether  the  State  Controller  is  authorized  to  pay 
State employees their full and regular salaries during a budget impasse. No other aspect of the Court of 
Appeal’s decision was addressed by the State Supreme Court. 

 
On  May  1,  2003,  with  respect  to  the  substantive  question,  the  California  Supreme  Court 
concluded  that  the  State  Controller  is  required,  notwithstanding  a  budget  impasse  and  the  limitations 
imposed  by  State  law,  to  timely  pay  those  state  employees  who  are  subject  to  the  minimum  wage  and 
overtime  compensation  provisions  of  the  federal  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act.  The  Supreme  Court  also 
remanded  the  preliminary  injunction  issue  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  with  instructions  to  set  aside  the 
preliminary injunction in its entirety. 

 

State Funding of School Construction 
 

The  State  makes  funding  for  school  facility  construction  and  modernization  available  to  K-12 
districts throughout the State through the Office of Public School Construction (“OPSC”) and the State 

Appendix B 

Page 34 

 

Allocation Board (“SAB”), from proceeds of State general obligation bonds authorized and issued for this 
purpose. Such bonds were authorized in the amount of $13.05 billion, $11.40 billion of which were for K-
12 school facilities and $1.65 billion of which were for higher education facilities, on November 5, 2002 
under Proposition 47, passed by 58.9% of the State-wide vote. An additional bond measure for education 
capital projects was approved on March 2, 2006 under Proposition 55, passed by 50.6% of the State-wide 
vote, in an authorization amount of $12.3 billion, $10.0 billion of which is for K-12 school facilities and 
$2.3  billion  of  which  is  for  higher  education  facilities.  A  State  general  obligation  bond  measure  that 
includes $7.329 billion for construction, modernization and related purposes for K-12 school districts was 
approved by a majority of voters in the November 7, 2006 State-wide election. 

 
The  SAB  allocates  bond  funds  for  50%  of  approved  new  construction  costs,  60%  of  approved 
modernization costs (80% for modernization project applications made prior to February 1, 2002), or up to 
100% of approved costs of any type if the school district is approved for “hardship” funding. The school 
district is responsible for the portion of costs not funded by the State, commonly funding their portion 
with their own general obligation bonds, certificates of participation or accumulated builder’s fee revenue. 
School districts routinely apply for such funding whenever they have projects they believe meet OPSC 
and SAB criteria for funding. 
 
Proposition 26 
 

On  November  2,  2010,  voters  in  the  State  approved  Proposition  26.  Proposition  26  amends 
Article XIIIC of the State Constitution to expand the definition of “tax” to include “any levy, charge, or 
exaction  of  any  kind  imposed  by  a  local  government”  except  the  following:  (1)  a  charge  imposed  for  a 
specific  benefit  conferred  or  privilege  granted  directly  to  the  payor  that  is  not  provided  to  those  not 
charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit 
or  granting  the  privilege;  (2)  a  charge  imposed  for  a  specific  government  service  or  product  provided 
directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable 
costs to the local government of providing the service or product; (3) a charge imposed for the reasonable 
regulatory  costs  to  a  local  government  for  issuing  licenses  and  permits,  performing  investigations, 
inspections, and audits, enforcing agricultural marketing orders, and the administrative enforcement and 
adjudication  thereof;  (4)  a  charge  imposed  for  entrance  to  or  use  of  local  government  property,  or  the 
purchase,  rental,  or  lease  of  local  government  property;  (5)  A  fine,  penalty,  or  other  monetary  charge 
imposed by the judicial branch of government or a local government, as a result of a violation of law; (6) a 
charge  imposed  as  a  condition  of  property  development;  and  (7)  assessments  and  property-related  fees 
imposed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article  XIIID.  Proposition  26  provides  that  the  local 
government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy, charge, or other 
exaction  is  not  a  tax,  that  the  amount  is  no  more  than  necessary  to  cover  the  reasonable  costs  of  the 
governmental  activity,  and  that  the  manner  in  which  those  costs  are  allocated  to  a  payor  bear  a  fair  or 
reasonable relationship to the payor’s burdens on, or benefits received from, the governmental activity.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

Governing Board
Sunnyvale School District
Sunnyvale, California

Report on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the
aggregate remaining fund information of the Sunnyvale School District (the District) as of and for the year ended
June 30, 2013, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's basic
financial statements as listed in the table of contents.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;
this includes the design,
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States; and Standards and Procedures for Audits of California K-12 Local Education Agencies
2012-2013, issued by the California Education Audit Appeals Panel as regulations. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the District's preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinions.

2

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective
financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information
of the District, as of June 30, 2013, and the respective changes in financial position thereof for the year then ended
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Other Matters

Required Supplementary Information

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the required supplementary
information, as listed in the table on contents, be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such
information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting
Standards Board who considers it an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements
in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and
comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial
statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not
express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us
with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Other Information

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively
comprise the District's basic financial statements. The accompanying supplementary information, as listed in the
table of contents, including the schedule of expenditures of federal awards as required by Office of Management
and Budget Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations, are presented for
purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.

The supplementary information, as listed in the table of contents, is the responsibility of management and was
derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic
financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the
basic financial statements and certain additional procedures,
including comparing and reconciling such
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements
or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the supplementary information is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

The supplementary information has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it.

3

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 9, 2013, on
our consideration of the District's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with
certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that
report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.
That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in
considering the District's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

SUNNYVALE SCHOOL DISTRICT

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
JUNE 30, 2013

This section of the Sunnyvale School District’s annual financial report presents our discussion and analysis of the
District’s financial performance during the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2013. Please read it in conjunction
with the District’s financial statements, which immediately follow this section.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Financial Statements

The financial statements presented herein include all of the activities of the Sunnyvale School District (the
District) and its component units using the integrated approach as prescribed by GASB Statement Number 34.

The Government-Wide Financial Statements present the financial picture of the District from the economic
resources measurement focus using the accrual basis of accounting. These statements include all assets of the
District (including infrastructure) as well as all liabilities (including long-term obligations). Additionally, certain
eliminations have occurred as prescribed by the statement in regards to inter-fund activity, payables and
receivables.

The Fund Financial Statements present Governmental activities, such as regular and special education,
transportation and administration. Property taxes and State formula aid finance most of these activities.
The Fund Financial Statements provide a more detailed picture of District’s operations than government-wide
statements.

The Governmental Activities are prepared using the current financial resources measurement focus and modified
accrual basis of accounting.

Reconciliation of the Fund Financial Statements to the Government-Wide Financial Statements is provided to
explain the differences created by the integrated approach.

The primary unit of the government is the Sunnyvale School District.

REPORTING THE DISTRICT AS A WHOLE

The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities

The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities report information about the District as a whole and
about its activities. These statements include all assets and liabilities of the District using the accrual basis of
accounting, which is similar to the accounting used by most private-sector companies. All of the current year’s
revenues and expenses are taken into account regardless of when cash is received or paid.

These two statements report the District’s net position and changes in them. Net position is the difference between
assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, which is one way to
measure the District’s financial health, or financial position. Over time, increases or decreases in the District’s net
position will serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the District is improving or
deteriorating. Other factors to consider are changes in the District’s property tax base and the condition of the
District’s facilities.

SUNNYVALE SCHOOL DISTRICT

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
JUNE 30, 2013

The relationship between revenues and expenses is the District’s operating results. Since the Board’s
responsibility is to provide services to students and not to generate profit as commercial entities do, one must
consider other factors when evaluating the overall health of the District. The quality of the education and the
safety of our schools are important components in this evaluation.

The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities are derived from the District’s governmental
activities.

Governmental Activities - All of the District’s services are reported in this category. This includes the education
of kindergarten through grade eight students, the operation of child development activities, and the on-going
effort to improve and maintain buildings and sites. Property taxes, state income taxes, user fees, interest income,
federal, state and local grants, as well as general obligation bonds, finance these activities.

REPORTING THE DISTRICT’S MOST SIGNIFICANT FUNDS

Fund Financial Statements

The fund financial statements provide detailed information about the most significant funds - not the District as a
whole. Some funds are required to be established by State law and by bond covenants. However, management
establishes many other funds to help it control and manage money for particular purposes or to show that it is
meeting legal responsibilities for using certain taxes, grants, and other money that it receives from the U.S.
Department of Education.

Governmental funds - Most of the District’s basic services are reported in governmental funds, which focus on
how money flows into and out of those funds and the balances left at year-end that are available for spending.
These funds are reported using an accounting method called modified accrual accounting, which measures cash
and all other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash. The governmental fund statements provide a
detailed short-term view of the District’s general government operations and the basic services it provides.
Governmental fund information helps to determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can
be spent in the near future to finance the District’s programs. The differences of results in the governmental fund
financial statements to those in the government-wide financial statements are explained in a reconciliation
following each governmental fund financial statement.

THE DISTRICT AS TRUSTEE

Reporting the District’s Fiduciary Responsibilities

The District is the trustee, or fiduciary, for funds held on behalf of others, like the funds managed for associated
student body activities. The District’s fiduciary activities are reported in the Statements of Fiduciary Net Position.
Management excludes these activities from the District’s other financial statements because the District cannot
use these assets to finance its operations. The District is responsible for ensuring that the assets reported in these
funds are used for their intended purposes.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

THE DISTRICT AS A WHOLE

Net Position

The District’s net position was $52,319,005 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, a 1.5 percent increase over
the net position for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. Of this amount, $35,775,810 is invested in capital assets,
net of related debt. Restricted net position is reported separately to show legal constraints from debt covenants
and enabling legislation that limit the Board of Education’s ability to use those net position for day-to-day
operations. Management’s analysis below focuses on the net position (Table 1) and on the change in net position
(Table 2) of the District’s governmental activities:

The results of this year’s operations for the District as a whole are reported in the Statement of Activities in the
audited financial statements. Table 2 takes the information from the statement, rounds off the numbers, and
rearranges them slightly so one can see total revenues for the year.

Governmental Activities

As reported in the Statement of Activities in the audited financial statements, the cost of all of our governmental
activities this year was $73.6 million. However, the amount that local taxpayers ultimately financed for these
activities through local taxes was only $61.6 million because those who benefited from the programs paid the cost
($0.7 million) or by other governments and organizations that subsidized certain programs with grants and
contributions ($11.3 million).

In Table 3, management has presented the cost of each of the District’s operating functions. As well as each
function’s net cost (total cost less revenues generated by the activities). As discussed above, net cost shows the
financial burden that was placed on the District’s taxpayers by each of these functions. Providing this information
allows the reader to consider the cost of each function in comparison to the benefits provided by that function.

THE DISTRICT’S FUNDS

As the District completed this year, our governmental funds reported a combined fund balance of $30.5 million
and of $12.4 million of which was in the General Fund.

General Fund Budgetary Highlights

Over the course of the year, the District revises its budget to reflect changes in revenues and expenditures. Budget
revisions were approved by the Board of Education on December 13, 2012, March 7, 2013, and June 20, 2013. (A
schedule showing the District’s original and final budget amounts compared with amounts actually paid and
received is provided in audited financial statements). Revisions were necessary to reflect material revenue
changes as outlined below:

 Revenue limit revisions were made due to property tax roll revenue estimate updates provided by the

Santa Clara County Controller-Treasurer Department throughout the year.

 Local revenue was adjusted to reflect grant funding and increases to lease income.
 Adjustments were made to State revenues to reflect funding adjustments to Categorical Programs and

Special Education.

Revisions were necessary to reflect material expenditure changes as outlined below:

Salary expenditures were adjusted to reflect step and column movements and negotiated salary increases.

 Adjustments were made to health, welfare, and statutory benefits to reflect personnel, premium, and rate

changes during the year.

DISCUSSION OF FISCAL YEAR 2012-2013 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2013-2014 AND BEYOND:

The Sunnyvale School District serves more than 6,700 students in grades pre-school through eighth grade and is
located in northwestern Santa Clara County adjacent to the cities of Santa Clara, Mountain View, and Cupertino
in the heart of Silicon Valley. About two-thirds of the K-8 students who live in the City of Sunnyvale are within
the boundaries of the Sunnyvale School District. The District’s share of the revenue generated by local property
taxes during FY 2012-2013 has exceeded the State Revenue Limit guarantees; therefore, the District continued as
a basic aid district. As such, general fund revenue does not increase with enrollment increases.

Although Sunnyvale School District is funded as a basic aid district, the community it serves does not fit the
image of the typical basic aid school district. The District’s ten schools serve students from widely diverse ethnic
and socio-economic backgrounds. The District emphasizes support for students from disadvantaged backgrounds
and provides curricula that are accessible to all students regardless of language, ethnicity, or socio-economic
background. The District’s ethnic breakdown is 39% Hispanic, 21% white, 24% Asian, 7% Filipino, and 9%
other.

SUNNYVALE SCHOOL DISTRICT

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
JUNE 30, 2013

The District’s mission statement is to prepare all of our students with a strong foundation of skills and knowledge
to succeed in their educational pursuits. To achieve this goal the District maintains and pursues expectations for a
high quality comprehensive preschool through eighth grade program. The District uses the framework of the
Seven Correlates of Effective Schools as a basis for decision-making and they serve as our guiding principles.
The seven Correlates are:

Frequent monitoring of student progress
Safe and orderly environment
Opportunity to learn and student time on task
Climate of high expectations
Strong instructional leadership
Clear and focused mission
Positive home – school relations

As a result, the District strives to meet programmatic goals that will allow for reasonable class sizes, staff training
and support, counseling, preschools, libraries, medical assistance, before and after school programs, visual and
performing arts, physical education, sports, and summer schools. The District’s ongoing commitment
to
maintaining a balanced investment in programs for students, competitive salaries and benefits for those who serve
students, and meeting the operational needs of the District is even stronger with the improved current economic
environment. Sunnyvale School District has weathered the Great Recession and done so without harm or
interruption to services and support of our students.

Our students continue to make remarkable progress in achievement due to the relentless work of our teachers,
administrators, and support staff. During the lean years of the recession, Sunnyvale School District avoided
unfortunate cuts to school programs, layoffs, unpaid furlough days, and salary reductions through the support of
our community, and excellent fiscal policy and oversight by the Board of Education and the governance team.

The District is committed to continuing to provide a comprehensive instructional program while focusing services
on the students and communities most in need of support. The 2013-2014 school year is full of promise. Funding
for public schools has stabilized and the funding model itself has changed to focus financial support on the
students with the greatest needs. The district is adopting the Common Core State Educational Standards. We are
launching One-to-One: Technology to Support Learning, a three year plan to ensure access to all students in the
new ways of receiving educational content. On November 5, our community again showed its support by
approving Measure G. This new Bond Measure allows the District to support school facilities and instructional
technology.

(4,222,557)

Capital outlays to purchase or build capital assets are reported in
governmental funds as expenditures, however, for governmental activities,
those costs are shown in the Statement of Net Position and allocated over
their estimated useful lives as annual depreciation expense in the Statement
of Activities.

This is the amount by which capital outlays exceed depreciation in the
period.

Capital outlays
Depreciation expense

In the Statement of Activities, compensated absences are measured by the
amounts earned during the year. In the governmental funds, however,
expenditures for these items are measured by the amount of financial
resources used (essentially, the amounts actually paid). This year, vacation
paid was less than the amounts earned.

RECONCILIATION OF THE GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS STATEMENT OF
REVENUES, EXPENDITURES, AND CHANGES IN FUND BALANCES
TO THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013

Accreted interest on capital appreciation bonds in the Statement of
Activities differs from the amount reported in the governmental
funds because accreted interest does not require the use of current
financial resources, and thus is not recorded in the governmental
funds. In the Statement of Activities, however, accreted interest
expense is recognized as the interest accrues, regardless of when
it is due.

Interest on long-term debt in the statement of activities differs from the
amount reported in the governmental funds because interest is recorded as
an expenditure in the governmental funds when it is paid, and thus requires
the use of current financial resources. In the statement of activities,
however, interest expense is recognized as the interest accrues, regardless
of when it is paid.

In the statement of activities, the unfunded annual contribution (ARC) is
recognized as an expense, but is not recognized on the governmental funds.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Financial Reporting Entity

The Sunnyvale School District was organized in 1904 under the laws of the State of California. The District
operates under a locally-elected five-member Board form of government and provides educational services to
grades kindergarten through eighth as mandated by the State and/or Federal agencies. The District operates eight
elementary, and two middle schools.

A reporting entity is comprised of the primary government, component units, and other organizations that are
included to ensure the financial statements are not misleading. The primary government of the District consists of
all funds, departments, boards, and agencies that are not legally separate from the District. For Sunnyvale School
District, this includes general operations, food service, and student related activities of the District.

Basis of Presentation - Fund Accounting

The accounting system is organized and operated on a fund basis. A fund is defined as a fiscal and accounting
entity with a self-balancing set of accounts, which are segregated for the purpose of carrying on specific activities
or attaining certain objectives in accordance with special regulations, restrictions, or limitations. The District's
funds are grouped into two broad fund categories: governmental and fiduciary.

Governmental Funds

Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions typically are financed. Governmental
fund reporting focuses on the sources, uses, and balances of current financial resources. Expendable assets are
assigned to the various governmental funds according to the purposes for which they may or must be used.
Current liabilities are assigned to the fund from which they will be paid. The difference between governmental
fund assets and liabilities is reported as fund balance. The following are the District's governmental funds:

Major Governmental Funds

General Fund The General Fund is the chief operating fund for all districts. It is used to account for the ordinary
operations of the District. All transactions except those accounted for in another fund are accounted for in this
fund.

Fund 17, Special Reserve Fund for Other Than Capital Outlay Projects is currently defined as a special revenue
fund in the California State Accounting Manuel (CSAM) that does not meet the GASB Statement No. 54 special
revenue fund definition; not being substantially composed of restricted or committed revenue sources. While this
fund is authorized by statute and will remain open for internal reporting purposes, this fund functions effectively
as extensions of the General Fund, and accordingly has been combined with the General Fund for presentation in
these audited financial statements. As a result, the General Fund reflects an increase in assets, liabilities, fund
balance, and revenues of $8,805,589, $62,637, $8,742,952, and $29,839, respectively.

Building Fund The Building Fund exists primarily to account separately for proceeds from the sale of bonds
(Education Code Section 15146) and may not be used for any purposes other than those for which the bonds were
issued.

22

SUNNYVALE SCHOOL DISTRICT

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2013

Debt Service Funds The Debt Service Funds are used to account for the accumulation of restricted, committed,
or assigned resources for and the payment of principal and interest on general long-term obligations.

Bond Interest and Redemption Fund The Bond Interest and Redemption Fund is used for the repayment of
bonds issued for a District (Education Code Sections 15125-15262).

Nonmajor Governmental Funds

Special Revenue Funds The Special Revenue funds are used to account for the proceeds from specific revenue
sources (other than trusts, major capital projects, or debt service) that are restricted or committed to expenditures
for specified purposes and that compose a substantial portion of the inflows of the fund. Additional resources that
are restricted, committed, or assigned to the purpose of the fund may also be reported in the fund.

Child Development Fund The Child Development Fund is used to account separately for Federal, State, and
local revenues to operate child development programs and is to be used only for expenditures for the
operation of child development programs.

Cafeteria Fund The Cafeteria Fund is used to account separately for Federal, State, and local resources to
operate the food service program (Education Code sections 38090-38093) and is used only for those
expenditures authorized by the governing board as necessary for the operation of the District's food service
program (Education Code Sections 38091 and 38100).

Deferred Maintenance Fund The Deferred Maintenance Fund is used to account separately for State
apportionments and the District's contributions for deferred maintenance purposes (Education Code Sections
17582-17587) and for items of maintenance approved by the State Allocation Board.

Capital Project Funds The Capital Project funds are used to account for financial resources that are restricted,
committed, or assigned to the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities and other capital assets (other
than those financed by proprietary funds and trust funds).

Capital Facilities Fund The Capital Facilities Fund is used primarily to account separately for monies
received from fees levied on developers or other agencies as a condition of approving a development
(Education Code Sections 17620-17626). Expenditures are restricted to the purposes specified in Government
Code Sections 65970-65981 or to the items specified in agreements with the developer (Government Code
Section 66006).

County School Facilities Fund The County School Facilities Fund is established pursuant to Education Code
Section 17070.43 to receive apportionments from the 1998 State School Facilities Fund (Proposition lA), the
2002 State School Facilities Fund (Proposition 47), the 2004 State School Facilities Fund (Proposition 55), or
the 2006 State Schools Facilities Fund (Proposition 1D) authorized by the State Allocation Board for new
school facility construction, modernization projects, and facility hardship grants, as provided in the Leroy F.
Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 (Education Code Section 17070 et seq.).

Fiduciary Funds Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held in trustee or agent capacity for others that
cannot be used to support
into four
classifications: pension trust funds, investment trust funds, private-purpose trust funds, and agency funds. The key
distinction between trust and agency funds is that trust funds are subject to a trust agreement that affects the
degree of management involvement and the length of time that the resources are held.

the District's own programs. The fiduciary fund category is split

Agency funds are custodial in nature (assets equal liabilities) and do not involve measurement of results of
operations. The District's agency fund accounts for student body activities (ASB).

Basis of Accounting - Measurement Focus

Government-Wide Financial Statements The government-wide statements are prepared using the economic
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. This differs from the manner in which
governmental fund financial statements are prepared.

The government-wide statement of activities presents a comparison between expenses, both direct and indirect,
and program revenues for each governmental function and excludes fiduciary activity. Direct expenses are those
that are specifically associated with a service, program, or department and are therefore clearly identifiable to a
particular function. The District does not allocate indirect expenses to functions in the Statement of Activities,
except for depreciation. Program revenues include charges paid by the recipients of the goods or services offered
by the programs and grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements
of a particular program. Revenues that are not classified as program revenues are presented as general revenues.
The comparison of program revenues and expenses identifies the extent to which each function is self-financing
or draws from the general revenues of the District. Eliminations have been made to minimize the double counting
of internal activities

Net position should be reported as restricted when constraints are either externally imposed by creditors (such as
through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments or imposed by law
through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. The net position restricted for other activities result from
special revenue funds and the restrictions on their use.

Fund Financial Statements Fund financial statements report detailed information about the District. The focus of
governmental fund financial statements is on major funds rather than reporting funds by type. Each major fund is
presented in a separate column. Nonmajor funds are aggregated and presented in a single column.

Governmental Funds All governmental funds are accounted for using a flow of current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. With this measurement focus, only current
assets and current
liabilities generally are included on the balance sheet. The statement of revenues,
expenditures, and changes in fund balance reports on the sources (revenues and other financing sources) and
uses (expenditures and other financing uses) of current financial resources. This approach differs from the
manner in which the governmental activities of the government-wide statements are prepared. Governmental
fund financial statements therefore include reconciliations with brief explanations to better identify the
relationships between the government-wide statements prepared using the economic resources measurement
focus and the accrual basis of accounting, and the governmental fund financial statements, prepared using the
flow of current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Fiduciary Funds Fiduciary funds are accounted for using the flow of economic resources measurement focus
and the accrual basis of accounting. Fiduciary funds are excluded from the government-wide financial
statements because they do not represent resources of the District.

Revenues – Exchange and Non-Exchange Transactions Revenue resulting from exchange transactions, in
which each party gives and receives essentially equal value, is recorded on the accrual basis when the exchange
takes place. On a modified accrual basis, revenue is recorded in the fiscal year in which the resources are
measurable and become available. Available means that the resources will be collected within the current fiscal
year or are expected to be collected soon enough thereafter to be used to pay liabilities of the current fiscal year.
Generally, available is defined as collectible within 45 or 60 days. However, to achieve comparability of reporting
among California districts and so as not to distort normal revenue patterns, with specific respect to reimbursement
grants and corrections to state-aid apportionments, the California Department of Education has defined available
for districts as collectible within one year. The following revenue sources are considered to be both measurable
and available at fiscal year-end: State apportionments, interest, certain grants, and other local sources.

Non-exchange transactions, in which the District receives value without directly giving equal value in return,
include property taxes, certain grants, entitlements, and donations. Revenue from property taxes is recognized in
the fiscal year in which the taxes are received. Revenue from certain grants, entitlements, and donations is
recognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied. Eligibility requirements
include time and purpose restrictions. On a modified accrual basis, revenue from non-exchange transactions must
also be available before it can be recognized.

Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue arises when potential revenue does not meet both the "measurable" and
"available" criteria for recognition in the current period or when resources are received by the District prior to the
incurrence of qualifying expenditures. In subsequent periods, when both revenue recognition criteria are met, or
when the District has a legal claim to the resources, the liability for deferred revenue is removed from the balance
sheet and revenue is recognized.

Expenses/Expenditures On the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are recognized at the time they are
incurred. The measurement focus of governmental fund accounting is on decreases in net financial resources
(expenditures) rather than expenses. Expenditures are generally recognized in the accounting period in which the
related fund liability is incurred, if measurable, and typically paid within 90 days. Principal and interest on
general long-term obligations, which have not matured, are recognized when paid in the governmental funds as
expenditures. Allocations of costs, such as depreciation and amortization, are not recognized in the governmental
funds but are recognized in the entity-wide statements.

Deposits and Investments

The District's deposits and investments are considered to be cash on hand, demand deposits, and investments with
the County Treasury.

Investments

Investments held at June 30, 2013, with original maturities greater than one year are stated at fair value. Fair value
is estimated based on quoted market prices at year-end. Fair values of investments in county pools are determined
by the program sponsor.

Prepaid Expenditures

Prepaid expenditures (expenses) represent amounts paid in advance of receiving goods or services. The District
has the option of reporting an expenditure in governmental funds for prepaid items either when purchased or
during the benefiting period. The District has chosen to report the expenditures over the benefiting period.

Stores Inventories

Inventories consist of expendable food and supplies held for consumption and unused donated commodities.
Inventories are stated at cost, on the weighted average basis. The costs of inventory items are recorded as
expenditures in the governmental funds when used.

Capital Assets and Depreciation

The accounting and reporting treatment applied to the capital assets associated with a fund are determined by its
measurement focus. Capital assets are long-lived assets of the District. The District maintains a capitalization
threshold of $5,000. The District does not possess any infrastructure. Improvements are capitalized; the costs of
normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend an asset's life are not
capitalized, but are expensed as incurred.

When purchased, such assets are recorded as expenditures in the governmental funds, and capitalized in the
government-wide Statement of Net Position. The valuation basis for general capital assets is historical cost, or
where historical cost is not available, estimated historical cost based on replacement cost. Donated capital assets
are capitalized at estimated fair market value on the date donated.

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives of the various classes of
depreciable capital assets are as follows: buildings, 20 to 50 years; improvements, 5 to 50 years; equipment, 2 to
15 years.

Interfund Balances

On fund financial statements, receivables and payables resulting from short-term interfund loans are classified as
"interfund receivables/payables." These amounts are eliminated in the governmental columns of the Statement of
Net Position.

Compensated Absences

Compensated absences are accrued as a liability as the benefits are earned. The entire compensated absence
liability is reported on the government-wide Statement of Net Position. For governmental funds, the current
portion of unpaid compensated absences is recognized upon the occurrence of relevant events such as employee
resignations and retirements that occur prior to year end that have not yet been paid with expendable available
financial resources. These amounts are reported in the fund from which the employees who have accumulated
leave are paid.

Sick leave is accumulated without limit for each employee at the rate of one day for each month worked. Leave
with pay is provided when employees are absent for health reasons; however, the employees do not gain a vested
right
termination of
employment or any other time. Therefore, the value of accumulated sick leave is not recognized as a liability in
the District's financial statements. However, credit for unused sick leave is applicable to all classified school
members who retire after January 1, 1999. At retirement, each member will receive .004 year of service credit for
each day of unused sick leave. Credit for unused sick leave if applicable to all certificated employees and is
determined by dividing the number of unused sick days by the number of base service days required to complete
the last school year, if employed full-time.

Accrued Liabilities and Long-Term Obligations

All payables, accrued liabilities, and long-term obligations are reported in the government-wide financial
statements. In general, governmental fund payables and accrued liabilities that, once incurred, are paid in a timely
manner and in full from current financial resources are reported as obligations of the funds.

However, claims and judgments, compensated absences, special termination benefits, and contractually required
pension contributions that will be paid from governmental funds are reported as a liability in the governmental
fund financial statements only to the extent that they are due for payment during the current year. Bonds, capital
leases, and long-term loans are recognized as a liability on the fund financial statements when due.

Deferred Issuance Costs, Premiums and Discounts, Deferred Amounts on Refunding

In the government-wide financial statements, long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable
governmental activities Statement of Net Position. Bond premiums and discounts, deferred amounts on refunding,
as well as issuance costs, are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using the straight-line method.

Fund Balances – Governmental Funds

As of June 30, 2013, fund balances of the governmental funds are classified as follows:

Nonspendable – amounts that cannot be spent either because they are in nonspendable form or because they are
legally or contractually required to be maintained intact.

Restricted – amounts that can be spent only for specific purposes because of constitutional provisions or enabling
legislation or because of constraints that are externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or the laws or
regulations of other governments.

Committed – amounts that can be used only for specific purposes determined by a formal action of the governing
board. The governing board is the highest level of decision-making authority for the District. Commitments may
be established, modified, or rescinded only through resolutions or other action as approved by the governing
board. The District currently does not have any committed funds.

Assigned – amounts that do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or committed but that are intended
to be used for specific purposes. Under the District's adopted policy, only the governing board may assign
amounts for specific purposes.

Unassigned – all other spendable amounts.

Spending Order Policy

When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance is available,
the District considers restricted funds to have been spent first. When an expenditure is incurred for which
committed, assigned, or unassigned fund balances are available, the District considers amounts to have been spent
first out of committed funds, then assigned funds, and finally unassigned funds, as needed, unless the governing
board has provided otherwise in its commitment or assignment actions.

Minimum Fund Balance Policy

In fiscal year 2010-11, the governing board adopted a minimum fund balance policy for the General Fund in order
to protect the district against revenue shortfalls or unpredicted on-time expenditures. The policy requires the
District to maintain a minimum fund balance of 10% of the District’s General Fund expenditures and other
financing uses. If a fund balance drops below 3%, it shall be recovered at a rate of 1% minimally each year.

Net Position

Net position represents the difference between assets and liabilities. Net position net of investment in capital
assets, consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, reduced by the outstanding balances of any net
borrowings used for the acquisition, construction or improvement of those assets. Net position is reported as
restricted when there are limitations imposed on their use either through the enabling legislation adopted by the
District or through external restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors, or laws or regulations of other
governments. The District first applies restricted resources when an expense is incurred for purposes for which
both restricted and unrestricted net position is available.

SUNNYVALE SCHOOL DISTRICT

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2013

Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Budgetary Data

The budgetary process is prescribed by provisions of the California Education Code and requires the governing
board to hold a public hearing and adopt an operating budget no later than July 1 of each year. The District
governing board satisfied these requirements. The adopted budget is subject to amendment throughout the year to
give consideration to unanticipated revenue and expenditures primarily resulting from events unknown at the time
of budget adoption with the legal restriction that expenditures cannot exceed appropriations by major object
account.

The amounts reported as the original budgeted amounts in the budgetary statements reflect the amounts when the
original appropriations were adopted. The amounts reported as the final budgeted amounts in the budgetary
statements reflect the amounts after all budget amendments have been accounted for. For budget purposes, on
behalf payments have not been included as revenue and expenditures as required under generally accepted
accounting principles.

Property Tax

Secured property taxes attach as an enforceable lien on property as of January 1. Taxes are payable in two
installments on November 1 and February 1 and become delinquent on December 10 and April 10, respectively.
Unsecured property taxes are payable in one installment on or before August 31. The County of Santa Clara bills
and collects the taxes on behalf of the District. Local property tax revenues are recorded when received.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2012, the GASB issued Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities. This
Statement establishes accounting and financial reporting standards that reclassify, as deferred outflows of
resources or deferred inflows of resources, certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities and
recognizes, as outflows of resources or inflows of resources, certain items that were previously reported as assets
and liabilities.

Concepts Statement No. 4, Elements of Financial Statements, introduced and defined the elements included in
financial statements, including deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources. In addition,
Concepts Statement 4 provides that reporting a deferred outflow of resources or a deferred inflow of resources
should be limited to those instances identified by the Board in authoritative pronouncements that are established
after applicable due process. Prior to the issuance of this Statement, only two such pronouncements have been
issued. Statement No. 53, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Derivative Instruments, requires the reporting
of a deferred outflow of resources or a deferred inflow of resources for the changes in fair value of hedging
derivative instruments, and Statement No. 60, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Service Concession
Arrangements, requires a deferred inflow of resources to be reported by a transferor government in a qualifying
service concession arrangement. This Statement amends the financial statement element classification of certain
items previously reported as assets and liabilities to be consistent with the definitions in Concepts Statement 4.
This Statement also provides other financial reporting guidance related to the impact of the financial statement

statements for periods beginning after

In June 2012, the GASB issued Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions—an
amendment of GASB Statement No. 27. The primary objective of this Statement is to improve accounting and
financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. It also improves information provided by state
and local governmental employers about financial support for pensions that is provided by other entities. This
Statement results from a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of existing standards of accounting and
financial reporting for pensions with regard to providing decision-useful information, supporting assessments of
accountability and inter-period equity, and creating additional transparency.

This Statement replaces the requirements of Statement No. 27, Accounting for Pensions by State and Local
Governmental Employers, as well as the requirements of Statement No. 50, Pension Disclosures, as they relate to
pensions that are provided through pension plans administered as trusts or equivalent arrangements (hereafter
jointly referred to as trusts) that meet certain criteria. The requirements of Statements 27 and 50 remain applicable
for pensions that are not covered by the scope of this Statement.

The scope of this Statement addresses accounting and financial reporting for pensions that are provided to the
employees of state and local governmental employers through pension plans that are administered through trusts
that have the following characteristics:

 Contributions from employers and non-employer contributing entities to the pension plan and earnings on

those contributions are irrevocable.





Pension plan assets are dedicated to providing pensions to plan members in accordance with the benefit
terms.

Pension plan assets are legally protected from the creditors of employers, non-employer contributing
entities, and the pension plan administrator. If the plan is a defined benefit pension plan, plan assets also are
legally protected from creditors of the plan members.

This Statement establishes standards for measuring and recognizing liabilities, deferred outflows of resources, and
deferred inflows of resources, and expense/expenditures. For defined benefit pensions, this Statement identifies
the methods and assumptions that should be used to project benefit payments, discount projected benefit
payments to their actuarial present value, and attribute that present value to periods of employee service.

Note disclosure and required supplementary information requirements about pensions also are addressed.
Distinctions are made regarding the particular requirements for employers based on the number of employers
whose employees are provided with pensions through the pension plan and whether pension obligations and
pension plan assets are shared. Employers are classified in one of the following categories for purposes of this
Statement:



Single employers are those whose employees are provided with defined benefit pensions through single-
employer pension plans—pension plans in which pensions are provided to the employees of only one
employer (as defined in this Statement).

30

SUNNYVALE SCHOOL DISTRICT

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2013

 Agent employers are those whose employees are provided with defined benefit pensions through agent
multiple-employer pension plans—pension plans in which plan assets are pooled for investment purposes
but separate accounts are maintained for each individual employer so that each employer’s share of the
pooled assets is legally available to pay the benefits of only its employees.

 Cost-sharing employers are those whose employees are provided with defined benefit pensions through
cost-sharing multiple-employer pension plans—pension plans in which the pension obligations to the
employees of more than one employer are pooled and plan assets can be used to pay the benefits of the
employees of any employer that provides pensions through the pension plan.

In addition, this Statement details the recognition and disclosure requirements for employers with liabilities
(payables) to a defined benefit pension plan and for employers whose employees are provided with defined
contribution pensions. This Statement also addresses circumstances in which a non-employer entity has a legal
requirement to make contributions directly to a pension plan.

This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2014. Early implementation is encouraged.

The District is considered to be an involuntary participant in an external investment pool as the District is required
to deposit all receipts and collections of monies with their County Treasurer (Education Code Section 41001). The
fair value of the District's investment in the pool is reported in the accounting financial statements at amounts
based upon the District's pro-rata share of the amortized cost basis provided by the County Treasurer for the entire
portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio). The balance available for withdrawal is based on the
accounting records maintained by the County Treasurer, which is recorded on the amortized cost basis.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to
changes in market interest rate. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by depositing substantially
all of its funds in the County Treasury pool. The fair value of the deposits with the County Treasurer at June 30,
2013, was $28,862,084 and the weighted average maturity of the pool less than one year.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment.
This is measure by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The
District’s investments in the county pool are not rated, as of June 30, 2013. U.S. Treasuries are exempt from this
disclosure.

Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits

This is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District's deposits may not be returned to it. The District
does not have a policy for custodial credit risk for deposits. However, the California Government Code requires
that a financial institution secure deposits made by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an
undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental
unit). The market value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total
amount deposited by the public agencies. California law also allows financial institutions to secure public deposits
by pledging first trust deed mortgage notes having a value of 150% of the secured public deposits and letters of
credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco having a value of 105% of the secured deposits.
The District believes it has no significant custodial credit risk.

NOTE 11 - POSTEMPLOYMENT HEALTH CARE PLAN AND OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT
BENEFITS (OPEB) OBLIGATION

Plan Description

The Postemployment Benefit Plan (the "Plan") is a single-employer defined benefit healthcare plan administered
by the Sunnyvale School District. The Plan provides medical, dental and vision insurance benefits to eligible
retirees and their spouses until the age of 65. Membership of the Plan consists of 49 retirees and 628 active plan
members as of the most recent actuarial valuation. Unfunded portion of annual required contributions (net OPEB
obligation) is presented in the Statement of Net Position as a portion of long-term obligations.

Funding Policy

The contribution requirements of plan members and the District are established and may be amended by the
District, the District’s bargaining units and unrepresented groups. The required contribution is based on projected
pay-as-you-go financing requirements, with an additional amount to prefund benefits as determined annually
through the agreements between the District, the District’s bargaining units and the unrepresented groups. For
fiscal year 2012-13, the District contributed $586,757 to the plan, all of which was used for current premiums
(approximately 70 percent of current year’s annual OPEB costs). The District contributed 100% of the total
premium on behalf of the members and 70% for the dependents of the plan members receiving benefits.

SUNNYVALE SCHOOL DISTRICT

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2013

Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation

The District's annual OPEB cost (expense) is calculated based on the annual required contribution of the employer
(ARC), an amount actuarially determined in accordance with the parameters of GASB Statement No. 45. The
ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover normal cost each year
and amortize any unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities (UAAL) (or funding excess) over a period not to exceed
thirty years. The following table shows the components of the District's annual OPEB cost for the year, the
amount actually contributed to the plan, and changes in the District's net OPEB obligation to the Plan:

Annual required contribution

Funded Status and Funding Progress

The schedule of funding progress presented as required supplementary information following the notes to the
financial statements, will present multiyear tread information that shows whether the actuarial value of plan assets
is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits. As of July 1, 2011,
the most recent actuarial valuation date, the plan has not been funded. The actuarial accrued liability for benefits
was $6,693,047, and the actuarial value of assets was zero, resulting in an UAAL of $6,693,047. The covered
payroll (annual payroll of active employees covered by the plan) was $38,884,465 and the ratio of the UAAL to
the covered payroll was 17.21 percent.

43

SUNNYVALE SCHOOL DISTRICT

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2013

Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions about
the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about future
employment, investment returns, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined regarding the
funded status of the Plan and the annual required contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as
actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of
funding progress, presented as required supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements,
presents multiyear trend information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing
over time relative to the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions

Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the plan as understood
by the employer and the plan members) and include the types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation
and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the employer and plan members to that point. The
actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce the effects of short-term
volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long-term perspective
of the calculations.

In the July 1, 2011, actuarial valuation, the projected unit credit cost method was used. The actuarial assumptions
included a five percent investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses), based on the District’s assumed
long-term return on plan assets or employer assets. Healthcare costs trend rates range from an initial eight percent
to an ultimate rate of five percent. The UAAL is being amortized at a level percentage of payroll method. The
remaining amortization period at July 1, 2011, was 30 years on an open period method.

NOTE 12 - RISK MANAGEMENT

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft, damage and destruction of assets; errors and
omissions; injuries to employees; life and health of employees; and natural disasters. The District purchases
commercial insurance for property damage with coverage up to a maximum of $500 million, subject to various
policy sublimits generally ranging from $25 thousand to $75 million and deductibles of $5,000 for electronic data
processing coverage and $100,000 per occurrence for all other claims.

Property and Liability

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors
and omissions; injuries to employees and natural disasters. During fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, the District
contracted with Santa Clara County Schools Insurance Group for property and liability insurance coverage.
Settled claims have not exceeded this commercial coverage in any of the past three years. There has not been a
significant reduction in coverage from the prior year.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2013

Workers' Compensation

For fiscal year 2013, the District participated in the Santa Clara County Schools’ Insurance Group (SCCSIG), an
insurance purchasing pool. The intent of the SCCSIG is to achieve the benefit of a reduced premium for the
District by virtue of its grouping and representation with other participants in the SCCSIG. The workers'
compensation experience of the participating districts is calculated as one experience and a common premium rate
is applied to all districts in the SCCSIG. Each participant pays its workers ' compensation premium based on its

NOTE 13 – EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS

Qualified employees are covered under multiple-employer retirement plans maintained by agencies of the State of
California. Certificated employees are members of the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS)
and classified employees are members of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS).

CalSTRS

Plan Description

The District contributes to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS); a cost-sharing multiple-
employer public employee retirement system defined benefit pension plan administered by CalSTRS. The plan
provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments and survivor benefits to
beneficiaries. Benefit provisions are established by State statutes, as legislatively amended, within the State
Teachers' Retirement Law. CalSTRS issues a separate comprehensive annual financial report that includes
financial statements and required supplementary information. Copies of the CalSTRS annual financial report may
be obtained from CalSTRS, 100 Waterfront Place, West Sacramento, CA 95605.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2013

Funding Policy

Active plan members are required to contribute 8.0 percent of their salary and the District is required to contribute
an actuarially determined rate. The actuarial methods and assumptions used for determining the rate are those
adopted by CalSTRS Teachers' Retirement Board. The required employer contribution rate for fiscal year 2012-
2013 was 8.25 percent of annual payroll. The contribution requirements of the plan members are established by
State statute. The District's contributions to CalSTRS for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
were $2,539,801, $2,230,757, and $2,258,663, respectively, and equal 100 percent of the required contributions
for each year.

CalPERS

Plan Description

The District contributes to the School Employer Pool under the California Public Employees' Retirement System
(CalPERS); a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system defined benefit pension plan
administered by CalPERS. The plan provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments,
and survivor benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. Benefit provisions are established by State statutes, as
legislatively amended, within the Public Employees' Retirement Laws. CalPERS issues a separate comprehensive
annual financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information. Copies of the
CalPERS' annual financial report may be obtained from the CalPERS Executive Office, 400 P Street, Sacramento,
CA 95811.

Funding Policy

Active plan members are required to contribute 7.0 percent of their salary and the District is required to contribute
an actuarially determined rate. The actuarial methods and assumptions used for determining the rate are those
adopted by the CalPERS Board of Administration. The required employer contribution rate for fiscal year 2012-
2013, 2011-2012 and 2010-2011 were 11.417, 10.707, and 9.709 percent of covered payroll, respectively. The
contribution requirements of the plan members are established by State statute. The District's contributions to
CalPERS for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, were $1,169,818, 1,096,057, and $1,060,531,
respectively, and equals 100 percent of the required contributions for each year.

Social Security

As established by Federal law, all public sector employees who are not members of their employer's existing
retirement system (CalSTRS or CalPERS) must be covered by social security or an alternative plan. The District
has elected to use Social Security as its alternative plan.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2013

On Behalf Payments

The State of California makes contributions to CalSTRS on behalf of the District. These payments consist of State
General Fund contributions to CalSTRS for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011 in the amount of
$1,442,507, $1,328,913, and $1,189,289, respectively. Contributions are no longer appropriated in the annual
Budget Act for the legislatively mandated benefits to CalPERS. Therefore, there is no on-behalf contribution rate
for CalPERS. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, these amounts are
to be reported as revenues and expenditures. Accordingly these amounts have been recorded in these financial
statements. On behalf payments have been excluded from the calculation of available reserves, and have not been
included in the budget amounts reported in the General Fund Budgetary Schedule.

NOTE 14 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Grants

The District received financial assistance from Federal and State agencies in the form of grants. The disbursement
of funds received under these programs generally requires compliance with terms and conditions specified in the
grant agreements and are subject to audit by the grantor agencies. Any disallowed claims resulting from such
audits could become a liability of the general fund or other applicable funds. However, in the opinion of
management, any such disallowed claims will not have a material adverse effect on the overall financial position
of the District at June 30, 2013.

NOTE 15 - PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC ENTITY RISK POOLS AND JOINT POWER
AUTHORITIES

The District is a member of the Santa Clara County Schools’ Insurance Group public entity risk pool and the
Silicon Valley Transportation Authority (JPA). The District pays an annual premium to Santa Clara County
Schools’ Insurance Group for its health, workers' compensation, and property liability coverage. Payments for
transportation services are paid to the Silicon Valley Transportation Authority JPA. The relationships between the
District, the pools, and the JPA's are such that they are not component units of the District for financial reporting
purposes.

These entities have budgeting and financial reporting requirements independent of member units and their
financial statements are not presented in these financial statements; however, fund transactions between the
entities and the District are included in these statements. Audited financial statements are available from the
respective entities.

The District has appointed one board member to the governing board of Santa Clara County Schools’ Insurance
Group and one board member to the Governing Board of Silicon Valley Transportation Authority.

During the year ended June 30, 2013, the District made payments of $358,169 to the Santa Clara County Schools’
Insurance Group and $1,284,969 to the Silicon Valley Transportation Authority.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORTS

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS

BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

Governing Board
Sunnyvale School District
Sunnyvale, California

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America
and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund,
and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Sunnyvale School District (the District) as of and for the
year ended June 30, 2013, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the
District's basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated December 9, 2013.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District's internal control over
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the
effectiveness of the District's internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct,
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the District's financial statements
will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough
to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section
and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or
significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal
control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been
identified.

66

Compliance and Other Matters

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free from material
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and
grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of
financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an
objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no
instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing
Standards.

Purpose of This Report

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control or on
compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing
Standards in considering the District's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not
suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR

EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY OMB CIRCULAR A-133

Governing Board
Sunnyvale School District
Sunnyvale, California

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program

We have audited the Sunnyvale School District's (the District) compliance with the types of compliance
requirements described in the OMB Circular A-133 Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material
effect on each of the major Federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2013. The major Federal programs are
identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned
costs.

Management's Responsibility

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants
applicable to its Federal programs.

Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major Federal programs based
on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable
to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United
States; and OMB Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations. Those
standards and OMB Circular A-133 require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a
direct and material effect on a major Federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the District's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major Federal
program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance.

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program

In our opinion, the District complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred
to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major Federal programs for the year ended
June 30, 2013.

68

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance

Management of the District is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of
compliance, we considered the District's internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that
could have a direct and material effect on each major Federal program to determine the auditing procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major
Federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with OMB Circular A-
133, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance.
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over compliance.

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance
does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to
prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a Federal program on a
timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that
there is a reasonable possibility that material
noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a Federal program will not be prevented, or detected and
corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a
Federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important
enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph
of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over
compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not
been identified.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of
internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of OMB Circular A-133.
Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON STATE COMPLIANCE

Governing Board
Sunnyvale School District
Sunnyvale, California

Report on State Compliance

We have audited Sunnyvale School District's (the District) compliance with the types of compliance requirements
as identified in the Standards and Procedures for Audit of California K-12 Local Educational Agencies 2012-
2013 that could have a direct and material effect on each of the Sunnyvale School District's State government
programs as noted below for the year ended June 30, 2013.

Management's Responsibility

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts and grants
applicable to its State’s programs.

Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance of each of the District's State programs based on our
audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the
Standards and Procedures for Audits of California K-12 Local Educational Agencies 2012-2013 require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the compliance
requirements referred to above that could have a material effect on the applicable government programs noted
below. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District's compliance with those
requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the
DistrictSunnyvale School District's compliance with those requirements.

Basis for Qualified Opinion

As described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs, the District did not comply with
requirements regarding After School Education and Safety (2013-1), and School Accountability Report Card
(2013-2). Compliance with such requirements is necessary, in our opinion, for the District to comply with the
requirements applicable to that program.

Qualified Opinion

In our opinion, except for the noncompliance described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph, the District
complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above for the year ended
June 30, 2013.

findings are coded as follows:

Five Digit Code

AB 3627 Finding Type

State Compliance

2013-1

Code 40000

Criteria
The purpose of the After School Education and Safety (ASES) program is to support student success
in school by providing academic support and enrichment opportunities. An ASES after school
program was never intended to be a drop-in or child care program. The legislature determined that
regular attendance would serve as the measure for demonstrating compliance with the legislation’s
purpose (EDC §8483[a][1]), intent (EDC §8483[a][2]), and criteria for ongoing program funding
(EDC §8483.7[a][1][A]).

Each site operating an After School Education and Safety (ASES) program is required to have sign-in
and sign-out procedures,
including early-release and late-arrival procedures, and to maintain
documentation in order to support the reported attendance.

Condition
A portion of reported students served resulted from attendance inconsistent with the ASES early
release policy because the established policy is not consistently followed.

Questioned Costs
The ASES base grant for the site in question is $85,050. We noted discrepancies comprising 60% of
sampled attendance at this site, resulting in projected questioned costs of $51,030.

Context
The above condition pertains to one of the District's seven ASES after school programs.

Effect
Operating a program inconsistent from the intent can result in the district unable to provide a basis
for future funding.

Recommendation
We recommend that the ASES sites and District establish procedures to review the sign-in and sign-
out documentation on a periodic basis and ensure that student are dismissed consistent with the
established early release policy.

Corrective Action Plan
We have reviewed our Early Release Policy and have established a system of cross checking monthly
sign in and out sheets to ensure that the early release codes used are accurate and reflect our
adherence to the state guidelines for the ASES program. In addition, our ASES staff have undergone
training to support their efforts in maintaining accurate documentation as related to attendance.

Five Digit Code

AB 3627 Finding Type

School Accountability Report Card

2013-2

Code 72000

Criteria
State law requires schools to undergo annual facility inspections. The results of such inspections are
reflected on the School Accountability Report Card (SARC) in accordance with EDC §33126(b). The
Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) or a locally developed
instrument that meets the same legal requirements must be utilized during these inspections to
determine if a school facility is in "good repair" and to rate the facility accordingly.

Certain provisions of the Williams settlement legislation apply to schools ranked in deciles 1-3 as
determined every three years by the Base Academic Performance Index (API). EDC §1240(c)(2)(F)
and (J) specifies that county superintendents must monitor decile 1-3 schools for: (1) sufficiency of
instructional materials; (2) facilities deficiencies; (3) accuracy of data reported on SARC related to
sufficiency of materials and facilities deficiencies; and (4) teacher misassignments and teacher
vacancies.

Condition
Two of the District's schools are ranked in deciles 1-3 and thus subject to external monitoring of
facilities deficiencies. The external evaluator's facilities instruments are not reflected on the facilities
portion of the 2012-13 SARC for the schools subject to monitoring. Instead, the District used its own
internal inspections in compilation of the facilities portion of the SARC.

Questioned Costs
There are no questioned costs associated with this condition because there is no funding directly
related to school accountability report cards.

Context
The above condition pertains to the 2012-13 SARC for each of the District’s schools that are subject
to monitoring under the Williams settlement.

Effect
Failure to use the external evaluator's facilities inspection could result
deficiencies not reflected on the SARC.

in identified facilities

Recommendation
Interdepartmental communication should ensure that information is shared across departments.

Corrective Action Plan
We have identified the cause for the miscommunication and have established a protocol that aligns
the Williams’ audit findings to our internal FIT findings. Henceforth the Williams’ FIT findings will
be incorporated into the annual SARC.

*These accounts reflect two components of the Retiree Health Fund. The third component is included in the Commingled Pool. 
**Yield to maturity (YTM) is the rate of return paid on a bond, note, or other fixed income security if the investor buys and holds it to its maturity date and if the coupon interest 
paid over the life of the bond is reinvested at the same rate as the coupon rate. The calculation for YTM is based on the coupon rate, length of time to maturity, and market price 
at time of purchase. 
 
Yield is a snapshot measure of the yield of the portfolio on the day it was measured based on the current portfolio holdings on that day. This is not a measure of total return, and 
is not intended to be, since it does not factor in unrealized capital gains and losses and reinvestment rates are dependent upon interest rate changes 
 
***Cost Value is the amortized book value of the securities as of the date of this report. 

1Santa Clara County Commingled Pool and Segregated Investments

Portfolio Strategy

March 31, 2014

March’s job report and refinements of the prior months showed a modest improvement in hiring and was in line with expectations. The Fed will 
most likely not change direction based on the data to date. All longer term rates declined after the employment report, showing a general 
consensus that there will be little change in Fed policy in the near term.  There is little on the horizon that would indicate significant changes in the 
economy and the ongoing gridlock in Washington will not provide any meaningful legislation to stimulate growth.  There may be a topping of the 
equity markets as new quarterly earnings reports may not show enough improvement to support the robust market of the past year.  If this is 
correct, then there will be little reason to expect rates to rise in the next few months.  

The County’s investment program continues to face a challenge in this low interest rate environment to provide meaningful earnings for the funds 
that are being managed.  Overnight rates generally are 5 basis points or less and longer term agency discount notes are about 10 basis points. Much 
of the new tax revenues will be placed in fairly short-term maturities based on cash flow needs of the program, but when high quality corporate 
notes become available, some longer term purchases will be made to support the yield of the pool. Asset back securities also offer the opportunity 
to enhance portfolio yield. At this time they only represent about 2% of the portfolio. The Investment Unit will consider the merits of increasing the 
amount invested in this type of security. We will only purchase the highest rated securities , and in addition to reviewing the rating agency 
classifications, will limit purchases to well-known issuers who have stable forecasts.  This area represents an opportunity to enhance portfolio yield 
with very little risk. As always cash flows and safety are paramount in investment decisions. 

It appears unlikely that we will get out of this low rate environment for some time and efforts to provide significant earnings will remain a difficult 
challenge in the months ahead.    

As discussed in last quarter’s report the Retiree Health Specific Investments has been reduced to two fixed income securities and the pages in this 
report have been removed since there is no change in activity.

Portfolio Compliance, Review, and Monitoring

March 31, 2014

Yield and Weighted Average Maturity
The yield of the Commingled Pool is 0.49% and the weighted average life is 426 days.

Compliance
Investment transactions were executed in accordance with the California State Government Code and the County's Investment Policy, as indicated in the 
attached report from the County Internal Audit Division.  The County Treasurer believes the Commingled Pool contains sufficient cash flow liquidity to meet 
the next six months of expected expenditures.

Review and Monitoring
FTN Financial Main Street Advisors, the County’s investment advisor, currently monitors the Treasury Department’s investment activities.  

Additional Information
Securities are purchased with the expectation that they will be held to maturity, so unrealized gains or losses are not reflected in the yield calculations. 
The market values of securities were taken from pricing services provided by the Bank of New York Mellon, Bloomberg Analytics, dealer quotes, and an 
independent pricing service.

 [Letterhead of Quint & Thimmig LLP] 

[Closing Date] 

 
 
Board of Education of the 
 Sunnyvale School District 
819 West Iowa Avenue 
Sunnyvale, California 94086 
 

OPINION: 

$28,000,000  Sunnyvale  School  District  (Santa  Clara  County,  California)  General 
Obligation Bonds, Election of 2013, Series A (2014) 

 
 
Members of the Board of Education: 
 

We have acted as bond counsel to the Sunnyvale School District (the “District”) in connection with the 
issuance  by  the  District  of  $28,000,000  principal  amount  of  Sunnyvale  School  District  (Santa  Clara  County, 
California) General Obligation Bonds, Election of 2013, Series A (2014) (the “Bonds”), pursuant to the provisions 
of  Article  4.5  of  Chapter  3  of  Part  1  of  Division  2  of  Title  5  (commencing  with  section  53506)  of  the  California 
Government Code (the “Act”), and a resolution adopted by the Board of Education of the District on March 6, 2014 
(the  “Resolution”).  We  have  examined  the  law  and  such  certified  proceedings  and  other  papers  as  we  deemed 
necessary to render this opinion. 

 
As  to  questions  of  fact  material  to  our  opinion,  we  have  relied  upon  representations  of  the  District 
contained in the Resolution and in the certified proceedings and certifications of public officials and others furnished 
to us, without undertaking to verify such facts by independent investigation. 

 
Based upon our examination, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that: 
 
1. The District is duly created and validly existing as a school district with the power to cause the Board to 

issue the Bonds in its name and to perform its obligations under the Resolution and the Bonds. 

 
2. The Resolution has been duly adopted by the District and creates a valid first lien on the funds pledged 

under the Resolution for the security of the Bonds. 

 
3. The Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Board and are valid and binding 
general obligations of the District. The Board of Supervisors of Santa Clara County is required under the Act to levy 
a tax upon all taxable property in the District for the interest and redemption of all outstanding bonds of the District, 
including the Bonds. The Bonds are payable from an ad valorem tax levied without limitation as to rate or amount. 

 
4.  Subject  to  the  District’s  compliance  with  certain  covenants,  interest  on  the  Bonds  is  excludable  from 
gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes and is not included as an item of tax preference 
in  computing  the  alternative  minimum  tax  for  individuals  and  corporations  under  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of 

Appendix E 

Page 1 

 

1986, as amended, but is taken into account in computing an adjustment used in determining the federal alternative 
minimum tax for certain corporations. Failure to comply with certain of such District covenants could cause interest 
on the Bonds to be includible in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactively to the date of issuance of 
the Bonds. 

 
5. The interest on the Bonds is exempt from personal income taxation imposed by the State of California. 
 
Ownership  of  the  Bonds  may  result  in  other  tax  consequences  to  certain  taxpayers,  and  we  express  no 

opinion regarding any such collateral consequences arising with respect to the Bonds. 

 
The rights of the owners of the Bonds and the enforceability of the Bonds and the Resolution may be subject 
to  the  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  and  other  similar  laws  affecting  creditors’  rights 
heretofore  or  hereafter  enacted  and  also  may  be  subject  to  the  exercise  of  judicial  discretion  in  accordance  with 
general principles of equity. 

 
Our opinion represents our legal judgment based upon such review of the law and the facts that we deem 
relevant to render our opinion and is not a guarantee of a result. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and we 
assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances that may hereafter 
come to our attention or any changes in law that may hereafter occur. 

 

Respectfully submitted,

Section 7. Termination of Reporting Obligation. The District’s obligations under this Disclosure Certificate 
shall  terminate  upon  the  defeasance,  prior  redemption  or  payment  in  full  of  all  of  the  Bonds.  If  such  termination 
occurs prior to the final maturity of the Bonds, the District shall give notice of such termination in the same manner 
as for a Listed Event under Section 5(c).  

 
Section 8. Dissemination Agent. 
 
(a)  Appointment  of  Dissemination  Agent.  The  District  may,  from  time  to  time,  appoint  or  engage  a 
Dissemination Agent to assist it in carrying out its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate and may discharge 
any such agent, with or without appointing a successor Dissemination Agent. If the Dissemination Agent is not the 
District,  the  Dissemination  Agent  shall  not  be  responsible  in  any  manner  for  the  content  of  any  notice  or  report 
prepared by the District pursuant to this Disclosure Certificate. It is understood and agreed that any information that 
the Dissemination Agent may be instructed to file with EMMA shall be prepared and provided to it by the District. 
The  Dissemination  Agent  has  undertaken  no  responsibility  with  respect  to  the  content  of  any  reports,  notices  or 
disclosures  provided  to  it  under  this  Disclosure  Certificate  and  has  no  liability  to  any  person,  including  any 
Bondholder, with respect to any such reports, notices or disclosures. The fact that the Dissemination Agent or any 
affiliate thereof may have any fiduciary or banking relationship with the District shall not be construed to mean that 
the  Dissemination  Agent  has  actual  knowledge  of  any  event  or  condition,  except  as  may  be  provided  by  written 
notice from the District. 

 
(b)  Compensation  of  Dissemination  Agent.  The  Dissemination  Agent  shall  be  paid  compensation  by  the 
District  for  its  services  provided  hereunder  in  accordance  with  its  schedule  of  fees  as  agreed  to  between  the 
Dissemination Agent and the District from time to time and all expenses, legal fees and expenses and advances made 
or incurred by the Dissemination Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder. The Dissemination Agent shall 
not be deemed to be acting in any fiduciary capacity for the District, owners or Beneficial Owners, or any other party. 
The Dissemination Agent may rely, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting, upon any direction 
from the District or an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel. The Dissemination Agent may at any time 
resign  by  giving  written  notice  of  such  resignation  to  the  District.  The  Dissemination  Agent  shall  not  be  liable 
hereunder except for its negligence or willful misconduct. 

 
(c) Responsibilities of Dissemination Agent. In addition of the filing obligations of the Dissemination Agent set 
forth in Sections 3(e) and 5, the Dissemination Agent shall be obligated, and hereby agrees, to provide a request to 
the  District  to  compile  the  information  required  for  its  Annual  Report  at  least  30  days  prior  to  the  date  such 
information  is  to  be  provided  to  the  Dissemination  Agent  pursuant  to  subsection  (c)  of  Section  3.  The  failure  to 
provide or receive any such request shall not affect the obligations of the District under Section 3. 

 
Section  9.  Amendment;  Waiver.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Disclosure  Certificate,  the 
District  may  amend  this  Disclosure  Certificate  (and  the  Dissemination  Agent  shall  agree  to  any  amendment  so 
requested by the District that does not impose any greater duties or risk of liability on the Dissemination Agent), and 
any provision of this Disclosure Certificate may be waived, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied: 

 
(a) Change in Circumstances. If the amendment or waiver relates to the provisions of Sections 3(a), 4 or 5(a) 
or  (b),  it  may  only  be  made  in  connection  with  a  change  in  circumstances  that  arises  from  a  change  in  legal 
requirements, change in law, or change in the identity, nature, or status of an obligated person with respect to the 
Bonds, or the type of business conducted. 

 
(b) Compliance as of Issue Date. The undertaking, as amended or taking into account such waiver, would, in 
the opinion of a nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with the requirements of the Rule at the time of 
the original issuance of the Bonds, after taking into account any amendments or interpretations of the Rule, as well as 
any change in circumstances. 

 
(c)  Consent  of  Holders;  Non-impairment  Opinion.  The  amendment  or  waiver  either  (i)  is  approved  by  the 
Bondholders in the same manner as provided in the Resolutions for amendments to the Resolutions with the consent 

Appendix F 

Page 4 

 

of Bondholders, or (ii) does not, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, materially impair the interests 
of the Bondholders or Beneficial Owners. 

 
If  this  Disclosure  Certificate  is  amended  or  any  provision  of  this  Disclosure  Certificate  is  waived,  the 
District  shall  describe  such  amendment  or  waiver  in  the  next  following  Annual  Report  and  shall  include,  as 
applicable, a narrative explanation of the reason for the amendment or waiver and its impact on the type (or in the 
case  of  a  change  of  accounting  principles,  on  the  presentation)  of  financial  information  or  operating  data  being 
presented  by  the  District.  In  addition,  if  the  amendment  relates  to  the  accounting  principles  to  be  followed  in 
preparing  financial  statements,  (i)  notice  of  such  change  shall  be  given  in  the  same  manner  as  for  a  Listed  Event 
under Section 5(c), and (ii) the Annual Report for the year in which the change is made should present a comparison 
(in narrative form and also, if feasible, in quantitative form) between the financial statements as prepared on the basis 
of the new accounting principles and those prepared on the basis of the former accounting principles. 

 
Section 10. Additional Information. Nothing in this Disclosure Certificate shall be deemed to prevent the 
District  from  disseminating  any  other  information,  using  the  means  of  dissemination  set  forth  in  this  Disclosure 
Certificate or any other means of communication, or including any other information in any Annual Report or notice 
of occurrence of a Listed Event, in addition to that which is required by this Disclosure Certificate. If the District 
chooses to include any information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event in addition to that 
which  is  specifically  required  by  this  Disclosure  Certificate,  the  District  shall  have  no  obligation  under  this 
Disclosure Certificate to update such information or include it in any future Annual Report or notice of occurrence 
of a Listed Event.  

 
Section 11. Default. In the event of a failure of the District to comply with any provision of this Disclosure 
Certificate,  any  Bondholder  or  Beneficial  Owner  may  take  such  actions  as  may  be  necessary  and  appropriate, 
including seeking mandate or specific performance by court order, to cause the District to comply with its obligations 
under this Disclosure Certificate. The sole remedy under this Disclosure Certificate in the event of any failure of the 
District to comply with this Disclosure Certificate shall be an action to compel performance.  

 
Section 12. Duties, Immunities and Liabilities of Dissemination Agent. The Dissemination Agent shall have 
only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Disclosure Certificate, and no implied covenants or obligations 
shall be read into this Disclosure Certificate against the Dissemination Agent, and the District agrees to indemnify 
and save the Dissemination Agent, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless against any loss, expense 
and liabilities which it may incur arising out of or in the exercise or performance of its powers and duties hereunder, 
including the costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) of defending against any claim of liability, 
but  excluding  liabilities  due  to  the  Dissemination  Agent’s  negligence  or  willful  misconduct.  The  Dissemination 
Agent shall have the same rights, privileges and immunities hereunder as are afforded to the Paying Agent under the 
Resolutions.  The  obligations  of  the  District  under  this  Section  12  shall  survive  resignation  or  removal  of  the 
Dissemination Agent and payment of the Bonds.

BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM 

 
 
The  following  description  of  the  procedures  and  record  keeping  with  respect  to  beneficial  ownership 
interests  in  the  Bonds,  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  to  Direct  Participants,  Indirect 
Participants or Beneficial Owners (as such terms are defined below) of the Bonds, confirmation and transfer of 
beneficial  ownership  interests  in  the  Bonds  and  other  Bond  related  transactions  by  and  between  DTC,  Direct 
Participants, Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of the Bonds is based solely on information furnished by 
DTC to the District which the District believes to be reliable, but the District and the Underwriter do not and 
cannot  make  any  independent  representations  concerning  these  matters  and  do  not  take  responsibility  for  the 
accuracy or completeness thereof. Neither the DTC, Direct Participants, Indirect Participants nor the Beneficial 
Owners should rely on the foregoing information with respect to such matters, but should instead confirm the same 
with DTC or the DTC Participants, as the case may be. 

 
The  Depository  Trust  Company  (“DTC”),  New  York,  New  York,  will  act  as  securities 
depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of 
Cede  &  Co.  (DTC’s  partnership  nominee)  or  such  other  name  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized 
representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds, each in 
the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. 

 
DTC,  the  world’s  largest  securities  depository,  is  a  limited-purpose  trust  company  organized 
under  the  New  York  Banking  Law,  a  “banking  organization”  within  the  meaning  of  the  New  York 
Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of 
the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions 
of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 
3.5  million  issues  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  equity  issues,  corporate  and  municipal  debt  issues  and  money 
market  instruments  (from  over  100  countries)  that  DTC’s  participants  (“Direct  Participants”)  deposit 
with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other 
securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and 
pledges  between  Direct  Participants’  accounts.  This  eliminates  the  need  for  physical  movement  of 
securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, 
banks,  trust  companies,  clearing  corporations,  and  certain  other  organizations.  DTC  is  a  wholly-owned 
subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company 
for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation all of which 
are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the 
DTC  system  is  also  available  to  others  such  as  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  securities  brokers  and  dealers, 
banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship 
with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & 
Poor’s  rating  of  AA+.  The  DTC  Rules  applicable  to  its  Participants  are  on  file  with  the  Securities  and 
Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org. 

 
Purchases  of  Bonds  under  the  DTC  system  must  be  made  by  or  through  Direct  Participants, 
which  will  receive  a  credit  for  the  Bonds  on  DTC’s  records.  The  ownership  interest  of  each  actual 
purchaser  of  each  Bond  (“Beneficial  Owner”)  is  in  turn  to  be  recorded  on  the  Direct  and  Indirect 
Participants’  records.  Beneficial  Owners  will  not  receive  written  confirmation  from  DTC  of  their 
purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of 

Appendix G 

Page 1 

 

the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant 
through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the 
Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on 
behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership 
interests in the Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued. 

 
To  facilitate  subsequent  transfers,  all  Bonds  deposited  by  Direct  Participants  with  DTC  are 
registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede &Co. or such other name as requested by an 
authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name 
of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no 
knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the 
Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial 
Owners. The Direct or Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings 
on behalf of their customers. 

 
Conveyance  of  notices  and  other  communications  by  DTC  to  Direct  Participants,  by  Direct 
Participants  to  Indirect  Participants,  and  by  Direct  Participants  and  Indirect  Participants  to  Beneficial 
Owners  will  be  governed  by  arrangements  among  them,  subject  to  any  statutory  or  regulatory 
requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take certain 
steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Bonds, such 
as tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Bonds documents. For example, Beneficial Owners 
of  the  Bonds  may  wish  to  ascertain  that  the  nominee  holding  the  Bonds  for  their  benefit  has  agreed  to 
obtain  and  transmit  notices  to  Beneficial  Owners.  In  the  alternative,  Beneficial  Owners  may  wish  to 
provide  their  names  and  addresses  to  the  Paying  Agent  and  request  that  copies  of  notices  be  provided 
directly to them. 

 
Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to 
the Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under 
its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the District as soon as possible after the record 
date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to 
whose accounts the Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus 
Proxy). 

 
Payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other 
nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct 
Participants’  accounts  upon  DTC’s  receipt  of  funds  and  corresponding  detail  information  from  the 
District  or  the  Paying  Agent,  on  payable  date  in  accordance  with  their  respective  holdings  shown  on 
DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions 
and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or 
registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, the Paying 
Agent or the District, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to 
time. Payment of principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an 
authorized  representative  of  DTC)  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Paying  Agent,  disbursement  of  such 
payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to 
the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. 

 
DTC may discontinue providing its service as depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by 
giving reasonable notice to the District or the Paying Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a 

Appendix G 

Page 2 

 

successor depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered. 

 
The  District  may  decide  to  discontinue  use  of  the  system  of  book-entry-only  transfers  through 
DTC  (or  a  successor  securities  depository).  In  that  event,  the  Bond  certificates  will  be  printed  and 
delivered to DTC. 

 
The  information  in  this  section  concerning  DTC  and  DTC’s  book-entry  system  has  been 
obtained from sources that the District believes to be reliable, but the District takes no responsibility for 
the accuracy thereof. 

 
In  the  event  that  (a)  DTC  determines  not  to  continue  to  act  as  securities  depository  for  the 
Bonds, or (b) the District determines that DTC shall no longer act and delivers a written certificate to the 
Paying Agent to that effect, then the District will discontinue the Book-Entry System with DTC for the 
Bonds. If the District determines to replace DTC with another qualified securities depository, the District 
will prepare or direct the preparation of a new single separate, fully registered Bond for each maturity of 
the  Bonds  registered  in  the  name  of  such  successor  or  substitute  securities  depository  as  are  not 
inconsistent with the terms of the Resolution. If the District fails to identify another qualified securities 
depository to replace the incumbent securities depository for the Bonds, then the Bonds shall no longer be 
restricted  to  being  registered  in  the  Bond  registration  books  in  the  name  of  the  incumbent  securities 
depository  or  its  nominee,  but  shall  be  registered  in  whatever  name  or  names  the  incumbent  securities 
depository or its nominee transferring or exchanging the Bonds shall designate. 

 
In  the  event  that  the  Book-Entry  System  is  discontinued,  the  following  provisions  would  also 
apply: (i) the Bonds will be made available in physical form, (ii) payment of principal of and interest on the 
Bonds  will  be  payable  upon  surrender  thereof  at  the  trust  office  of  the  Paying  Agent  identified  in  the 
Resolution, and (iii) the Bonds will be transferable and exchangeable as provided in the Resolution. 

 
The District and the Paying Agent do not have any responsibility or obligation to DTC Participants, to 
the persons for whom they act as nominees, to Beneficial Owners, or to any other person who is not shown on the 
registration books as being an owner of the Bonds, with respect to (i) the accuracy of any records maintained by 
DTC or any DTC Participants; (ii) the payment by DTC or any DTC Participant of any amount in respect of the 
principal of and interest on the Bonds; (iii) the delivery of any notice which is permitted or required to be given to 
registered owners under the Resolution; (iv) any consent given or other action taken by DTC as registered owner; 
or (v) any other matter arising with respect to the Bonds or the Resolution. The District and the Paying Agent 
cannot  and  do  not  give  any  assurances  that  DTC,  DTC  Participants  or  others  will  distribute  payments  of 
principal of and interest on the Bonds paid to DTC or its nominee, as the registered owner, or any notices to the 
Beneficial Owners or that they will do so on a timely basis or will serve and act in a manner described in this 
Official Statement. The District and the Paying Agent are not responsible or liable for the failure of DTC or any 
DTC Participant to make any payment or give any notice to a Beneficial Owner in respect to the Bonds or any 
error or delay relating thereto.
