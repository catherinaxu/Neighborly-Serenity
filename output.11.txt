(See “RATINGS” herein) 

In  the  opinion  of  Jones  Hall,  A  Professional  Law  Corporation,  San  Francisco,  California,  Bond  Counsel,  subject,  however  to 
certain qualifications described herein, under existing law, the interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income 
tax purpose and such interest is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals 
and corporations, although for the purpose of computing the alternative minimum tax imposed on certain corporations, such interest is 
taken into account in determining certain income and earnings, and the Bonds are “qualified tax-exempt obligations” within the meaning 
of  Section  265(b)(3)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986.    In  the  further  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel,  such  interest  is  exempt  from 
California personal income taxes.  See "TAX MATTERS" herein.

The  offering  of  the  Bonds  to  potential  investors  is  made  only  by  means  of  the  entire  Official 
Statement. 

 
The District. The District was established as a school district in 1865.  The District is 
located in Sonoma County (the “County”) and serves the communities in southwest Santa Rosa 
between  West  Third  Street  and  Ludwig  Avenue  (north/south)  and  Stony  Point  and  Merced 
Avenues  (east/west).  The  District  encompasses  approximately  5.5  square  miles  serving 
approximately  1,615  students.  The  District  currently  operates  three  elementary  schools.  For 
more information on the District, see “APPENDIX A – DISTRICT GENERAL AND FINANCIAL 
INFORMATION.” 

  
Description of the Bonds. The Bonds are being issued as current interest bonds (the 
“Current  Interest  Bonds”)  and  capital  appreciation  bonds  (the  “Capital  Appreciation 
Bonds”).  The Bonds mature in the years and in the amounts as set forth on the inside cover 
page hereof.  The Bonds will be issued in book-entry form only, and will be initially issued and 
registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for DTC.  Purchasers will not receive physical

as described herein.  Beneficial Owners will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of the 

 

 

 

Bonds.  See “APPENDIX F - BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM.”  In the event that the book-entry-
only  system  described  below  is  no  longer  used  with  respect  to  the  Bonds,  the  Bonds  will  be 
registered  in  accordance  with  the  Bond  Resolution  described  herein.    See  “THE  BONDS  -- 
Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Bonds.” 

 
Redemption.    The  Bonds  are  subject  to  redemption  prior  to  maturity  as  described  in 

“THE BONDS – Optional Redemption” and “– Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption.”   

 
Authority for Issuance of the Bonds.  Issuance of the Bonds was approved by 55% or 
more  of  the  voters  of  the  District  voting  at  an  election  held  on  June  5,  2012  (the 
“Authorization”),  and  the  Bonds  will  be  issued  pursuant  to  certain  provisions  of  the 
Government  Code  of  the  State  of  California  (the  “State”)  and  a  resolution  adopted  by  the 
District  on  August  21,  2014  (the  “Bond  Resolution”).    See  “THE  BONDS  -  Authority  for 
Issuance” herein. 

 
Security for the Bonds.  The Bonds are general obligations of the District.  The Board 
of Supervisors of the County has the power and is obligated to annually levy ad valorem taxes 
for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due upon all property within 
the  District  subject  to  taxation  without  limitation  of  rate  or  amount  (except  certain  personal 
property which is taxable at limited rates).  See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS” herein. 

 
Bond Insurance.  Concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds, Build America Mutual 
Assurance Company (“BAM”) will issue its Municipal Bond Insurance Policy for the Bonds (the 
“Policy”).    The  Policy  guarantees  the  scheduled  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the 
Bonds when due as set forth in the form of the Policy included as APPENDIX H to this Official 
Statement. See “BOND INSURANCE.”  

 
Purpose of Issue.  The net proceeds of the Bonds will be used to finance the specific 
school  facilities  projects  set  forth  in  the  ballot  measure  approved  in  connection  with  the 
Authorization.    See  “THE  BONDS  --  Purpose  of  Issue”  and  “SOURCES  AND  USES  OF 
FUNDS” herein. 

 
Offering and Delivery of the Bonds.  The Bonds are offered when, as and if issued 
and received by the Underwriter identified on the cover page hereof, subject to approval as to 
their  legality  by  Jones  Hall,  A  Professional  Law  Corporation,  as  bond  counsel  (“Bond 
Counsel”).  It is anticipated that the Bonds will be available for delivery through the facilities of 
DTC on or about September 17, 2014. 

 
Legal  Matters.    Issuance  of  the  Bonds  is  subject  to  the  approving  opinion  of  Bond 
Counsel, to be delivered in substantially the form attached hereto as Appendix D.  Jones Hall, A 
Professional Law Corporation will also serve as disclosure counsel (“Disclosure Counsel”) to 
the District. Payment of the fees of Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel is contingent upon 
issuance of the Bonds. 

 
Tax  Matters.    Assuming  compliance  with  certain  covenants  and  provisions  of  the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, in the opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds will not 
be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes although it may be includable in 
the calculation for certain taxes, and the Bonds are “qualified tax-exempt obligations” within the 
meaning of Section 265(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Also in the 
opinion  of  Bond  Counsel,  interest  on  the  Bonds  will  be  exempt  from  State  of  California  (the 
“State”) personal income taxes.  See “TAX MATTERS” herein.

purposes: 

 
“To  improve  the  quality  of  education;  repair  or  replace  leaky  roofs;  improve 
student  access  to  computers  and  modern  technology;  construct  additional 
classrooms, restrooms and school facilities; improve energy efficiency; upgrade 
inadequate  electrical  systems;  make  health  and  safety  improvements;  and

$14,000,000  of  bonds  at  legal  interest  rates,  have  an  independent  citizens’ 
oversight committee and have no money used for administrative salaries or be

Description of the Bonds 
 

The Bonds are being issued as Current Interest Bonds and Capital Appreciation Bonds, 
each as described below.  The Bonds mature in the years and in the amounts and bear interest 
at  the  rates  per  annum  all  as  set  forth  on  the  inside  cover  page  hereof.    Interest  shall  be 
computed  based  on  a  360-day  year  of  twelve  30-day  months.    The  Bonds  will  be  issued  in 
book-entry form only, and will be initially issued and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as 
nominee for DTC. Purchasers will not receive physical certificates representing their interest in 
the Bonds. See “Book-Entry Only System” below and “APPENDIX F – DTC and the Book-Entry 
Only System.”

Interest  Bonds  shall  be 

Interest  Bonds.  The  Current 

the 
denomination of $5,000 principal amount each or any integral multiple thereof. Interest on the 
Current Interest Bonds is payable semiannually on each February 1 and August 1, commencing 
February 1, 2015 (each, an “Interest Payment Date”).  Each Current Interest Bond will bear 
interest  from  the  Interest  Payment  Date  next  preceding  the  date  of  registration  and 
authentication  thereof  unless  (i)  it  is  authenticated  as  of  an  Interest  Payment  Date,  in  which 
event it will bear interest from such date, or (ii) it is authenticated prior to an Interest Payment 
Date  and  after  the  close  of  business  on  the  fifteenth  (15th)  day  of  the  month  preceding  the 
Interest  Payment  Date  (the  “Record  Date”),  in  which  event  it  will  bear  interest  from  such 
Interest Payment Date, or (iii) it is authenticated prior to January 15, 2015, in which event it will 
bear interest from the Closing Date identified on the cover page hereof.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing,  if  interest  on  any  Current  Interest  Bond  is  in  default  at  the  time  of  authentication 
thereof, such Current Interest Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date to which 
interest has previously been paid or made available for payment thereon.  Payments of principal 
of  and  interest  on  the  Current  Interest  Bonds  will  be  paid  by  the  Paying  Agent  to  DTC  for 
subsequent  disbursement  to  DTC  Participants  who  will  remit  such  payments  to  the  beneficial 
owners of the Current Interest Bonds. 

 
Capital  Appreciation  Bonds.  The  Capital  Appreciation  Bonds  are  dated  the  date  of 
delivery, and accrete interest from such date. The Capital Appreciation Bonds are issuable in 
denominations  of  $5,000  Maturity  Value  (defined  below)  or  any  integral  multiple  thereof.  The 
Capital  Appreciation  Bonds  are  payable  only  at  maturity  (unless  redeemed  prior  to  maturity 
pursuant to the redemption provisions described herein), according to the amounts set forth in 
the accreted value table.  See “APPENDIX G - Table of Accreted Values.” 

 
The  Capital  Appreciation  Bonds  do  not  bear  current  interest,  but  accrete  in  value, 
compounded on each February 1 and August 1, commencing on February 1, 2015, to maturity, 
from their original principal amounts (the “Denominational Amount”) on the date of delivery 
thereof to their stated value at maturity thereof (the “Maturity Value”). See “APPENDIX G – 
Table of Accreted Values.” 

 
The  interest  portion  of  the  Maturity  Value  of  any  Capital  Appreciation  Bond  which  is 
payable on the date of maturity shall represent interest accrued and coming due on such date. 
The  Maturity  Value  of  any  Capital  Appreciation  Bond  at  maturity  shall  be  payable  by  check 
mailed by first-class mail, in lawful money of the United State of America upon presentation and 
surrender of such Capital Appreciation Bond at the Office of the Paying Agent. 

 
See  the  maturity  schedules  on  the  inside  cover  page  of  this  Official  Statement  and 

“DEBT SERVICE SCHEDULE” herein.

Paying Agent 
 

Pursuant  to  the  Bond  Resolution,  the  District  has  appointed  The  Bank  of  New  York 
Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as the registrar, transfer agent, and paying agent for the Bonds 
(the “Paying Agent”).  As long as DTC is the registered owner of the Bonds and DTC’s book-
entry method is used for the Bonds, the Paying Agent will send any notices to owners only to 
DTC.  Any failure of DTC to advise any DTC Participant, or of any DTC Participant to notify any 
Beneficial  Owner,  of  any  such  notice  and  its  content  or  effect  will  not  affect  the  validity  or 
sufficiency of the proceedings relating to any action covered by such notice.  The Paying Agent, 
the District and the Underwriter of the Bonds have no responsibility or liability for any aspects of 
the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership, or for maintaining, 
supervising or reviewing any records relating to beneficial ownership, of interests in the Bonds. 
 
Optional Redemption  

 
Current  Interest  Bonds.    The  Current  Interest  Bonds  maturing  on  or  after  August  1, 
2025 are subject to redemption prior to maturity, at the option of the District, in whole or in part 
among  maturities  on  such  basis  as  shall  be  designated  by  the  District  and  by  lot  within  a 
maturity, from any available source of funds, on August 1, 2024, or on any date thereafter, at a 
price  equal  to  100%  of  the  principal  amount  thereof,  without  premium,  together  with  accrued 
interest thereon to the redemption date. 

 
Capital  Appreciation  Bonds.    The  Capital  Appreciation  Bonds  maturing  on  or  after 
August 1, 2025 are subject to redemption prior to maturity, at the option of the District, in whole 
or in part among maturities on such basis as shall be designated by the District and by lot within 
a maturity, from any available source of funds, on August 1, 2024, or on any date thereafter, at 
a price equal to 100% of the Accreted Value thereof. 

 
Selection  of  Bonds  for  Purpose  of  Redemption.    For  the  purpose  of  selection  for 
optional  redemption,  Bonds  will  be  deemed  to  consist  of  $5,000  portions  (principal  amount, 
Maturity  Value  or  Conversion  Value,  as  applicable),  and  any  such  portion  may  be  separately 
redeemed. Whenever less than all of the outstanding Bonds of any one maturity are designated 
for  redemption,  the  Paying  Agent  shall  select  the  outstanding  Bonds  of  such  maturity  to  be 
redeemed  by  lot  in  any  manner  deemed  fair  by  the  Paying  Agent.    For  purposes  of  such 
selection, each Bond will be deemed to consist of individual bonds of $5,000 portions (principal 
amount, Maturity Value or Conversion Value, as applicable).  The Bonds may all be separately 
redeemed. 

Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption 

 
The Current Interest Bonds maturing on August 1, 2042 (the “Term Bonds”) are subject 
to mandatory sinking fund redemption in part by lot, on August 1 of each year in accordance 
with the schedule set forth below. The Current Interest Bonds so called for mandatory sinking 
fund  redemption  shall  be  redeemed  at  the  principal  amount  of  such  Term  Bonds  to  be 
redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest, without premium.

payments on a pro rata basis in integral multiples of $5,000 principal amount (or on such other 
basis  as  the  District  may  determine)  as  set  forth  in  written  notice  given  by  the  District  to  the 
Paying Agent.

Notice of Redemption 
 

 

 

 

 

The Paying Agent, at the direction of the District, shall cause notice of any redemption to 
be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior 
to  the  date  fixed  for  redemption,  to  the  respective  owners  of  any  Bonds  designated  for 
redemption, at their addresses appearing on the Registration Books; but such mailing shall not 
be a condition precedent to such redemption and failure to mail or to receive any such notice 
shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of such Bonds. Notice of any 
redemption of Bonds shall specify: (a) the Bonds or designated portions thereof (in the case of 
redemption  of  the  Bonds  in  part  but  not  in  whole)  which  are  to  be  redeemed,  (b)  the  date  of 
redemption, (c) the place or places where the redemption will be made, including the name and 
address of the Paying Agent, (d) the redemption price, (e) the CUSIP numbers assigned to the 
Bonds to be redeemed, (f) the Bond numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed in whole or in part 
and, in the case of any Bond to be redeemed in part only, the principal amount of such Bond to 
be  redeemed,  and  (g)  the  original  issue  date,  interest  rate  and  stated  maturity  date  of  each 
Bond to be redeemed in whole or in part.  Such notice shall further state that on the specified 
date there shall become due and payable upon each Bond or portion thereof being redeemed 
the redemption price thereof, and that from and after such date, interest thereon shall cease to 
accrue. 
 
Neither failure to receive or failure to send any notice of redemption nor any defect in 
any  such  redemption  notice  so  given  shall  affect  the  sufficiency  of  the  proceedings  for  the 
redemption of the affected Bonds. 

Right to Rescind Notice of Redemption 

 
The District has the right to rescind any notice of the optional redemption of Bonds by 
written notice to the Paying Agent on or prior to the dated fixed for redemption.  Any notice of 
redemption  shall  be  cancelled  and  annulled  if  for  any  reason  funds  will  not  be  or  are  not 
available on the date fixed for redemption for the payment in full of the Bonds then called for 
redemption.  The District and the Paying Agent have no liability to the Bond owners or any other 
party  related  to  or  arising  from  such  rescission  of  redemption.    The  Paying  Agent  shall  mail 
notice of such rescission of redemption in the same manner as the original notice of redemption 
was sent under the Bond Resolution. 

-6- 

 

Partial Redemption of Bonds 
 

Upon the surrender of any Bond redeemed in part only, the Paying Agent shall execute 
and  deliver  to  the  Owner  thereof  a  new  Bond  or  Bonds  of  like  tenor  and  maturity  and  of 
authorized  denominations  equal  in  transfer  amounts  to  the  unredeemed  portion  of  the  Bond 
surrendered.  Such partial redemption shall be valid upon payment of the amount required to be 
paid  to  such  Owner,  and  the  County  and  the  District  shall  be  released  and  discharged 
thereupon from all liability to the extent of such payment. 
 
Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Bonds 
 

If  the  book-entry  system  is  discontinued,  the  District  shall  cause  the  Paying  Agent  to 
maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and records necessary for the 
registration,  exchange  and  transfer  of  the  Bonds,  and  the  person  in  whose  name  a  Bond  is 
registered on the Bond Register shall be regarded as the absolute owner of that Bond. Payment 
of  the  principal  of  and  interest  on  any  Bond  shall  be  made  only  to  or  upon  the  order  of  that 
person; neither the District nor the Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary, 
but the registration may be changed as provided in the Bond Resolution. 

 
Any  Bond  may,  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  be  transferred,  upon  the  Registration 
Books,  by  the  person  in  whose  name  it  is  registered,  in  person  or  by  his  duly  authorized 
attorney,  upon  surrender  of  such  Bond  for  cancellation  at  the  Office  at  the  Paying  Agent, 
accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer in a form approved by the Paying 
Agent,  duly  executed.  The  Paying  Agent  shall  require  the  payment  by  the  Owner  requesting 
such transfer of any tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such 
transfer.    Whenever  any  Bond  is  surrendered  for  transfer,  the  District  shall  execute  and  the 
Paying Agent shall authenticate and deliver a new Bond, for like aggregate principal amount. 

 
Bonds may be exchanged at the Office of the Paying Agent for a like aggregate principal 
amount  of  Bonds  of  authorized  denominations  and  of  the  same  maturity.    The  Paying  Agent 
shall  require  the  payment  by  the  Owner  requesting  such  exchange  of  any  tax  or  other 
governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such exchange.  

Defeasance of Bonds 

 
Any or all of the Bonds may be paid by the District in any of the following ways, provided 
that  the  District  also  pays  or  causes  to  be  paid  any  other  sums  payable  under  the  Bond 
Resolution by the District: 

 

 
(i) 

 
(ii) 

by paying or causing to be paid the principal of and interest on such Bonds, 
as and when the same become due and payable; 

by irrevocably depositing, in trust, at or before maturity, money or securities 
in  the  necessary  amount  (as  provided  in  the  Bond  Resolution)  to  pay  or 
redeem such Bonds; or 

 
(iii)  by delivering such Bonds to the Paying Agent for cancellation by it. 
 
If the District pays all outstanding Bonds and also pays or causes to be paid all other 
sums payable under the Bond Resolution by the District, then and in that case, at the election of 
the District, and notwithstanding that any Bonds have not been surrendered for payment, the 

-7- 

 

 
 

 

Bond  Resolution  and  other  assets  made  under  the  Bond  Resolution  and  all  covenants, 
agreements  and  other  obligations  of  the  District  under  the  Bond  Resolution  shall  cease, 
terminate, become void and be completely discharged and satisfied, except only that, upon a 
deposit  in  trust  prior  to  maturity  of  money  or  securities  in  the  amount  to  pay  the  Bonds,  the 
District shall remain liable for payment of such amount, but only out of such money or securities 
deposited with the Paying Agent for such payment.

APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF BONDS 

 

Building Fund 
 

Pursuant to the Bond Resolution, the County will create and maintain a fund known as 
the  “2012  Election,  Series  B  Building  Fund”  (the  “Building  Fund”),  to  be  maintained  by  the 
County Treasurer-Tax Collector (the “County Treasurer”), into which the County Treasurer will 
deposit the proceeds from the sale of the Bonds.  The County Treasurer will maintain separate 
accounting for the proceeds of the Bonds, including all earnings received from the investment 
thereof.  Amounts credited to the Building Fund for the Bonds will be expended by the District 
solely for the financing of projects for which the Bond proceeds are authorized to be expended 
under  the  Authorization,  and  for  payment  of  costs  of  issuance,  if  any.    See  “THE  BONDS  – 
Purpose of Issue” herein.  All interest and other gain arising from the investment of proceeds of 
the Bonds will be retained in the Building Fund and used for the purposes thereof.  At the written 
request of the District filed with the County Treasurer, any amounts remaining on deposit in the 
Building  Fund  and  not  needed  for  the  purposes  thereof  shall  be  withdrawn  from  the  Building 
Fund  and  transferred  to  the  Debt  Service  Fund  (defined  below),  to  be  applied  to  pay  the 
principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds.    If  excess  amounts  remain  on  deposit  in  the  Building 
Fund after payment in full of the Bonds, any such excess amounts shall be transferred to the 
general  fund  of  the  District,  to  be  applied  for  the  purposes  for  which  the  Bonds  have  been 
authorized  or  otherwise  in  accordance  with  the  Bond  Law.    The  County  has  no  obligation 
regarding the use or application of the proceeds of the Bonds. 

Debt Service Fund 
 

The accrued interest and any premium, if any, received by the County from the sale of 
the  Bonds  will  be  deposited  in  a  separate  fund  known  as  the  “2012  Election,  Series  B  Debt 
Service Fund” (the “Debt Service Fund”), together with the collections of ad valorem taxes, will 
be  used  only  for  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds.  Interest  earnings  on  the 

-10- 

investment of monies held in the Debt Service Fund will be retained in the Debt Service Fund 
and used by the County to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due. The Debt 
Service Fund will be maintained by the County Treasurer as a separate account, distinct from all 
other funds of the District.   

 
Amounts in the Debt Service Fund will be transferred by the County to the Paying Agent 
to  the  extent  required  to  pay  principal  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  when  due.    In  addition, 
amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Fund will be applied to pay the fees and expenses of 
the Paying Agent insofar as permitted by law. 

 
If, after payment in full of the Bonds, any amounts remain on deposit in the Debt Service 
Fund, the County shall transfer such amounts to the general fund of the District as provided in 
Section 15234 of the Education Code of the State. 

Investment of Proceeds of Bonds 
 

All moneys held in any of the funds or accounts established with the County under the 
Bond Resolution will be invested in any one or more investments generally permitted to school 
districts  under  the  laws  of  the  State,  consistent  with  the  County’s  current  investment  policy.  
Such  investments  will  be  made  under  the  direction  and  at  the  discretion  of  the  County 
Treasurer.  Obligations purchased as an investment of moneys in any fund or account constitute 
a part of such fund or account.  All interest or gain derived from the investment of amounts in 
any  of  the  funds  or  accounts  established  under  the  Bond  Resolution  will  be  deposited  in  the 
fund or account from which such investment was made, and will be expended for the purposes 
thereof. See “COUNTY INVESTMENT POOL” herein. 

 

SECURITY FOR THE BONDS 

 
General 
 

 

 

 

 

The  Board  of  Supervisors  of  the  County  has  the  power  and  is  obligated  to  levy  ad 
valorem taxes for the payment of the Bonds and the interest accreting thereon upon all property 
within  the  District  subject  to  taxation  by  the  District  without  limitation  as  to  rate  or  amount 
(except certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates).  Such taxes are required to 
be  levied  annually,  in  addition  to  all  other  taxes,  during  the  period  that  the  Bonds  are 
outstanding in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due.  
Such taxes, when collected, will be deposited into the Debt Service Fund for the Bonds, which is 
maintained by the County and which is created by statute for the payment of the principal of and 
interest on the Bonds when due.  Although the County is obligated to levy an ad valorem 
tax for the payment of the Bonds, and will maintain the Debt Service Fund pledged to the 
repayment of the Bonds, the Bonds are not a debt of the County. 

 
The moneys in the Debt Service Fund, to the extent necessary to pay the principal and 
interest on the Bonds as the same become due and payable, shall be transferred by the County 
to the Paying Agent which, in turn, shall pay such moneys to DTC to pay the principal of and 
interest on the Bonds.  DTC will thereupon make payments of the principal of and interest on 
the Bonds to the DTC Participants who will thereupon make payments of such principal of and 
interest  on  the  Bonds  to  the  beneficial  owners  of  the  Bonds.    See  “APPENDIX  F  –  BOOK-
ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM.”   

-11- 

 

The amount of the annual ad valorem tax levied by the County to repay the Bonds will 
be  determined  by  the  relationship  between  the  assessed  valuation  of  taxable  property  in  the 
District  and  the  amount  of  debt  service  due  on  the  Bonds.    A  reduction  in  the  assessed 
valuation  of  taxable  property  in  the  District  caused  by  economic  factors  beyond  the  District’s 
control, such as economic recession, slower growth, or deflation of land values, a relocation out 
of the District by one or more major property owners, or the complete or partial destruction of 
such  property  caused  by,  among  other  eventualities,  an  earthquake,  flood  or  other  natural 
disaster,  could  cause  a  reduction  in  the  assessed  value  of  the  District  and  necessitate  an 
unanticipated increase in the annual tax levy.  
 
Ad Valorem Property Taxation 
 

Taxes  are  levied  by  the  County  for  each  fiscal  year  on  taxable  real  and  personal 
property which is situated in the District as of the preceding January 1.  For assessment and 
collection  purposes,  property  is  classified  either  as  “secured”  or  “unsecured”  and  is  listed 
accordingly  on  separate  parts  of  the  assessment  roll.    The  “secured  roll”  is  that  part  of  the 
assessment  roll  containing  State-assessed  public  utilities  property  and  real  property  having  a 
tax  lien  which  is  sufficient,  in  the  opinion  of  the  County  Assessor,  to  secure  payment  of  the 
taxes.  Other property is assessed on the “unsecured roll.” 

 
Property  taxes  on  the  secured  roll  are  due  in  two  installments,  on  November  1  and 
February 1 of each fiscal year.  If unpaid, such taxes become delinquent on December 10 and 
April 10, respectively, and a 10% penalty attaches to any delinquent payment.  Property on the 
secured roll with respect to which taxes are delinquent becomes tax defaulted on or about June 
30 of the fiscal year.  Such property may thereafter be redeemed by payment of a penalty of 
1.5% per month to the time of redemption, plus costs and a redemption fee.  If taxes are unpaid 
for  a  period  of  five  years  or  more,  the  property  is  subject  to  sale  by  the  Tax  Collector  and 
Treasurer. 

 
Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due as of the January 1 lien date and become 
delinquent, if unpaid, on August 31.  A 10% penalty attaches to delinquent unsecured taxes.  If 
unsecured taxes are unpaid by 5:00 p.m. on October 31, an additional penalty of 1.5% attaches 
to  them  on  the  first  day  of  each  month  until  paid.    The  taxing  authority  has  four  ways  of 
collecting delinquent unsecured personal property taxes:  (1) bringing a civil action against the 
taxpayer; (2) filing a certificate in the office of the County Clerk specifying certain facts in order 
to  obtain  a  lien  on  certain  property  of  the  taxpayer;  (3)  filing  a  certificate  of  delinquency  for 
record  in  the  County  Clerk  and  County  Recorder’s  office  in  order  to  obtain  a  lien  on  certain 
property  of  the  taxpayer;  and  (4)  seizing  and  selling  personal  property,  improvements,  or 
possessory interests belonging or assessed to the assessee. 

 

Assessed Valuations 
 

The assessed valuation of property in the District is established by the County Assessor, 
except  for  public  utility  property  which  is  assessed  by  the  State  Board  of  Equalization.  
Assessed valuations are reported at 100% of the “full value” of the property, as defined in Article 
XIIIA of the California Constitution.  The full value may be adjusted annually to reflect inflation at 
a  rate  not  to  exceed  2%  per  year,  or  to  reflect  a  reduction  in  the  consumer  price  index  or 
comparable  data  for  the  area,  or  to  reflect  declines  in  property  value  caused  by  substantial 
damage,  destruction  or  other  factors,  including  assessment  appeals  filed  by  property  owners. 
For  a  discussion  of  how  properties  currently  are  assessed,  see  “APPENDIX  A  –  DISTRICT 
GENERAL AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION.”

Certain  classes  of  property,  such  as  churches,  colleges,  not-for-profit  hospitals,  and 

charitable institutions, are exempt from property taxation and do not appear on the tax rolls.   

 
Property within the District had a taxable assessed valuation for fiscal year 2014-15 of 
$1,624,062,190.  Shown in the following table are the assessed valuations for the District from

There are two types of appeals of assessed values that could adversely impact property 

Appeals of Assessed Value 

tax revenues within the District. 
 

One type of assessed valuation appeal is based on the provisions of Article XIIIA of the 
California  Constitution,  which  was  amended  with  the  passage  of  Proposition  8  in  November 
1978,  and  is  known  as  a  “Proposition  8  Appeal.”  Under  Article  XIIIA,  for  each  January  1  lien 
date,  the  taxable  value  of  real  property  must  be  the  lesser  of  its  base  year  value,  annually 
adjusted by the inflation factor pursuant to Article XIIIA of the State Constitution, or its full cash 
value,  taking  into  account  reductions  in  value  due  to  damage,  destruction,  depreciation, 
obsolescence,  removal  of  property  or  other  factors  causing  a  decline  in  value.    See 
“CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT  REVENUES 
AND APPROPRIATIONS” in Appendix A.  
 

Under  California  law,  property  owners  may  apply  for  a  reduction  of  their  property  tax 
assessment by filing a written application, in form prescribed by the State Board of Equalization, 
with the County board of equalization or assessment appeals board.  In most cases, the appeal

is filed because the applicant believes that present market conditions (such as residential home 
prices)  cause  the  property  to  be  worth  less  than  its  current  assessed  value.    Proposition  8 
reductions may also be unilaterally applied by the County Assessor. 
 

Any reduction in the assessment ultimately granted as a result of such appeal applies to 
the year for which application is made and during which the written application was filed.  These 
reductions are subject to yearly reappraisals and are adjusted back to their original values when 
market  conditions  improve.    Once  the  property  has  regained  its  prior  value,  adjusted  for 
inflation,  it  once  again  is  subject  to  the  annual  inflationary  factor  growth  rate  allowed  under 
Article  XIIIA.    See  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING 
DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS” in Appendix A hereto. 
 

A second type of assessment appeal involves a challenge to the base year value of an 
assessed  property.    Appeals  for  reduction  in  the  base  year  value  of  an  assessment,  if 
successful, reduce the assessment for the year in which the appeal is taken and prospectively 
thereafter.  The base year is determined by the completion date of new construction or the date 
of change of ownership.  Any base year appeal must be made within four years of the change of 
ownership or new construction date.  
 

The  District  cannot  predict  the  changes  in  assessed  values  that  might  result  from 
pending or future appeals by taxpayers.  Any reduction in aggregate District assessed valuation 
due to appeals, as with any reduction in assessed valuation due to other causes, will cause the 
tax rate levied to repay the Bonds to increase accordingly, so that the fixed debt service on the 
Bonds (and other outstanding general obligation bonds of the District) may be paid. 

Property Tax Collections 
 

The  Board  of  Supervisors  of  the  County  has  adopted  the  Alternative  Method  of 
Distribution  of  Tax  Levies  and  Collections  and  of  Tax  Sale  Proceeds  (the  "Teeter  Plan"),  as 
provided  for  in  Section  4701  et  seq.  of  the  California  Revenue  and  Taxation  Code,  "to 
accomplish  a  simplification  of  the  tax-levying  and  tax  apportioning  process  and  an  increased 
flexibility in the use of available cash resources."  This alternative method is used for distribution 
of the ad valorem property tax revenues. 

 
The County will be responsible for determining the amount of the ad valorem tax levy on 
each parcel in the District, which will be entered onto the secured real property tax roll.  Upon 
completion of the secured real property tax roll, the County Auditor determines the total amount 
of taxes and assessments actually extended on the roll for each fund for which a tax levy has 
been  included,  and  apportions  100%  of  the  tax  and  assessment  levies  to  that  fund's  credit.  
Such monies may thereafter be drawn against by the taxing agency in the same manner as if 
the amount credited had been collected. 

 
The  Teeter  Plan  is  to  remain  in  effect  unless  the  Board  of  Supervisors  orders  its 
discontinuance or unless, prior to the commencement of any fiscal year of the County (which 
commences on July 1), the Board of Supervisors shall receive a petition for its discontinuance 
joined in by resolutions adopted by two thirds of the participating revenue districts in the County, 
in which event the Board of Supervisors is to order discontinuance of the Teeter Plan effective 
at the commencement of the subsequent fiscal year.  In addition, the Board of Supervisors may, 
by resolution adopted not later than July 15 of the fiscal year for which it is to apply after holding 
a public hearing on the matter, discontinue the procedures under the Teeter Plan with respect to 
any  tax  levying  agency  or  assessment  levying  agency  in  the  County  if  the  rate  of  secure  tax 

-16- 

 

delinquency in that agency in any year exceeds 3% of the total of all taxes and assessments 
levied on the secured rolls for that agency. 

 
So  long  as  the  Teeter  Plan  remains  in  effect  with  respect  to  the  District,  the  District's 
receipt of revenues with respect to the levy of ad valorem property taxes will not be dependent 
upon actual collections of the ad valorem property taxes by the County.  In the event that the 
Teeter Plan were terminated, the amount of the levy of ad valorem taxes in the District would 
depend  upon  the  collections  of  the  ad  valorem  property  taxes  and  delinquency  rates 
experienced with respect to the parcels within the District. 
 
Overlapping Debt Obligations 
 

Set  forth  on  the  following  page  is  a  direct  and  overlapping  debt  report  (the  "Debt 
Report") prepared by California Municipal Statistics, Inc. for debt issued as of August 1, 2014.  
The  Debt  Report  is  included  for  general  information  purposes  only.    The  District  has  not 
reviewed  the  Debt  Report  for  completeness  or  accuracy  and  makes  no  representation  in 
connection therewith. 

 
The  Debt  Report  generally  includes  long-term  obligations  sold  in  the  public  credit 
markets by public agencies whose boundaries overlap the boundaries of the District in whole or 
in  part.    Such  long-term  obligations  generally  are  not  payable  from  revenues  of  the  District 
(except as indicated) nor are they necessarily obligations secured by land within the District.  In 
many cases, long-term obligations issued by a public agency are payable only from the general 
fund or other revenues of such public agency. 

 
The contents of the Debt Report are as follows: (1) the first column indicates the public 
agencies which have outstanding debt as of the date of the Debt Report and whose territory 
overlaps the District; (2) the second column shows the percentage of the assessed valuation of 
the overlapping public agency identified in column 1 which is represented by property located 
within the District; and (3) the third column is an apportionment of the dollar amount of each 
public agency’s outstanding debt (which amount is not shown in the table) to property in the 
District,  as  determined  by  multiplying  the  total  outstanding  debt  of  each  agency  by  the 
percentage of the District’s assessed valuation represented in column 2.

COUNTY INVESTMENT POOL 

 

Under the California Education Code, the District is required to pay all monies received 
from  any  source  into  the  County  of  Sonoma  Treasury  to  be  held  on  behalf  of  the  District.  
Therefore, the District’s funds, including monies in the Debt Service Fund and Building Fund, 
will be held by the County Treasurer.   

 
The  County  Treasurer  manages  the  County’s  investment  pool  (the “County Pool”)  in 
which certain funds of the County and certain funds of other participating entities are invested 
pending  disbursement.    Amounts  held  for  the  County,  school  districts  and  special  districts 
located  within  the  County  constitute  approximately  99%  of  the  County  Pool.    The  County 
Treasurer  is  ex-officio  treasurer  of  each  of  these  participating  entities,  which  therefore  are 
legally required to deposit their cash receipts and revenues in the County treasury.  Under State 
law, withdrawals are allowed only to pay for expenses which have become due.

LEGAL OPINION 

TAX MATTERS 

 

 

-21- 

 
 

 
 

The  proceedings  in  connection  with  the  issuance  of  the  Bonds  are  subject  to  the 
approval  as  to  their  legality  by  Bond  Counsel  for  the  District.    A  copy  of  the  legal  opinion, 
certified by the official in whose office the original is filed, will be printed on each Bond.  Certain 
legal  matters  will  also  be  passed  upon  for  the  District  by  Disclosure  Counsel,  and  for  the 
Underwriter  by  Underwriter’s  Counsel.    The  fees  of  Bond  Counsel,  Disclosure  Counsel  and 
Underwriter’s Counsel are contingent upon the issuance and delivery of the Bonds. 

Federal Tax Status.  In the opinion of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, San 
Francisco,  California,  Bond  Counsel,  subject,  however  to  the  qualifications  set  forth  below, 
under existing law, the interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income 
tax  purposes,  and  such  interest  is  not  an  item  of  tax  preference  for  purposes  of  the  federal 
alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations, although for the purposes of 
computing the alternative minimum tax imposed on certain corporations, such interest is taken 
into  account  in  determining  certain  income  and  earnings,  and  the  Bonds  are  “qualified  tax-
exempt  obligations”  within  the  meaning  of  Section  265(b)(3)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of 
1986, as amended (the “Tax Code”).  

 
The opinions set forth in the preceding paragraph are subject to the condition that the 
District comply with all requirements of the Tax Code that must be satisfied subsequent to the 
issuance  of  the  Bonds  in  order  that  such  interest  be,  or  continue  to  be,  excluded  from  gross 
income for federal income tax purposes.  The District has covenanted to comply with each such 
requirement.  Failure to comply with certain of such requirements may cause the inclusion of 

such interest in gross income for federal income tax purposes to be retroactive to the date of 
issuance of the Bonds.  

 
Tax Treatment of Original Issue Discount and Premium.  If the initial offering price to 
the public (excluding bond houses and brokers) at which a Bond is sold is less than the amount 
payable  at  maturity  thereof,  then  such  difference  constitutes  “original  issue  discount”  for 
purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income taxes.  If the initial 
offering price to the public (excluding bond houses and brokers) at which each Bond is sold is 
greater than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference constitutes “original 
issue premium” for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income 
taxes. De minimis original issue discount is disregarded.  

 
Under the Tax Code, original issue discount is treated as interest excluded from federal 
gross income and exempt from State of California personal income taxes to the extent properly 
allocable to each owner thereof subject to the limitations described in the first paragraph of this 
section. The original issue discount accrues over the term to maturity of the Bond on the basis 
of  a  constant  interest  rate  compounded  on  each  interest  or  principal  payment  date  (with 
straightline interpolations between compounding dates). The amount of original issue discount 
accruing during each period is added to the adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable 
gain  upon  disposition  (including  sale  or  payment  on  maturity)  of  such  Bond.    The  Tax  Code 
contains  certain  provisions  relating  to  the  accrual  of  original  issue  discount  in  the  case  of 
purchasers  of  the  Bonds  who  purchase  the  Bonds  after  the  initial  offering  of  a  substantial 
amount  of  such  maturity.  Owners  of  such  Bonds  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  with 
respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Bonds with original issue discount, including 
the  treatment  of  purchasers  who  do  not  purchase  in  the  original  offering,  the  allowance  of  a 
deduction for any loss on a sale or other disposition, and the treatment of accrued original issue 
discount on such Bonds under federal individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes. 

 
Under the Tax Code, original issue premium is amortized on an annual basis over the 
term of the Bond (said term being the shorter of the Bond’s maturity date or its call date). The 
amount of original issue premium amortized each year reduces the adjusted basis of the owner 
of the Bond for purposes of determining taxable gain or loss upon disposition. The amount of 
original issue premium on a Bond is amortized each year over the term to maturity of the Bond 
on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date 
(with straightline interpolations between compounding dates). Amortized Bond premium is not 
deductible  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  Owners  of  Premium  Bonds,  including  purchasers 
who do not purchase in the original offering, should consult their own tax advisors with respect 
to State of California personal income tax and federal income tax consequences of owning such 
Bonds. 
 
California Tax Status.  In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is 

 

 
 

exempt from California personal income taxes. 

 
Other  Tax  Considerations.    Owners  of  the  Bonds  should  also  be  aware  that  the 
ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may have federal 
or state tax consequences other than as described above. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion 
regarding any federal or state tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds other than as 
expressly described above. 

-22- 

 

 
 

 

Standard  &  Poor’s  Ratings  Services,  a  Standard  &  Poor’s  Financial  Services  LLC 
business (“S&P”) is expected to assign its rating of “AA” to the Bonds, with the understanding 
that  BAM  will  issue  the  Policy  with  respect  to  the  Bonds  at  closing.    In  addition,  S&P  has 
assigned an underlying rating of “A+” to the Bonds.  The District has provided certain additional 
information and materials to S&P (some of which does not appear in this Official Statement).  
Such rating reflects only the view of S&P and an explanation of the significance of such rating 
outlook may be obtained only from S&P.  There is no assurance that any credit ratings given to 
the  Bonds  will  be  maintained  for  any  period  of  time  or  that  the  rating  may  not  be  lowered  or 
withdrawn  entirely  by  S&P  if,  in  its  judgment,  circumstances  so  warrant.  Any  such  downward 
revision  or  withdrawal  of  such  rating  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  market  price  of  the 
Bonds.  
 
 

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE 

The  District  will  execute  a  Continuing  Disclosure  Certificate  in  connection  with  the 
issuance of the Bonds in the form attached hereto as Appendix E.  The District has covenanted 
therein, for the benefit of holders and beneficial owners of the Bonds to provide certain financial 
information  and  operating  data  relating  to  the  District  to  the  Municipal  Securities  Rulemaking 
Board (an “Annual Report”) not later than nine months after the end of the District’s fiscal year 
(which currently would be March 31), commencing March 31, 2015 with the report for the 2013-
14 Fiscal Year, and to provide notices of the occurrence of certain enumerated events. Such 
notices will be filed by the District with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.  The specific 
nature of the information to be contained in an Annual Report or the notices of material events is 
set  forth  in  “APPENDIX  E  –  FORM  OF  CONTINUING  DISCLOSURE  CERTIFICATE.”  These 
covenants have been made in order to assist the Underwriter of the Bonds in complying with 
S.E.C. Rule 15c2-12(b)(5) (the “Rule”).  

 
In  the  past  five  years,  the  District  failed  to  file  complete  and  timely  annual  reports  in 
2008-09 and 2009-10 with respect to previous undertakings with regard to said Rule to provide 
annual reports or notices of material events. Additionally, the District failed to file material events 
notices regarding bond insurer downgrades. All of such filings have since been made with the 
MSRB and the District is currently in compliance with its prior undertakings under the Rule. 

No  litigation  is  pending  or  threatened  concerning  the  validity  of  the  Bonds,  and  a 
certificate to that effect will be furnished by the District to purchasers at the time of the original 
delivery of the Bonds. The District is not aware of any litigation pending or threatened that (i) 
questions  the  political  existence  of  the  District,  (ii)  contests  the  District’s  ability  to  receive  ad 
valorem taxes or to collect other revenues or (iii) contests the District’s ability to issue, sell and 
retire the Bonds, or the application of the proceeds of the sale thereof.

UNDERWRITING 

George K. Baum & Company (the “Underwriter”) has agreed to purchase the Bonds at 
a  price  of  $5,207,555.16,  which  is  equal  to  the  initial  principal  amount  of  the  Bonds  of 
$4,999,219.20,  plus  original  issue  premium  of  $258,328.15,  less  an  Underwriter’s  discount  of 
$49,992.19.    The  purchase  contract  relating  to  the  Bonds  provides  that  the  Underwriter  will 
purchase all of the Bonds (if any are purchased), and provides that the Underwriter’s obligation 
to  purchase  is  subject  to  certain  terms  and  conditions,  including  the  approval  of  certain  legal 
matters by counsel.  

 
The Underwriter may offer and sell Bonds to certain dealers and others at prices lower 
than  the  offering  prices  stated  on  the  inside  cover  page  hereof.  The  offering  prices  may  be 
changed by the Underwriter.

DISTRICT GENERAL INFORMATION 

General Information 
 

The  District  was  established  as  a  school  district  in  1865.    The  District  is  located  in 
Sonoma County (the “County”) and serves the communities in southwest Santa Rosa between 
West  Third  Street  and  Ludwig  Avenue  (north/south)  and  Stony  Point  and  Merced  Avenues

Employee Relations 
 

For fiscal year 2014-15, the District has budgeted to employ 81.3 certificated and 51.3 
classified employees.  Certificated and classified employees are represented by two bargaining 
agents: the Wright Education Association (the “WEA”), which is the exclusive bargaining agent 
for  all  certificated  non-management  employees  of  the  District,  and  the  California  School 
Employees’  Association  (the  “CSEA”),  which  is  the  bargaining  agent  for  all  classified  or 
uncertificated  personnel  within  the  District.  The  WEA  contract  is  updated  with  an  annual 
memorandum  of  understanding  and  has  not  been  settled  for  fiscal  year  2014-15.  The  CSEA 
contract  expired  on  June  30,  2014  and  has  not  been  settled  for  fiscal  year  2014-15. 
Management and confidential employees are not represented by a bargaining unit.  

District Retirement Systems 
 

Qualified employees are covered under multiple-employer defined benefit pension plans 
maintained by agencies of the State of California.  Certificated employees are members of the 
State  Teachers’  Retirement  System  (“STRS”)  and  classified  employees  are  members  of  the 
Public Employees’ Retirement System (“PERS”). 

 
STRS.    The  District  participates  in  STRS.  This  plan  covers  basically  all  full-time 
certificated employees. Active plan members are required to contribute 8.0% of their salary and 
the District is to contribute an actuarially determined rate, which was 8.25% of payroll for the 
2013-14  fiscal  year.  The  District's  contribution  to  STRS  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  June  30, 
2011, 2012 and 2013 were $410,605, $430,453 and $420,219, respectively (audited figures), for 
the  2013-14  fiscal  year  was  $449,275  (estimated  actual)  and  for  the  2014-15  fiscal  year, 
$554,560 is budgeted.   

 
PERS.  The District also participates in PERS. This plan covers all classified personnel 
who  are  employed  more  than  four  hours  per  day.  Active  plan  members  are  required  to 
contribute  7.0  percent  of  their  salary  and  the  District  is  required  to  contribute  an  actuarially 

A-2 

 

determined rate.  The District's contribution to PERS for fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2012 
and  2013  were  $155,839,  $169,560  and  $172,848,  respectively  (audited  figures),  and  for  the 
2013-14 fiscal year was $174,923 (estimated actual) and for the 2014-15 fiscal year, $200,524is 
budgeted. 

 
Both  the  PERS  and  STRS  systems  are  operated  on  a  statewide  basis.   District 
contribution  rates  to  these  two  retirement  systems  vary  annually  depending  on  changes  in 
actuarial  assumptions  and  other  factors,  such  as  liability.   STRS  has  a  substantial  State 
unfunded liability.  Since this liability has not been broken down by agency, information is not 
available showing the District’s share. 

 
State  Pensions  Trusts.    Both  the  PERS  and  STRS  systems  are  operated  on  a 
statewide basis.  District contribution rates to PERS can vary annually depending on changes in 
actuarial assumptions and other factors, such as liability.  Contributions to STRS can only be 
changed  legislatively.   Both  PERS  and  STRS  have  substantial  State  unfunded  actuarial 
liabilities, being $14.6 billion and $71.0 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2012. 

 
Both  STRS  and  PERS  issue  separate  comprehensive  financial  reports  that  include 
financial  statements  and  required  supplemental  information.    Copies  of  such  reports  may  be 
obtained  from  STRS  and  PERS,  respectively,  as  follows:    (i)  STRS,  P.O.  Box  15275, 
Sacramento,  California  95851-0275;  (ii)  PERS,  P.O.  Box  942703,  Sacramento,  California 
94229-2703.  More  information  regarding  STRS  and  PERS  can  also  be  obtained  at  their 
websites, www.calstrs.com and www.calpers.ca.gov, respectively.  However, information in the 
financial reports and on the websites is not incorporated in this Official Statement by reference.  
See also the following paragraph on recent pension reform legislation. 

 
Pension Reform Act of 2013 (Assembly Bill 340).  On September 12, 2012, Governor 
Brown signed AB 340, a bill that enacted the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act 
of 2013 (“PEPRA”) and amends various sections of the California Education and Government 
Codes.  AB 340 (i) increases the retirement age for new State, school, and city and local agency 
employees  depending  on  job  function,  (ii)  caps  the  annual  PERS  and  STRS  pension  benefit 
payouts,  (iii)  addresses  numerous  abuses  of  the  system,  and  (iv)  requires  State,  school,  and 
certain city and local agency employees to pay at least half of the costs of their PERS pension 
benefits.    PEPRA  applies  to  all  public  employers  except  the  University  of  California,  charter 
cities and charter counties (except to the extent they contract with PERS.) 

 
The provisions of AB 340 went into effect on January 1, 2013 with respect to new State, 
school, and city and local agency employees hired on that date and after; existing employees 
who are members of employee associations, including employee associations of the District, will 
have a five-year window to negotiate compliance with AB 340 through collective bargaining.  If 
no  agreement  is  reached  by  January  1,  2018,  a  city,  public  agency  or  school  district  could 
require employees to pay a portion of the costs of PERS pension benefits. 

 
PERS has predicted that the impact of AB 340 on employers, including the District and 
other  employers  in  the  STRS  system,  and  employees  will  vary,  based  on  each  employer’s 
current level of benefits. To the extent that the new formulas lower retirement benefits, employer 
contribution rates could decrease over time as current employees retire and employees subject 
to the new formulas make up a larger percentage of the workforce. This change would, in some 
circumstances,  result  in  a  lower  retirement  benefit  for  employees  than  they  currently  earn.  
Additionally,  PERS  has  noted  that  changes  arising  from  AB  340  could  ultimately  have  an 

A-3 

adverse  impact  on  public  sector  recruitment  in  areas  that  have  historically  experienced 
recruitment challenges due to higher pay for similar jobs in the private sector. 

 
With respect to STRS, for employees hired after January 1, 2013, future members will 
pay the greater of either (1) at least 50% of the normal cost of their retirement plan, rounded to 
the  nearest  one-quarter  percent,  or  (2)  the  contribution  rate  paid  by  current  members.  The 
member  contribution  rate  could  be  increased  from  this  level  through  collective  bargaining  or 
may be adjusted base don other factors.  Public employers will pay at least the normal cost rate, 
after  subtracting  the  member’s  contribution.    The  District  is  unable  to  predict  the  amount  of 
future contributions it will have to make to STRS as a result of the implementation of AB 340 
(being  its  future  contributions  for  the  normal  costs  of  new  employees),  and  as  a  result  of 
negotiations  with  its  employee  associations,  or,  notwithstanding  the  adoption  of  AB  340, 
resulting  from  any  legislative  changes  regarding  STRS  employer  contributions  that  may  be 
adopted in the future. 

 
More  information  about  AB  340  can  be  accessed  through  the  PERS’s  web  site  at 
www.calpers.ca.gov/index.jsp?bc=/member/retirement/pension-reform-impacts.xml&pst=ACT& 
pca=ST  and  through  the  STRS  web  site  at  http://www.calstrs.com/Newsroom/whats_new/ 
AB340_detailed_impact_analysis.pdf.  The references to these internet websites are shown for 
reference  and  convenience  only;  the  information  contained  within  the  websites  may  not  be 
current and has not been reviewed by the District and is not incorporated herein by reference. 

Insurance 

 
The  District  participates  in  two  joint  ventures  under  joint  powers  agreements  with  the 
Redwood Empire Schools’ Insurance Group for property and liability and workers’ compensation 
insurance coverage and West County Transportation Agency for pupil transportation services. 
The  relationship  between  the  District  and  the  JPAs  is  such  that  the  JPAs  are  not  component 
units of the District for financial reporting purposes.  

 
The JPAs arrange for and provide for coverage or services for its members. Each JPA is 
governed  by  a  board  consisting  of  a  representative  from  each  member  district.  Each  board 
controls the operations, including selection of management and approval of operating budgets, 
independent of any influence by the member districts beyond their representation on the board. 
Each member district pays a premium commensurate with the level of coverage requested and 
shares surpluses and deficits proportionate to its participation in each JPA.

DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

 

The  information  in  this  and  other  sections  concerning  the  District's  operations  and 
operating budget is provided as supplementary information only, and it should not be inferred 
from the inclusion of this information in this Official Statement that the principal and interest of 
the Bonds is payable from the General Fund of the District.  The Bonds are payable from the 
proceeds of an ad valorem tax required to be levied by the County in an amount sufficient for 
the payment thereof. 

Accounting Practices 
 

The  accounting  practices  of  the  District  conform  to  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles  in  accordance  with  policies  and  procedures  of  the  California  School  Accounting 
Manual.  This manual, according to Section 41010 of the California Education Code, is to be 
followed by all California school districts. 

 
The financial resources of the District are divided into separate funds for which separate 
accounts  are  maintained  for  recording  cash,  other  resources  and  all  related  liabilities, 
obligations and equities.  The major fund classification is the general fund which accounts for all 
financial resources not required to be accounted for in another fund.  The District’s fiscal year 
begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. 

 
All governmental funds and fiduciary funds are maintained on the modified accrual basis 
of  accounting.    As  such,  revenues  are  recognized  when  they  become  susceptible  to  accrual, 
that is, both measurable and available to finance expenditures for the current period.  For more 
information  on  the  District’s  accounting  method,  see  Note  1,  Section  B  of  “APPENDIX  B  –
AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE DISTRICT FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 
30, 2013” attached hereto.

Reserve  Levels.    The  District  has  successfully  maintained  its  reserve  for  economic 
uncertainties  above  the  State  requirement,  with  its  unrestricted  general  fund  balance  being 
5.1% in fiscal year 2011-12, 4.10% in fiscal year 2012-13, 5.00% in fiscal year 2013-14, and for 
fiscal year 2014-15, 7.88% is budgeted. 

 
In connection with the State’s fiscal year 2014-15 Budget, a constitutional amendment 
will be presented to State voters at the November 4, 2014 general election. See APPENDIX A 
herein under the heading “2014-15 Adopted State Budget.” The amendment would establish a 
rainy  day  fund  at  the  State  level,  as  well  as  a  Proposition  98  reserve  to  attempt  to  minimize 
large fluctuations from year to year in the State’s education spending. If approved by the voters, 
related  legislation  will  become  effective  that  could  limit  the  amount  of  reserves  that  may  be 
maintained  at  the  District  level.  The  District  cannot  predict  how  this  legislation  will  impact  is 
reserves and future spending.

Local  Control  Funding  Formula.    Legislation  adopted  in  connection  with  the  State’s 
2013-14  Budget  included  the  implementation  of  the  Local  Control  Funding  Formula  (the 
“LCFF”), which changed the formula by which school districts in California receive funding from 
the  State.  As  described  in  more  detail  herein  under  the  heading  “STATE  FUNDING  OF 
EDUCATION - Recent State Budgets- 2013-14 State Budget” the adoption of the 2013-14 State 
Budget and its related implementing legislation includes significant reforms to education finance 
in the State with the adoption of the LCFF.  Under the LCFF, the emphasis shifts from a State-
controlled  system  with  funding  based  largely  on  ADA  and  the  revenue  limit  with  numerous 
State-mandated  categorical  programs,  to  a  locally-controlled  system  with  a  funding  formula 
which  attempts  to  better  meet  the  needs  of  students,  particularly  those  students  which  come 
from low-income families or are English language learners which may require more support for 
success in school, and which provides local school officials with the ability to decide how best to 
meet the needs of their students. 

 
Funding under the LCFF consists of the following: 
 
1.  Base grant of $7,643 per ADA, plus  
 
2.  20% supplemental funding for English language learners, students from low-

income families and foster youth, plus  

 
3.  A concentration grant for districts with enrollment of more than 55 percent of 
English learners, students from low-income families and foster youth of up to 
22.5%  of  a  local  education  agency’s  base  grant,  based  on  the  number  of 
such students, plus 

 
4.    An  economic  recovery  target,  to  bring  local  agencies  back  to  pre-recession 

funding levels. 

 
The new legislation includes a “hold harmless” provision which provides that a district or 
charter  school  will  maintain  total  revenue  limit  and  categorical  funding  at  its  2012-13  level, 
unadjusted for changes in ADA, or cost of living adjustments. 

 
The District has benefited under the LCFF, with an unduplicated pupil count percentage 
of 80.39%. In addition to the base grant amount, LCFF funds the supplemental grants at 20% of 
the  base  grant  amount  and  the  concentration  grant  at  50%  of  the  base  grand  amount.  The 
District receives concentration grant money equal to 80.39% - 55% = 25.39% of the base grant 
amount.  
 

District Budget and Interim Financial Reporting 

 
Budgeting - Education Code Requirements.  The District is required by provisions of 
the  State  Education  Code  to  maintain  a  balanced  budget  each  year,  in  which  the  sum  of 
expenditures and the ending fund balance cannot exceed the sum of revenues and the carry-
over  fund  balance  from  the  previous  year.  The  State  Department  of  Education  imposes  a 
uniform  budgeting  and  accounting  format  for  school  districts.  The  budget  process  for  school 
districts  was  substantially  amended  by  Assembly  Bill  1200  (“AB  1200”),  which  became  State 
law on October 14, 1991. Portions of AB 1200 are summarized below. 

 
School districts must adopt a budget on or before July 1 of each year.  The budget must 
be submitted to the county superintendent within five days of adoption or by July 1, whichever 

A-8 

 

 

 

occurs first.  A district may be on either a dual or single budget cycle.  The dual budget option 
requires  a  revised  and  readopted  budget  by  September  1  that  is  subject  to  State-mandated 
standards  and  criteria.    The  revised  budget  must  reflect  changes  in  projected  income  and 
expenses subsequent to July 1.  The single budget is only readopted if it is disapproved by the 
county office of education, or as needed.  The District is on a single budget cycle and adopts its 
budget on or before July 1.  The District adopted its 2012-13 Budget on June 21, 2012. 

 
For  both  dual  and  single  budgets  submitted  on  July  1,  the  county  superintendent  will 
examine  the  adopted  budget  for  compliance  with  the  standards  and  criteria  adopted  by  the 
State Board of Education and identify technical corrections necessary to bring the budget into 
compliance, will determine if the budget allows the district to meet its current obligations and will 
determine if the budget is consistent with a financial plan that will enable the district to meet its 
multi-year  financial  commitments.    On  or  before  August  15,  the  county  superintendent  will 
approve or disapprove the adopted budget for each school district.  Budgets will be disapproved 
if they fail the above standards.  The district board must be notified by August 15 of the county 
superintendent's  recommendations  for  revision  and  reasons  for  the  recommendations.    The 
county  superintendent  may  assign  a  fiscal  advisor  or  appoint  a  committee  to  examine  and 
comment on the superintendent's recommendations.  The committee must report its findings no 
later than August 20.  Any recommendations made by the county superintendent must be made 
available  by  the  district  for  public  inspection.    The  law  does  not  provide  for  conditional 
approvals;  budgets  must  be  either  approved  or  disapproved.    No  later  than  August  20,  the 
county superintendent must notify the Superintendent of Public Instruction of all school districts 
whose budget has been disapproved. 

 
For all dual budget options and for single and dual budget option districts whose budgets 
have  been  disapproved,  the  district  must  revise  and  readopt  its  budget  by  September  8, 
reflecting changes in projected income and expense since July 1, including responding to the 
county  superintendent's  recommendations.    The  county  superintendent  must  determine  if  the 
budget conforms with the standards and criteria applicable to final district budgets and not later 
than October 8, will approve or disapprove the revised budgets.  If the budget is disapproved, 
the county superintendent will call for the formation of a budget review committee pursuant to 
Education Code Section 42127.1.  Until a district's budget is approved, the district will operate 
on the lesser of its proposed budget for the current fiscal year or the last budget adopted and 
reviewed for the prior fiscal year. 

 
Interim Certifications Regarding Ability to Meet Financial Obligations.  A State law 
adopted  in  1991  ("A.B.  1200")  imposed  additional  financial  reporting  requirements  on  school 
districts,  and  established  guidelines  for  emergency  State  aid  apportionments.  Under  the 
provisions  of  A.B.  1200,  each  school  district  is  required  to  file  interim  certifications  with  the 
County Superintendent (on December 15, for the period ended October 31, and by mid-March 
for  the  period  ended  January  31)  as  to  its  ability  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  for  the 
remainder  of  the  then-current  fiscal  year  and,  based  on  current  forecasts, for the subsequent 
two fiscal years. The county office of education reviews the certification and issues the following 
types of certifications: 

•   Positive certification - the school district will meet its financial obligations for 

the current fiscal year and subsequent two fiscal years.   

 
•    Negative certification - the school district will be unable to meet its financial 

obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year or subsequent fiscal year.  

A-9 

 

 

•    Qualified  certification  -  the  school  district  may  not  meet  its  financial 

obligations for the current fiscal year or subsequent two fiscal years. 

 
Under California law, any school district and office of education that has a qualified or 
negative  certification  in  any  fiscal  year  may  not  issue,  in  that  fiscal  year  or  in  the  next 
succeeding fiscal year, certificates of participation, tax anticipation notes, revenue bonds or any 
other debt instruments that do not require the approval of the voters of the district, unless the 
applicable  county  superintendent  of  schools  determines  that  the  district’s  repayment  of 
indebtedness  is  probable.    In  addition,  under  the  California  Education  Code,  a  school  district 
which has received a qualified or negative certification on its most recent interim report may not 
issue  and  sell  general  obligation  bonds  on  its  own  behalf  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the 
Education Code, notwithstanding that the Board of Supervisors of the County with jurisdiction 
over the school district has adopted a resolution allowing a school district to do so.  

District’s Budget Approval/Disapproval and Certification History.   The District has not 
received any qualified or negative certifications of its financial reports in the past five years, nor 
have any of its budgets been disapproved.  The District’s most recent interim report, the Second 
Interim for fiscal year 2013-14, received a positive certification. 

 
Copies of the District’s budget, interim reports and certifications may be obtained upon 
request  from  the  District  Office  at  4385  Price  Avenue,  Santa  Rosa,  California  95407.    The 
District may impose charges for copying, mailing and handling. 
 
Long-Term Borrowing 

 
General  Obligation  Bonds.    The  District  issued  its  General  Obligation  Bonds,  Series 
1993 (the “1993 Bonds”) as capital appreciation bonds in the original denominational amount of 
$1,099,928 and its General Obligation Bonds, Series 2003 (the “2003 Bonds”) issued as current 
interest bonds in the original principal amount of $765,000 and capital appreciation bonds, in the 
original denominational amount of $2,335,043.  

 
The debt service on the District’s general obligation bonds is payable from ad valorem 
taxes  levied  by  the  County.  See  “DEBT  SERVICE  SCHEDULES  –  Combined  Debt  Service 
Schedule”  in  the  front  part  of  the  Official  Statement  for  the  debt  service  requirements  for  the 
1993 Bonds and the 2003 Bonds. 

 
The  District  has  never  defaulted  on  the  payment  of  principal  or  interest  on  any  of  its 

indebtedness. 

 

Early Retirement Incentives 

 
The District adopted an early retirement incentive program where by the service credit to 
eligible  certificated  employees  was  increased  by  two  years.  The  future  liability  of  these  early 
retirement incentive benefits at June 30, 2013 was $30,274. 
 
Termination Benefits 

 
The  District  periodically  offers  an  early  retirement  incentive  to  certificated  employees 
who  have  reached  the  age  of  55  in  the  retirement  year  and  have  taught  in  the  District  for  a 
minimum of 10 years. Termination benefits consist of a yearly stipend that can be received as a 
monthly check, a single lump sum payment or applied to health and welfare benefits. For the 

A-10 

 

  

 

fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2013,  the  cost  of  providing  these  benefits  for  14  retirees  totaled 
$66,229. The liability for the accrued termination benefits payable at June 30, 2013 is $182,230, 
which  consists  entirely  of  voluntary  termination  benefits  to  be  paid  between  July  1,  2013  and 
June 30, 2018 for 17 ongoing retirees. For a description of the actuarial valuation and methods 
and assumptions used to determine liabilities for the termination benefits, see “APPENDIX B - 
AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE DISTRICT FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 
30, 2013 – Note 9.” 

State Funding of Education and Revenue Limitations 

 
Annual State apportionments of basic and equalization aid to school districts for general 
purposes are computed up to a revenue limit per unit of average daily attendance (“A.D.A.”).  
Such  apportionments  will,  generally  speaking,  amount  to  the  difference  between  the  District’s 
revenue  limit  and  the  District’s  local  property  tax  allocation.    Revenue  limit  calculations  are 
adjusted annually in accordance with a number of factors designed primarily to provide cost of 
living increases and to equalize revenues among California school districts.  

 
California  school  districts  receive  a  significant  portion  of  their  funding  from  State 
appropriations.  As a result, decreases in State revenues may affect appropriations made by the 
Legislature to school districts. 

Revenue Sources 

 
The District categorizes its general fund revenues into four sources:

(1)  Consists of a mix of State apportionments of basic and equalization aid and local property tax revenues. 
Source: Wright Elementary School District. 

 
Each of these revenue sources is described below. 
 
Revenue  Limit  Sources.    Beginning  in  fiscal  year  1973-74,  California  school  districts 
operated under general purpose revenue limits established by the State Legislature.  In general, 
revenue  limits  were  calculated  for  each  school  district  by  multiplying  (1)  the  average  daily 
attendance  for  such  district  by  (2)  a  base  revenue  limit  per  unit  of  A.D.A.    The  revenue  limit 
calculations were adjusted annually in accordance with a number of factors designated primarily 
to provide cost of living increases and to equalize revenues among all California school districts 
of the same type. 

 
Funding of the District's revenue limit was provided by a mix of (1) local property taxes 
the  State 

and  (2)  State  apportionments  of  basic  and  equalization  aid. 

  Generally, 

A-11 

 

 

apportionments  amounted  to  the  difference  between  the  District's  revenue  limit  and  its  local 
property tax revenues. 

 
Beginning in 1978-79, Proposition 13 and its implementing legislation provided for each 
county  to  levy  (except  for  levies  to  support  prior  voter-approved  indebtedness)  and  collect  all 
property taxes, and prescribed how levies on county-wide property values are to be shared with 
local  taxing  entities  within  each  county.  As  described  in  this  Official  Statement,  with  the 
implementation  of  the  LCFF  in  fiscal  year  2013-14,  the  amount  of  State  funding  provided  to 
school districts is now determined with a funding model that attempts to better meet the needs 
of  students,  particularly  those  students  which  come  from  low-income  families  or  are  English 
language  learners  requiring  more  support  for  success  in  school.  The  LCFF  is  meant  to  give 
local school officials more control in order to better meet the needs of their students. The LCFF 
affects how much funding a district will receive, but generally not the source of such funding, 
being its share of local property taxes together with the State funding provided in the LCFF. 

 
Federal Revenues. The federal government provides funding for some District programs, 

including special education programs and No Child Left Behind. 

 
Other State Revenues.  As discussed above, the District receives State apportionment 
of basic and equalization aid in an amount equal to the difference between the District's revenue 
limit  and  its  property  tax  revenues.    In  addition  to  such  apportionment  revenue,  the  District 
receives substantial other State revenues. 

 
These  other  State  revenues  are  primarily  unrestricted  as  a  result  of  the  State  Budget 
Flexibility  for  2008-2009  through  2014-15.    Unrestricted  State  revenues  include  categorical 
revenues  for  hourly  programs,  instructional  materials,  deferred  maintenance,  adult  education, 
school safety, school and library block grant, professional development block grant, GATE, adult 
education, pupil retention block grant, supplemental high school counseling, and other formerly 
restricted  revenue.    Restricted  State  revenues  include  Economic  Impact  Aid  and  specialized 
grant programs.  

 
The District receives State aid from the California State Lottery (the “Lottery”), which 
was  established  by  a  constitutional  amendment  approved  in  the  November  1984  general 
election. Lottery revenues must be used for the education of students and cannot be used for 
non-instructional  purposes  such  as  real  property  acquisition,  facility  construction,  or  the 
financing  of  research.    Moreover,  State  Proposition  20  approved  in  March  2000  requires  that 
50%  of  the  increase  in  Lottery  revenues  over  1997-98  levels  must  be  restricted  to  use  on 
instructional materials. 

 
Other  Local  Revenues.    In  addition  to  property  taxes,  the  District  receives  additional 

local revenues from items such as rental income, interest earnings and other local sources.   

Effect of State Budget on Revenues  
 

Public school districts in California are dependent on revenues from the State for a large 
portion  of  their  operating  budgets.    California  school  districts  receive  an  average  of  about  55 
percent of their operating revenues from various State sources.  The primary source of funding 
for school districts is the revenue limit, which is a combination of State funds and local property 
taxes  (see  “-  State  Funding  of  Education  and  Revenue  Limitations”  above).    State  funds 
typically  make  up  the  majority  of  a  district’s  revenue  limit.    School  districts  also  receive 
substantial funding from the State for various categorical programs.  

A-12 

 

 

 
The  availability  of  State  funds  for  public  education  is  a  function  of  constitutional 
provisions  affecting  school  district  revenues  and  expenditures  (see  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND 
STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT  REVENUES  AND  APPROPRIATIONS”), 
the condition of the State economy (which affects total revenue available to the State general 
fund), and the annual State budget process. 

State Funding of Education and Recent State Budgets  
 

General.  The State requires that from all State revenues there first shall be set apart 
the moneys to be applied for support of the public school system and public institutions of higher 
education.  Public school districts in California are dependent on revenues from the State for a 
large portion of their operating budgets.  California school districts receive an average of about 
55  percent  of  their  operating  revenues  from  various  State  sources.    The  primary  source  of 
funding for school districts is the revenue limit, which is a combination of State funds and local 
property  taxes  (see  “–  State  Funding  of  Education  and  Revenue  Limitations”  above).    State 
funds typically make up the majority of a district’s revenue limit.  School districts also receive 
substantial funding from the State for various categorical programs.   

 
The  availability  of  State  funds  for  public  education  is  a  function  of  constitutional 
provisions  affecting  school  district  revenues  and  expenditures  (see  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND 
STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT  REVENUES  AND  APPROPRIATIONS”), 
the condition of the State economy (which affects total revenue available to the State general 
fund),  and  the  annual  State  budget  process.    Decreases  in  State  revenues  may  significantly 
affect appropriations made by the legislature to school districts. 

 
The following information concerning the State’s budgets for the current and most recent 
preceding years has been compiled from publicly-available information provided by the State.  
Neither the District, the County, nor the Underwriter is responsible for the information relating to 
the  State’s  budgets  provided  in  this  section.    Further  information  is  available  from  the  Public 
Finance Division of the State Treasurer’s Office. 

 
The Budget Process. The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30.  
The annual budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal 
year  (the  “Governor’s  Budget”).    Under  State  law,  the  annual  proposed  Governor’s  Budget 
cannot  provide  for  projected  expenditures  in  excess  of  projected  revenues  and  balances 
available  from  prior  fiscal  years.    Following  the  submission  of  the  Governor’s  Budget,  the 
Legislature takes up the proposal. 

 
Under the State Constitution, money may be drawn from the State Treasury only through 
an appropriation made by law.  The primary source of the annual expenditure authorizations is 
the Budget Act as approved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor.  The Budget Act 
must  be  approved  by  a  majority  vote  of  each  House  of  the  Legislature.    The  Governor  may 
reduce or eliminate specific line items in the Budget Act or any other appropriations bill without 
vetoing the entire bill.  Such individual line-item vetoes are subject to override by a two-thirds 
majority vote of each House of the Legislature. 

 
Appropriations  also  may  be  included  in  legislation  other  than  the  Budget  Act.    Bills 
containing appropriations (except for K-14 education) must be approved by a two-thirds majority 
vote  in  each  House  of  the  Legislature  and  be  signed  by  the  Governor.    Bills  containing  K-14 

A-13 

 

 

education  appropriations  only  require  a  simple  majority  vote.    Continuing  appropriations, 
available without regard to fiscal year, may also be provided by statute or the State Constitution. 

 
Funds necessary to meet an appropriation need not be in the State Treasury at the time 

such appropriation is enacted; revenues may be appropriated in anticipation of their receipt. 

 
Recent State Budgets. Certain information about the State budgeting process and the 
State Budget is available through several State of California sources.  A convenient source of 
information is the State’s website, where recent official statements for State bonds are posted.

2013-14 State Budget 

 
On June 27, 2013, Governor Brown approved the 2013-14 Budget Act, projecting $97.1 
billion in general fund revenues and adopting a $96.3 billion spending plan, the first balanced 
budget in many years. Temporary revenues provided by the passage of Proposition 30 (Sales 
and Income Tax Revenue Increase approved by State voters at an election held on November 
6,  2012)  and  spending  cuts  made  in  the  past  two  years  mean  that  the  State’s  budget  is 
projected to remain balanced for the foreseeable future.  The 2013-14 State Budget maintains a 
$1.1 billion reserve and pays down a budgetary deficit, projected to be reduced from $35 billion 
to $27 billion in 2013-14 and to below $5 billion by the end of 2016-17.  

 
The Budget includes total funding of $70 billion ($39.6 billion General Fund and $30.4 
billion other funds) for all K-12 education programs.  The 2013-14 State Budget and its related 

A-14 

implementing  legislation  enacts  significant  reforms  to  the  State’s  system  of  K-12  education 
finance  with  the  enactment  of  a  new  funding  formula  known  as  the  “Local  Control  Funding 
Formula,”  described  in  greater  detail  below  (the  “LCFF”).    Under  the  LCFF,  Proposition  98 
funding, the State’s minimum funding guarantee for K-12 schools and community colleges that 
went into effect in fiscal year 1988-89, is $55.3 billion in the 2013-14 fiscal year, an increase of 
more than $8 billion over the 2011-12 fiscal year funding level.  The 2013-14 Budget projects 
Proposition 98 funding for K-12 education to grow by almost $20 billion from the 2011-12 fiscal 
year  to  the  2016-17  fiscal  year,  representing  an  increase  of  more  than  $2,800  per  student 
during such period.    

 
Local Control Funding Formula. The LCFF attempts to move from an existing school 
funding system characterized as overly complex and inequitable to a locally-controlled system, 
which responds to research and practical experience indicating that students from low income 
families and English language learners often require supplemental services and support to be 
successful in school.  

 
State Funding under the LCFF.  The LCFF changes the State funding system for school 
districts,  charter  schools  and  county  offices  of  education  by,  among  other  changes, 
consolidating  most  categorical  programs  with  the  existing  revenue  limit  structure  to  provide  a 
new student formula which will be phased in over seven years, and implementing supplemental 
and  concentration  grants  to  English  language  learners  and  economically  disadvantaged 
students. The LCFF includes the following components: 

 
•  A  base  grant  for  each  local  education  agency  equivalent  to  $7,643  per  unit  of 
A.D.A.  This base grant is $2,375 more than the average revenue limit provided 
prior to LCFF implementation. 

 
•  A  20%  supplemental  grant  for  English  learners,  students  from  low-income 
families  and  foster  youth  to  reflect  increased  costs  associated  with  educating 
those students. 

 
•  An  additional  concentration  grant  of  up  to  22.5%  of  a  local  education  agency’s 
base grant, based on the number of English learners, students from low-income 
families  and  foster  youth  served  by  the  local  agency  that  comprise  more  than 
55% of enrollment. 

 
•  An economic recovery target to ensure that almost every local education agency 
receives  at  least  their  pre-recession  funding  level,  adjusted  for  inflation,  at  full 
implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula. 

 

 

 
Accountability  under  the  LCFF.    The  LCFF  moves  from  a  state-controlled  system  that 
emphasized inputs (largely in the form of categorical funding which required funds to be spent 
on specific projects and programs) to a locally-controlled system in which local agencies decide 
the best way to spend funds, focused instead on improved outcomes.  However, districts will be 
required to increase or improve services for English language learners, low income, and foster 
youth  students  in  proportion  to  supplemental  and  concentration  grant  funding  received.    All 
school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools will be required to develop and 
adopt  local  control  and  accountability  plans,  which  will  identify  local  goals  in  areas  that  are 
priorities for the State, including pupil achievement, parent engagement, and school climate. 

A-15 

 

County  superintendents  will  review  and  provide  support  to  the  districts  under  their 
jurisdiction,  and  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  will  perform  a  corresponding  role  for 
county offices of education. In addition, the 2013-14 Budget creates the California Collaborative 
for Education Excellence to advise and assist school districts, county offices of education, and 
charter schools in achieving the goals identified in their plans.  

 
The  State  will  continue 

through  statewide 
assessments, produce an Academic Performance Index for schools and subgroups of students, 
determine  the  contents  of  the  school  accountability  report  card,  and  establish  policies  to 
implement the federal accountability system. 

to  measure  student  achievement 

 
Other K-12 Budget Adjustments.  In  addition  to  the first  year  funding provided  under 

the LCFF, the 2013-14 State Budget includes: 

 
•  Common Core Implementation Funding.  An increase of $1.25 billion in one-time 
Proposition 98 funding to support the implementation of the Common Core – new 
standards for evaluating student achievement in English-language arts and math.   
Funding  will  be  distributed  on 
for  professional 
development,  instructional  materials  and  technology.    Local  agencies  must 
develop a plan on how to spend these funds over the next two years, and hold a 
public hearing on such plan. 

the  basis  of  enrollment 

 
•  Career Technical Education Pathways Grant Program.  $250 million for one-time 
competitive capacity building grants for K-12 and community colleges to support 
programs based on work-based learning. 

 
•  K-12  Mandates  Block  Grant.    $50  million  to  reflect  the  inclusion  of  graduation 
requirements mandate within the block grant program, which will be distributed to 
school districts, county offices of education and charter schools with enrollment 
in grades 9-12. 

 
•  K-12 Budget Deferral Repayment.  An increase of $1.6 billion in 2012-13 and an 
increase of $242.3 million in 2013-14 for the repayment of inter-year budgetary 
deferrals. 

 
•  Proposition  39  (Energy  Efficiency  Projects)  Implementation.    $381  million  in 
Proposition 98 funding is allocated to support energy efficiency projects approved 
by  the  California  Energy  Commission.    Of  this  amount,  85  percent  will  be 
allocated  based  on  A.D.A  and  15  percent  will  be  allocated  based  on  free  and 
reduced price meal eligibility. 

 
•  Special Education Funding Reform.  Consolidations for various special education 
programs  to  simplify  special  education  finance  and  provide  additional  funding 
flexibility. 

 
Higher Education and Health Care. The 2013-14 State Budget increases funding for 
higher  education  by  between  $1,649  and  $2,491  per  student  through  2016-17.  The  2013-14 
State  Budget  provides  funding  to  expand  Medi-Cal  to  approximately  1.4  million  Californians 
pursuant to the federal law known as the Affordable Care Act. The State anticipates that this will 
significantly increase health care coverage, improve access to mental health services, expand 
substance use disorder treatment and take advantage of new federal dollars.

Numerous Factors Affecting Budget and Projections.  The execution of the 2013-14 
State Budget, when adopted, may be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to: 
(i) shifts of costs from the federal government to the State, (ii) national, State and international 
economic  conditions,  (iii)  litigation  risk  associated  with  spending  reductions,  including  the 
elimination of redevelopment agencies, (iv) rising health care costs (v) large unfunded liabilities 
for  retired  State  employee’s  pensions  and  healthcare,  (vi)  deferred  maintenance  of  State’s 
critical  infrastructure  and  (vii)  other  factors,  all  or  any  of  which  could  cause  the  revenue  and 
spending  projections  made  in  2013-14  State  Budget    to  be  unattainable.  The  District  cannot 
predict the impact that the 2013-14 State Budget, or subsequent budgets, will have on its own 
finances and operations.  Additionally, the District cannot predict the accuracy of any projections 
made in the State’s 2013-14 State Budget.  

 
The  complete  2013-14  State  Budget  is  available  from  the  California  Department  of 
Finance  website  at  www.dof.ca.gov.    The  District  can  take  no  responsibility  for  the  continued 
accuracy of this internet address or for the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of information 
posted  there,  and  such  information  is  not  incorporated  in  this  Official  Statement  by  such

decision with respect to the Bonds. 

2014-15 Adopted State Budget 

 
On  June  20,  2014,  Governor  Brown  approved  the  2014-15  Budget  Act  (the  “2014-15 
Budget”), projecting $108 billion in general fund revenues, which is $7.3 million more in general 
fund  revenues  than  in  fiscal  year  2013-14.    The  2014-15  Budget  is  balanced  and  projects 
paying  down  more  than  $10  billion  in  unprecedented  amounts  of  budgetary  debt  from  past 
years, including paying down deferral of payments to schools by $5 billion, paying off Economic 
Recovery  Bonds,  repaying  various  special  fund  loans,  and  funding  $100  million  in  mandate 
claims that have been owed to local governments since 2004. The budgetary deficit is projected 
to be reduced to below $5 billion by the end of 2016-17.  The fiscal year begins with a 2014-15 
State  Budget  reserve  of  $2  billion  dollars,  including  $1.6  billion  in  the  State’s  Budget 
Stabilization Account, also known as the State’s rainy day fund.  Temporary revenues provided 
by the passage of Proposition 30 (Sales and Income Tax Revenue Increase approved by State 
voters at an election held on November 8, 2011) and spending cuts have allowed for continued 
economic  growth  in  the  State.    The  2014-15  State  Budget  also  contains  triggers  allowing  for 
additional spending, if various revenue benchmarks are exceeded.  If revenues surpass certain 
estimates, then the Budget calls for more funds to be applied to higher education and to pay 
down debt. Certain highlights of the 2014-15 Budget are described below. 

 
Plan  for  Reducing  STRS  Unfunded  Liability.    The  California  State  Teachers’ 
Retirement System (“STRS”) has funded significant unfunded liability. Without changes to how 
the system is funded, STRS is expected to run out of money in about 33 years. To prevent this, 
the 2014-15 Budget sets forth a plan that shares responsibility among the school districts, the 
state, and teachers to better fund STRS. Contributions for the first year from all three of these 
sources will total $275 million. Contributions will increase in subsequent years, reaching more 
than $5 billion annually.  This plan is projected to eliminate unfunded liability by 2046.  

 
Constitutional Amendment on November, 2014 Ballot:  Rainy Day Fund.  The 2014-
15  State  Budget  includes  a  proposed  constitutional  amendment  which  will  be  placed  before 
State voters in November, 2014.  The measure, upon approval, would alter the State’s existing 

A-17 

requirements  for  the  Budget  Stabilization  Account,  the  State’s  existing  rainy  day  account.    If 
approved, this amendment would:  

•  Require  deposits  into  the  Rainy  Day  Fund  whenever  capital  gains 
revenues rise to more than 8 percent of General Fund tax revenues, and 
would set the maximum size of the Rainy Day Fund at 10 percent of the 
General Fund revenues.  
 

•  Require  half  of  each  year’s  deposit  for  the  next  15  years  be  used  for 

supplemental payments of debt or other long-term liabilities. 
 

•  Allow for withdrawal of funds only for a disaster or if spending remains at 
or  below  the  highest  level  of  spending  from  the  past  three  years.  The 
maximum amount that could be withdrawn in the first year of a recession 
would be limited to half of the Rainy Day Fund’s balance. 
 

•  Require  that  the  state  provide  a  multiyear  budget  forecast  to  better 

manage the state’s long-term finances. 
 

 

 

 

•  Create  a  Proposition  98  reserve,  known  as  the  Public  School  System 
Stabilization Account, where spikes in funding would be saved for future 
years. This is intended to smooth school spending and minimize future 
cuts to education funding.  

 
In addition, if approved in November, additional legislation will become effective which 
could  limit  the  amount  school  districts  may  maintain  in  reserves.    Specifically,  the  legislation 
provides that in any fiscal year immediately after a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the 
Public  School  System  Stabilization  Account,  a  school  district  may  not  adopt  a  budget  that 
contains a reserve in excess of twice the applicable minimum reserve amount.  

 
K - 12 Budget Adjustments. The 2014-15 State Budget includes total funding of $76.6 
billion  ($45.3  billion  General  Fund  and  $31.3  billion  other  funds)  for  all  K-12  education 
programs.  Prop.  98  funding  has  contributed  $10  billion  to  the  total  funding  amount  and  the 
2014-15 State Budget provides $1,954 more per K-12 student in 2014-15 than was provided in 
2011-12.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  also  provides  $4.7  billion  for  the  second  year  of 
implementing the LCFF and continues to commit most new funding to districts serving English 
language learners, students from low-income families, and youth in foster care. The Education 
Budget Trailer Bill (“SB 858”) is included in the 2014-15 State Budget and contains two separate 
provisions that have the potential to affect district reserve funds.  In addition, the 2014-15 State 
Budget includes the following:

the  LCFF.  This 

•  Local Control Funding Formula. The 2014-15 State Budget contains an increase 
of  $4.75  billion  in  the  Proposition  98  General  Fund  to  continue  the  State’s 
transition 
funding 
implementation  gap  by  more  than  29  percent.  Additionally,  the  2014-15  State 
Budget addresses an administrative problem related to the collection of income 
eligibility forms that are used to determine student eligibility for free or reduced-
price meals.

the  remaining

• 

•  K-12 Deferrals. The 2014-15 State Budget repays nearly $4.7 billion Proposition 
98 General Fund for K-12 expenses that had been deferred from one year to the 
next during the past few years. This repayment will leave an outstanding balance 
of  less  than  $900  million  in  K-12  deferrals.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  also 
contains  a  trigger  mechanism  that  will  appropriate  any  additional  funding 
resources attributable to the 2013-14 and 2014-15 fiscal years subsequent to the 
enactment of the 2014-15 State Budget for the purpose of retiring the remaining 
$900 million in K-12 deferrals.  
 
Independent  Study.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  reduces  administrative  burdens 
and  frees  up  time  for  teachers  to  spend  on  student  instruction  and  support, 
making  it  easier  for  schools  to  offer  and  expand  instructional  opportunities 
available to students through non-classroom based instruction.  
 

•  K-12 Mandates. The 2014-15 State Budget provides $400.5 million in one-time 
Proposition  98  General  Fund  to  reimburse  K-12  local  educational  agencies  for 
the costs of state-mandated programs. These funds will make a significant down 
payment  on  outstanding  mandate  debt,  while  providing  school  districts,  county 
offices of education, and charter schools with discretionary resources to support 
critical investments such as Common Core implementation.  
 

•  K-12 High-Speed Internet Access. The 2014-15 State Budget increases the one-
time  Proposition  98  General  Fund  for  the  K-12  High  Speed  Network  by  $26.7 
million. This Fund provides technical assistance and grants to local educational 
agencies to address the technology requirements necessary for Common Core 
implementation.  
 

•  Career  Technical  Education  Pathways  Program.  The  2014-15  State  Budget 
increases by $250 million the one-time Proposition 98 General Fund to support a 
second  cohort  of  competitive  grants  for  participating  K-12  local  educational 
agencies.  Established  in  the  2013  Budget  Act,  the  Career  Pathways  Trust 
Program  provides  grant  awards  to  improve  career  technical  programs  and 
linkages between employers, schools and community colleges.  

 
Higher Education and Healthcare. The 2014-15 State Budget includes total funding of 
$26.2 billion ($14.7 billion General Fund and local property tax and $11.5 billion other funds). It 
also provides for up to a 20 percent increase in General Fund appropriations over a four-year 
period.  The  2014-15  Budget  includes  a  5  percent  increase  in  2014-15  for  each  university 
system,  which  equals  $284  million  total.  Regarding  healthcare,  the  state’s  adoption  of  the 
optional  expansion  of  Medi-Cal  under  federal  law  known  as  the  Affordable  Care  Act  created 
major  new  spending  commitments.  The  2014-15  Budget  assumes  an  additional  Medi-Cal 
caseload of 2.5 million individuals and a rise in costs of $2.4 billion over fiscal year 2012-13.   

 
Emergency Drought Response. On January 17, 2014, Governor Brown proclaimed a 
state  of  emergency  due  to  the  severe  drought  conditions  faced  by  the  state.  Legislation  was 
enacted  in  February  which  provided  $687.4  million  to  support  drought  relief.  The  2014-15 
Budget  includes  additional  one-time  resources  to  continue  immediate  drought-related  efforts 
started  in  2014,  such  as  an  increase  of  $53.8  million  General  Fund  and  $12.2  million  other 
funds for firefighting efforts, and an increase of $18.1 million General Fund to aid in assessing 
water conditions and provide public outreach regarding water conservation.

Numerous Factors Affecting Budget and Projections. The execution of the 2014-15 
State Budget may be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to: (i) shifts of costs 
from  the  federal  government  to  the  State,  (ii)  national,  State  and  international  economic 
conditions,  (iii)  litigation  risk  associated  with  spending  reductions,  including  the  elimination  of 
redevelopment  agencies,  (iv)  rising  health  care  costs  (v)  large  unfunded  liabilities  for  retired 
State  employee’s  pensions  and  healthcare,  (vi)  deferred  maintenance  of  State’s  critical 
infrastructure and (vii) other factors, all or any of which could cause the revenue and spending 
projections made in 2014-15 State Budget  to be unattainable. The District cannot predict the 
impact that the 2014-15 State Budget, or subsequent budgets, will have on its own finances and 
operations.  Additionally, the District cannot predict the accuracy of any projections made in the 
State’s 2014-15 State Budget.  

 
The  complete  2014-15  State  Budget  is  available  from  the  California  Department  of 
Finance  website  at  www.dof.ca.gov.    The  District  can  take  no  responsibility  for  the  continued 
accuracy of this internet address or for the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of information 
posted  there,  and  such  information  is  not  incorporated  in  this  Official  Statement  by  such 
reference. The information referred to above should not be relied upon in making an investment 
decision with respect to the Bonds. 

 
The State has not entered into any contractual commitment with the District, the County, 
or the Owners of the Bonds to provide State budget information to the District or the owners of 
the  Bonds.    Although  they  believe  the  State  sources  of  information  listed  above  are  reliable, 
neither the District nor the Underwriter assumes any responsibility for the accuracy of the State 
Budget  information  set  forth  or  referred  to  in  this  Official  Statement  or  incorporated  herein. 
However, the Bonds are secured by ad valorem taxes levied and collected on taxable property 
in  the  District,  without  limit  as  to  rate  or  amount  (except  certain  personal  property  which  is 
taxable  at  limited  rates),  and  are  not  secured  by  a  pledge  of  revenues  of  the  District  or  its 
general fund. 

Legal Challenges to State Funding of Education 

 
The  application  of  Proposition  98  and  other  statutory  regulations  has  become 
increasingly difficult to predict accurately in recent years.  For a discussion of how the provisions 
of Proposition 98 have been applied to school funding see “STATE FUNDING OF EDUCATION 
AND RECENT STATE BUDGETS” above. 

 
2010  Robles-Wong  Litigation.  On  May  20,  2010,  a  plaintiff  class  of  numerous  current 
California  public  school  students  and  several  school  districts,  together  with  the  California 
Congress of Parents, Teachers & Students, the Association of California School Administrators 
and  the  California  School  Boards  Association  filed  suit  in  Alameda  County  Superior  Court 
challenging the system of financing for public schools in California as unconstitutional. In Maya 
Robles-Wong,  et  al.  v.  State  of  California,  plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief, 
including a permanent injunction compelling the State to abandon the existing system of public 
school  finance.  On  July  16,  2010,  the  California  Teachers’  Association  filed  a  Complaint  in 
Intervention,  making  the  same  allegations  and  seeking  the  same  declaratory  and  injunctive 
relief.  On  January  14,  2011,  the  court  dismissed  certain  of  the  causes  of  action,  including 
causes of action that alleged a constitutional right to a particular level of education funding and 
violations  of  equal  protection  of  the  law,  based  on  certain  State  constitutional  provisions.  On 
July 26, 2011, the Superior Court rejected the plaintiff’s amended complaint as not stating an 
equal protection claim. On January 25, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an appeal in the 1st Appellate 

A-20 

District. In January 2013, various amicus curiae briefs were filed in support of the plaintiffs. On 
August  7,  2013,  a  letter  was  filed  by  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  regarding  the 
restructuring  of  the  K-12  financing  system  and  the  implementation  of  the  LCFF.  The  District 
cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the Robles-Wong litigation.  

 

CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS 

AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS 

 

The  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  is  payable  from  the  proceeds  of  an  ad 
valorem  tax  levied  by  the  County  for  the  payment  thereof.    The  provisions  of  law  discussed 
below are included in this section to describe the potential effect of Constitutional and statutory 
measures on the ability of the District to levy taxes and spend tax proceeds for operating and 
other  purposes.  It  should  not  be  inferred  from  the  inclusion  of  such  materials  that  these  laws 
impose any limitation on the ability of the District to levy taxes for payment of the Bonds.  The 
tax  levied  by  the  County  for  payment  of  the  Bonds  was  approved  by  the  District's  voters  in 
compliance with all applicable laws. 

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution 
 

Basic Property Tax Levy.  On June 6, 1978, California voters approved Proposition 13 
(“Proposition 13”), which added Article XIIIA to the State Constitution (“Article XIIIA”).  Article 
XIIIA  limits  the  amount  of  any  ad  valorem  tax  on  real  property  to  1%  of  the  full  cash  value 
thereof,  except  that  additional  ad  valorem  taxes  may  be  levied  to  pay  debt  service  on  (i) 
indebtedness approved by the voters prior to July 1, 1978, (ii) (as a result of an amendment to 
Article  XIIIA  approved  by  State  voters  on  June  3,  1986)  on  bonded  indebtedness  for  the 
acquisition or improvement of real property which has been approved on or after July 1, 1978 by 
two-thirds  of  the  voters  on  such  indebtedness,  and  (iii)  bonded  indebtedness  incurred  by  a 
school district or community college district for the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or 
replacement of school facilities or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities, 
approved  by  55%  of  the  voters  of  the  district,  but  only  if  certain  accountability  measures  are 
included  in  the  proposition.    As  described  under  “THE  BONDS  –  Authority  for  Issuance”,  the 
District received authorization by a requisite 55% of voters to issue the Bonds and has stated 
that  it  will  comply  with  all  applicable  accountability  measures  required  by  law.    Article  XIIIA 
defines full cash value to mean “the county assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on 
the  1975-76  tax  bill  under  full  cash  value,  or  thereafter,  the  appraised  value  of  real  property 
when  purchased,  newly  constructed,  or  a  change  in  ownership  have  occurred  after  the  1975 
assessment”.    This  full  cash  value  may  be  increased  at  a  rate  not  to  exceed  2%  per  year  to 
account for inflation. 

 
Article XIIIA has subsequently been amended to permit reduction of the “full cash value” 
base in the event of declining property values caused by damage, destruction or other factors, 
to  provide  that  there  would  be  no  increase  in  the  “full  cash  value”  base  in  the  event  of 
reconstruction of property damaged or destroyed in a disaster and in other minor or technical 
ways. 

 
Both  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  and  the  California  State  Supreme  Court  have 

upheld the general validity of Article XIIIA. 

 

 

 

 

A-21 

Legislation Implementing Article XIIIA. Legislation has been enacted and amended a 
number of times since 1978 to implement Article XIIIA.  Under current law, local agencies are no 
longer permitted to levy directly any property tax (except to pay voter-approved indebtedness).  
The 1% property tax is automatically levied by the county and distributed according to a formula 
among  taxing  agencies.    The  formula  apportions  the  tax  roughly  in  proportion  to  the  relative 
shares of taxes levied prior to 1979. 

 
Increases  of  assessed  valuation  resulting  from  reappraisals  of  property  due  to  new 
construction,  change  in  ownership  or  from  the  annual  adjustment  not  to  exceed  2%  are 
allocated among the various jurisdictions in the “taxing area” based upon their respective “situs.”  
Any such allocation made to a local agency continues as part of its allocation in future years. 

 
Inflationary Adjustment of Assessed Valuation.  As described above, the assessed 
value  of  a  property  may  be  increased  at  a  rate  not  to  exceed  2%  per  year  to  account  for 
inflation.  On December 27, 2001, the Orange County Superior Court, in County of Orange v. 
Orange County Assessment Appeals Board No. 3, held that where a home’s taxable value did 
not increase for two years, due to a flat real estate market, the Orange County assessor violated 
the 2% inflation adjustment provision of Article XIIIA, when the assessor tried to “recapture” the 
tax  value  of  the  property  by  increasing  its  assessed  value  by  4%  in  a  single  year.    The 
assessors  in  most  California  counties,  including  the  County,  use  a  similar  methodology  in 
raising  the  taxable  values  of  property  beyond  2%  in  a  single  year.    The  State  Board  of 
Equalization  has  approved  this  methodology  for  increasing  assessed  values.    On  appeal,  the 
Appellate Court held that the trial court erred in ruling that assessments are always limited to no 
more than 2% of the previous year’s assessment.  On May 10, 2004 a petition for review was 
filed  with  the  California  Supreme  Court.    The  petition  has  been  denied  by  the  California 
Supreme  Court.    As  a  result  of  this  litigation,  the  “recapture”  provision  described  above  may 
continue to be employed in determining the full cash value of property for property tax purposes. 

Unitary Property 

 

 

 

 

 
Some amount of property tax revenue of the District is derived from utility property which 
is  considered  part  of  a  utility  system  with  components  located  in  many  taxing  jurisdictions 
(“unitary  property”).    Under  the  State  Constitution,  such  property  is  assessed  by  the  State 
Board of Equalization (“SBE”) as part of a “going concern” rather than as individual pieces of 
real or personal property.  State-assessed unitary and certain other property is allocated to the 
counties by SBE, taxed at special county-wide rates, and the tax revenues distributed to taxing 
jurisdictions  (including  the  District)  according  to  statutory  formulae  generally  based  on  the 
distribution of taxes in the prior year. 

Constitutional Appropriations Limitation 

 
Article XIIIB  (“Article XIIIB”)  of  the  State  Constitution,  as  subsequently  amended  by 
Propositions 98 and 111, respectively, limits the annual appropriations of the State and of any 
city,  county,  school  district,  authority  or  other  political  subdivision  of  the  State  to  the  level  of 
appropriations  of  the  particular  governmental  entity  for  the  prior  fiscal  year,  as  adjusted  for 
changes in the cost of living and in population and for transfers in the financial responsibility for 
providing services and for certain declared emergencies.  For fiscal years beginning on or after 
July 1, 1990, the appropriations limit of each entity of government shall be the appropriations 
limit for the 1986-87 fiscal year adjusted for the changes made from that fiscal year under the 
provisions of Article XIIIB, as amended. 

A-22 

 

 

The  appropriations  of  an  entity  of  local  government  subject  to  Article XIIIB  limitations 
include  the  proceeds  of  taxes  levied  by  or  for  that  entity  and  the  proceeds  of  certain  state 
subventions to that entity.  “Proceeds of taxes” include, but are not limited to, all tax revenues 
and the proceeds to the entity from (a) regulatory licenses, user charges and user fees (but only 
to  the  extent  that  these  proceeds  exceed  the  reasonable  costs  in  providing  the  regulation, 
product or service), and (b) the investment of tax revenues. 

 
Appropriations subject to limitation do not include (a) refunds of taxes, (b) appropriations 
for debt service, (c) appropriations required to comply with certain mandates of the courts or the 
federal  government,  (d) appropriations  of  certain  special  districts,  (e) appropriations  for  all 
qualified  capital  outlay  projects  as  defined  by  the  legislature,  (f) appropriations  derived  from 
certain  fuel  and  vehicle  taxes  and  (g) appropriations  derived  from  certain  taxes  on  tobacco 
products. 

 
Article XIIIB  includes  a  requirement  that  all  revenues  received  by  an  entity  of 
government other than the State in a fiscal year and in the fiscal year immediately following it in 
excess  of  the  amount  permitted  to  be  appropriated  during  that  fiscal  year  and  the  fiscal  year 
immediately following it shall be returned by a revision of tax rates or fee schedules within the 
next two subsequent fiscal years. 

 
Article XIIIB also includes a requirement that 50% of all revenues received by the State 
in a fiscal year and in the fiscal year immediately following it in excess of the amount permitted 
to  be  appropriated  during  that  fiscal  year  and  the  fiscal  year  immediately  following  it  shall  be 
transferred and allocated to the State School Fund under Section 8.5 of Article XVI of the State 
Constitution.   

Article XIIIC and Article XIIID of the California Constitution 

 
On November 5, 1996, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 218, 
popularly known as the “Right to Vote on Taxes Act.”  Proposition 218 added to the California 
Constitution  Articles  XIIIC  and  XIIID  (respectively, “Article XIIIC”  and “Article XIIID”),  which 
contain a number of provisions affecting the ability of local agencies, including school districts, 
to levy and collect both existing and future taxes, assessments, fees and charges. 

 
According  to  the  “Title  and  Summary”  of  Proposition  218  prepared  by  the  California 
Attorney General, Proposition 218 limits “the authority of local governments to impose taxes and 
property-related assessments, fees and charges.”  Among other things, Article XIIIC establishes 
that  every  tax  is  either  a  “general  tax”  (imposed  for  general  governmental  purposes)  or  a 
“special  tax”  (imposed  for  specific  purposes),  prohibits  special  purpose  government  agencies 
such  as  school  districts  from  levying  general  taxes,  and  prohibits  any  local  agency  from 
imposing, extending or increasing any special tax beyond its maximum authorized rate without a 
two-thirds  vote;  and  also  provides  that  the  initiative  power  will  not  be  limited  in  matters  of 
reducing or repealing local taxes, assessments, fees and charges.  Article XIIIC further provides 
that  no  tax  may  be  assessed  on  property  other  than  ad  valorem  property  taxes  imposed  in 
accordance with Articles XIII and XIIIA of the California Constitution and special taxes approved 
by a two-thirds vote under Article XIIIA, Section 4.   

 
On November 2, 2010, Proposition 26 was approved by State voters, which amended 
Article XIIIC to expand the definition of “tax” to include “any levy, charge, or exaction of any kind 
imposed by a local government” except the following: (1) a charge imposed for a specific benefit 
conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and 

A-23 

 

which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit or 
granting  the  privilege;  (2)  a  charge  imposed  for  a  specific  government  service  or  product 
provided  directly  to  the  payor  that  is  not  provided  to  those  not  charged,  and  which  does  not 
exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of providing the service or product; (3) a 
charge imposed for the reasonable regulatory costs to a local government for issuing licenses 
and permits, performing investigations, inspections, and audits, enforcing agricultural marketing 
orders, and the administrative enforcement and adjudication thereof; (4) a charge imposed for 
entrance  to  or  use  of  local  government  property,  or  the  purchase,  rental,  or  lease  of  local 
government  property;  (5)  a  fine,  penalty,  or  other  monetary  charge  imposed  by  the  judicial 
branch  of  government  or  a  local  government,  as  a  result  of  a  violation  of  law;  (6)  a  charge 
imposed  as  a  condition  of  property  development;  and  (7)  assessments  and  property-related 
fees imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article XIIID.  Proposition 26 provides that the 
local government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy, 
charge, or other exaction is not a tax, that the amount is no more than necessary to cover the 
reasonable  costs  of  the  governmental  activity,  and  that  the  manner  in  which  those  costs  are 
allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor’s burdens on, or benefits 
received from, the governmental activity. 

 
Article  XIIID  deals  with  assessments  and  property-related  fees  and  charges,  and 
explicitly provides that nothing in Article XIIIC or XIIID will be construed to affect existing laws 
relating to the imposition of fees or charges as a condition of property development. 

 
Proposition 218 does not affect the ad valorem property taxes to be levied by the County 

to pay debt service on the Bonds. 

 

Proposition 62 

 
A statutory initiative (“Proposition 62”) was adopted by the voters at the November 4, 
1986, general election which (a) requires that any new or higher taxes for general governmental 
purposes  imposed  by  local  governmental  entities  such  as  the  District  be  approved  by  a  two-
thirds vote of the governmental entity’s legislative body and by a majority vote of the voters of 
the  governmental  entity  voting  in  an  election  on  the  tax,  (b) requires  that  any  special  tax 
(defined  as  taxes  levied  for  other  than  general  governmental  purposes)  imposed  by  a  local 
governmental entity be approved by a two-thirds vote of the voters of the governmental entity 
voting  in  an  election  on  the  tax,  (c) restricts  the  use  of  revenues  from  a  special  tax  to  the 
purposes or for the service for which the special tax was imposed, (d) prohibits the imposition of 
ad  valorem  taxes  on  real  property  by  local  governmental  entities  except  as  permitted  by 
Article XIIIA, (e) prohibits the imposition of transaction taxes and sales taxes on the sale of real 
property  by  local  governmental  entities,  and  (f) requires  that  any  tax  imposed  by  a  local 
governmental entity on or after August 1, 1985, be ratified by a majority vote of the voters voting 
in an election on the tax within two years of the adoption of the initiative or be terminated by 
November 15, 1988. 

 
California  appellate  court  cases  have  overturned  the  provisions  of  Proposition 62 
pertaining to the imposition of taxes for general government purposes.  However, the California 
Supreme  Court  upheld  Proposition 62  in  its  decision  on  August 28,  1995,  in  Fresno  County 
Transportation  Authority v.  Guardino. 
the  constitutionality  of 
Proposition 62.  Certain matters regarding Proposition 62 were not addressed in the Supreme 
Court’s decision, such as what remedies exist for taxpayers subject to a tax not in compliance 
with  Proposition 62,  and  whether  the  decision  applies  to  charter  cities.    The  District  has  not 
experienced any substantive adverse financial impact as a result of the passage of this initiative. 

  This  decision  reaffirmed

Proposition 98 
 

On November 8, 1988, California voters approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative 
constitutional  amendment  and  statute  called  the  “Classroom  Instructional  Improvement  and 
Accountability  Act”  (the  “Accountability  Act”).    Certain  provisions  of  the  Accountability  Act 
have,  however,  been  modified  by  Proposition  111,  discussed  below,  the  provisions  of  which 
became  effective  on  July  1,  1990.    The  Accountability  Act  changes  State  funding  of  public 
education below the university level and the operation of the State’s appropriations limit.  The 
Accountability  Act  guarantees  State  funding  for  K-12  school  districts  and  community  college 
districts  (hereinafter  referred  to  collectively  as  “K-14  school  districts”)  at  a  level  equal  to  the 
greater of (a) the same percentage of general fund revenues as the percentage appropriated to 
such  districts  in  1986-87,  and  (b)  the  amount  actually  appropriated  to  such  districts  from  the 
general fund in the previous fiscal year, adjusted for increases in enrollment and changes in the 
cost of living.  The Accountability Act permits the Legislature to suspend this formula for a one-
year period. 

 
The  Accountability  Act  also  changes  how  tax  revenues  in  excess  of  the  State 
appropriations  limit  are  distributed.    Any  excess  State  tax  revenues  up  to  a  specified  amount 
would, instead of being returned to taxpayers, be transferred to K-14 school districts.  Any such 
transfer to K-14 school districts would be excluded from the appropriations limit for K-14 school 
districts and the K-14 school district appropriations limit for the next year would automatically be 
increased  by  the  amount  of  such  transfer.    These  additional  moneys  would  enter  the  base 
funding calculation for K 14 school districts for subsequent years, creating further pressure on 
other portions of the State budget, particularly if revenues decline in a year following an Article 
XIIIB surplus.  The maximum amount of excess tax revenues which could be transferred to K 14 
school  districts  is  4%  of  the  minimum  State  spending  for  education  mandated  by  the 
Accountability Act. 

 

Proposition 111 
 

On  June  5,  1990,  the  voters  approved  Proposition  111  (Senate  Constitutional 
Amendment  No.  1)  called  the  “Traffic  Congestion  Relief  and  Spending  Limit  Act  of  1990” 
(“Proposition 111”) which further modified Article XIIIB and Sections 8 and 8.5 of Article XVI of 
the State Constitution with respect to appropriations limitations and school funding priority and 
allocation. 

 
The most significant provisions of Proposition 111 are summarized as follows: 
 
Annual Adjustments to Spending Limit.  The annual adjustments to the Article XIIIB 
spending limit were liberalized to be more closely linked to the rate of economic growth.  Instead 
of being tied to the Consumer Price Index, the “change in the cost of living” is now measured by 
the change in California per capita personal income.  The definition of “change in population” 
specifies that a portion of the State’s spending limit is to be adjusted to reflect changes in school 
attendance. 

 
Treatment  of  Excess  Tax  Revenues.    “Excess”  tax  revenues  with  respect  to  Article 
XIIIB  are  now  determined  based  on  a  two-year  cycle,  so  that  the  State  can  avoid  having  to 
return to taxpayers excess tax revenues in one year if its appropriations in the next fiscal year 
are under its limit.  In addition, the Proposition 98 provision regarding excess tax revenues was 
modified.  After any two-year period, if there are excess State tax revenues, 50% of the excess 

A-25 

 

 

are to be transferred to K-14 school districts with the balance returned to taxpayers; under prior 
law, 100% of excess State tax revenues went to K-14 school districts, but only up to a maximum 
of 4% of the schools’ minimum funding level.  Also, reversing prior law, any excess State tax 
revenues  transferred  to  K-14  school  districts  are  not  built  into  the  school  districts’  base 
expenditures  for  calculating  their  entitlement  for  State  aid  in  the  next  year,  and  the  State’s 
appropriations limit is not to be increased by this amount. 

 
Exclusions  from  Spending  Limit.    Two  exceptions  were  added  to  the  calculation  of 
appropriations which are subject to the Article XIIIB spending limit.  First, there are excluded all 
appropriations for “qualified capital outlay projects” as defined by the Legislature.  Second, there 
are excluded any increases in gasoline taxes above the 1990 level (then nine cents per gallon), 
sales and use taxes on such increment in gasoline taxes, and increases in receipts from vehicle 
weight  fees  above  the  levels  in  effect  on  January  1,  1990.    These  latter  provisions  were 
necessary  to  make  effective  the  transportation  funding  package  approved  by  the  Legislature 
and the Governor, which expected to raise over $15 billion in additional taxes from 1990 through 
2000 to fund transportation programs. 

 
Recalculation of Appropriations Limit.  The Article XIIIB appropriations limit for each 
unit of government, including the State, is to be recalculated beginning in fiscal year 1990-91.  It 
is based on the actual limit for fiscal year 1986-87, adjusted forward to 1990-91 as if Proposition 
111 had been in effect. 

 
School Funding Guarantee.  There is a complex adjustment in the formula enacted in 
Proposition 98 which guarantees K-14 school districts a certain amount of State general fund 
revenues.  Under prior law, K-14 school districts were guaranteed the greater of (1) 40.9% of 
State general fund revenues (the “first test”) or (2) the amount appropriated in the prior year 
adjusted for changes in the cost of living (measured as in Article XIIIB by reference to per capita 
personal  income)  and  enrollment  (the  “second  test”).    Under  Proposition  111,  schools  will 
receive the greater of (1) the first test, (2) the second test, or (3) a third test, which will replace 
the  second  test  in  any  year  when  growth  in per  capita  State  general  fund  revenues  from  the 
prior  year  is  less  than  the  annual  growth  in  California  per  capita  personal  income  (the “third 
test”).    Under  the  third  test,  schools  will  receive  the  amount  appropriated  in  the  prior  year 
adjusted  for  change  in  enrollment  and  per  capita  State  general  fund  revenues,  plus  an 
additional small adjustment factor.  If the third test is used in any year, the difference between 
the third test and the second test will become a “credit” to schools which will be paid in future 
years when State general fund revenue growth exceeds personal income growth. 

Proposition 1A and Proposition 22 

 
On  November  2,  2004,  California  voters  approved  Proposition  1A,  which  amends  the 
State  constitution  to  significantly  reduce  the  State's  authority  over  major  local  government 
revenue sources.  Under Proposition 1A, the State can not (i) reduce local sales tax rates or 
alter the method of allocating the revenue generated by such taxes,  (ii) shift property taxes from 
local governments to schools or community colleges, (iii) change how property tax revenues are 
shared  among  local  governments  without  two-thirds  approval  of  both  houses  of  the  State 
Legislature or (iv) decrease Vehicle License Fee revenues without providing local governments 
with  equal  replacement  funding.    Beginning,  in  2008-09,  the  State  may  shift  to  schools  and 
community  colleges  a  limited  amount  of  local  government  property  tax  revenue  if  certain 
conditions are met, including: (i) a proclamation by the Governor that the shift is needed due to 
a severe financial hardship of the State, and (ii) approval of the shift by the State Legislature 
with  a  two-thirds  vote  of  both  houses.    Under  such  a  shift,  the  State  must  repay  local 

A-26 

governments for their property tax losses, with interest, within three years.  Proposition 1A does 
allow  the  State  to  approve  voluntary  exchanges  of  local  sales  tax  and  property  tax  revenues 
among local governments within a county.  Proposition 1A also amends the State Constitution 
to require the State to suspend certain State laws creating mandates in any year that the State 
does not fully reimburse local governments for their costs to comply with the mandates.  This 
provision  does  not  apply  to  mandates  relating  to  schools  or  community  colleges  or  to  those 
mandates relating to employee rights. 

 
Proposition 22, a constitutional initiative entitled the “Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and 
Transportation Protection Act of 2010,” approved on November 2, 2010, superseded many of 
the provisions of Proposition 1A.  This initiative amended the State constitution to prohibit the 
legislature from diverting or shifting revenues that are dedicated to funding services provided by 
local  government  or  funds  dedicated  to  transportation  improvement  projects  and  services.  
Under  this  proposition,  the  State  is  not  allowed  to  take  revenue  derived  from  locally  imposed 
taxes,  such  as  hotel  taxes,  parcel  taxes,  utility  taxes  and  sales  taxes,  and  local  public  transit 
and transportation funds.  Further, in the event that a local governmental agency sues the State 
alleging a violation of these provisions and wins, then the State must automatically appropriate 
the funds needed to pay that local government.  This Proposition was intended to, among other 
things, stabilize local government revenue sources by restricting the State’s control over local 
property taxes. 

 
Because  Proposition  22  reduces  the  State’s  authority  to  use  or  reallocate  certain 
revenue sources, fees and taxes for State general fund purposes, the State will have to take 
other actions to balance its budget, such as reducing State spending or increasing State taxes, 
and school and college districts that receive Proposition 98 or other funding from the State will 
be more directly dependent upon the State’s general fund. 

 

 

 
 

Future Initiatives 
 

Article XIIIA, Article XIIIB, Article XIIIC and Article XIIID of the California Constitution and 
Propositions 98, 111, and 22 were each adopted as measures that qualified for the ballot under 
the  State’s  initiative  process.    From  time  to  time  other  initiative  measures  could  be  adopted 
further affecting District revenues or the District’s ability to expend revenues.  The nature and 
impact of these measures cannot be anticipated by the District.

To  the Governing  Board 
Wright Elementary School District 
Santa  Rosa,  California 

We  have  audited  the  financial  statements  of  the  governmental  activities,  each  major  fund,  and 
the  aggregate  remaining  fund  information  of  Wright  Elementary  School  District  for  the  year  ended 
June  30,  2013.  Professional  standards  require  that  we  provide  you  with  information  about  our 
responsibilities  under  generally  accepted  auditing  standards,  Government  Auditing  Standards,  and 
OMB  Circular A-133,  as well  as  certain information related to the planned scope and timing  of our audit. 
We  have  communicated  such  information  to  you  in  our  annual  engagement  letter.  Professional 
standards also require that we communicate to you the following  information related to our audit. 

Significant Audit Findings 

Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices 

Management  is  responsible  for  the  selection  and  use  of  appropriate  accounting  policies.  The 
significant accounting  policies  used  by Wright Elementary School  District are described in  Note 1 to the 
financial  statements.  As  described  in  Note  1 B  to  the  financial  statements,  the  Wright  Elementary 
School  District  changed  accounting  policies  related  to  reporting  deferred  outflows  of  resources, 
deferred  inflows  of  resources,  and  net  position  in  a  statement  of  financial  position  by  adopting  the 
Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  GASB  Statement  63,  Financial  Reporting  of 
Deferred Outflows of Resources,  Deferred Inflows  of Resources,  and Net Position,  in  fiscal  year 2012-
13.  We  noted  no  transactions  entered  into  by  the  District  during  the  year for which  there  is  a lack of 
authoritative  guidance  or consensus.  All  significant transactions  have  been  recognized  in  the financial 
statements in the proper period. 

Accounting  estimates are  an  integral part  of the financial  statements  prepared  by management and  are 
based  on  management's  knowledge  and  experience  about  past  and  current  events  and  assumptions 
about  future  events.  Certain  accounting  estimates  are  particularly  sensitive  because  of  their 
significance to the financial  statements and  because  of the  possibility that future  events  affecting  them 
may differ significantly from those expected. 

The financial  statement disclosures are  neutral, consistent,  and  clear. 

Difficulties Encountered in  Performing the Audit 

We encountered no significant difficulties in dealing with management in  performing  and  completing our 
audit. 

Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements 

Professional  standards  require  us  to  accumulate  all  known  and  likely  misstatements  identified  during 
the  audit,  other  than  those  that  are  trivial,  and  communicate  them  to  the  appropriate  level  of 
management.  Management has  been  notified  of all  such  misstatements.  The  material misstatements 
detected  as  a result of audit  procedures that were  corrected  by  management,  are  summarized  in  your 
District's 2012-13 audit report in the Supplementary Information Section on  the Reconciliation of Annual 
Financial and  Budget Report with Audited  Financial Statements.

Disagreements with Management 

For  purposes  of this  letter,  a  disagreement  with  management  is  a financial  accounting,  reporting,  or 
auditing  matter,  whether  or  not  resolved  to  our  satisfaction,  that  could  be  significant  to  the  financial 
statements  or the  auditor's  report.  We  are  pleased  to  report that no  such  disagreements  arose  during 
the  course of our audit. 

Management Representations 

We  have  requested  certain  representations  from  management  that  are  included  in  the  management 
representation letter dated December 9,  2013. 

Management Consultations with  Other Independent Accountants 

In  some  cases,  management  may  decide  to  consult  with  other  accountants  about  auditing  and 
accounting  matters,  similar  to  obtaining  a  "second  opinion"  on  certain  situations.  If  a  consultation 
involves application of an accounting  principle to the District's financial  statements or a determination of 
the  type  of auditor's  opinion  that  may  be  expressed  on  those  statements,  our  professional  standards 
require the  consulting  accountant to check with  us to  determine that the  consultant has  all  the relevant 
facts.  To our knowledge, there were no such  consultations with  other accountants. 

Other Audit Findings or Issues 

We  generally  discuss  a  variety  of  matters,  including  the  application  of  accounting  principles  and 
auditing  standards,  with  management each  year  prior to  retention  as  the  District's  auditors.  However, 
these  discussions  occurred  in  the  normal  course  of our  professional  relationship  and  our  responses 
were  not a condition to  our retention. 

Other Matters 

With respect to the supplementary information accompanying the financial statements, we  made certain 
inquiries  of management and  evaluated the form,  content,  and  methods  of preparing the information to 
determine  that  the  information  complies  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United 
States  of  America,  the  method  of  preparing  it  has  not  changed  from  the  prior  period,  and  the 
information  is  appropriate  and  complete  in  relation  to  our  audit  of  the  financial  statements.  We 
compared  and  reconciled  the  supplementary  information  to  the  underlying  accounting  records  used  to 
prepare the financial statements or to the financial  statements themselves. 

This  information  is  intended  solely  for  the  use  of  the  Governing  Board  and  management  of  Wright 
Elementary  School  District  and  is  not  intended  to  be,  and  should  not  be,  used  by  anyone  other than 
these specified  parties.

To the  Governing  Board and  Management of 
Wright Elementary School District 
Santa  Rosa,  California 

In  planning  and  performing  our  audit  of the  financial  statements  of the  governmental  activities, 
each  major  fund,  and  the  aggregate  remaining  fund  information  of  Wright  Elementary  School 
District  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2013,  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards 
generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America,  we  considered  Wright  Elementary  School 
District's  internal  control  over financial  reporting  (internal  control)  as  a basis  for designing  audit 
procedures that are  appropriate in the  circumstances  for the  purpose of expressing  our opinions 
on  the  financial  statements,  but not for the  purpose of expressing an  opinion on the effectiveness 
of the  District's internal  control.  Accordingly,  we  do  not express  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness 
of the  District's internal  control. 

Our  consideration  of  internal  control  was  for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the  preceding 
paragraph  and  was  not  designed  to  identify  all  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  might  be 
material  weaknesses  or significant deficiencies and,  therefore,  material weaknesses or significant 
In  addition,  because  of  inherent  limitations  in 
deficiencies  may  exist  that  were  not  identified. 
internal  control,  including  the  possibility  of management  override  of controls,  misstatements  due 
to  error or fraud  may  occur and  not be  detected  by  such  controls.  However,  as  discussed  below, 
we  identified  certain  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  we  consider to  be  material weaknesses 
and  other deficiencies that we consider to be significant deficiencies. 

A  deficiency  in  internal  control  exists  when  the  design  or  operation  of  a  control  does  not  allow 
management or employees,  in the  normal  course of performing their assigned functions,  to  prevent,  or 
detect  and  correct  misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.  A  material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or 
combination of deficiencies in  internal control,  such that there is  a reasonable possibility that a material 
misstatement of the  entity's financial  statements will  not  be  prevented,  or detected  and  corrected on  a 
timely  basis.  We  consider the  deficiency described  in  the  Schedule  of Findings  and  Questioned 
Costs  section  of this  year's  audit  report  to  be  a  material  weakness.  The  finding  is  identified  as 
"Material  Weakness"  in  the  Schedule  of  Findings  and  Questioned  Costs  section  of  the  audit 
report. 

A significant  deficiency  is  a deficiency,  or a combination  of deficiencies,  in  internal  control  that  is  less 
severe  than  a  material  weakness,  yet  important  enough  to  merit  attention  by  those  charged  with 
governance.  We consider the  deficiencies  described  in the Schedule of Findings and  Questioned 
Costs  section  of  this  year's  audit  report  to  be  significant  deficiencies.  These  findings  are 
identified  as  "Significant Deficiency" in the Schedule of Findings  and  Questioned  Costs section 
of the  audit report. 

This  communication  is  intended  solely  for  the  information  and  use  of  the  Governing  Board  and 
management of Wright Elementary School  District,  and  others within the  District,  and is  not  intended to 
be and should not be  used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Santa Rosa, California 

Report on  the Financial Statements 

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial  statements  of  the  governmental  activities,  each 
major  fund,  and  the  aggregate  remaining  fund  information  of  the  Wright  Elementary  School 
District,  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2013,  and  the  related  notes  to  the  financial 
statements,  which  collectively  comprise  the  District's  basic  financial  statements  as  listed  in  the 
table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is  responsible  for the  preparation  and  fair presentation  of these financial  statements 
in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America;  this 
the 
includes  the  design, 
preparation  and fair presentation  of financial  statements that are free from  material  misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 

implementation,  and  maintenance  of  internal  control  relevant  to 

Auditor's Responsibility 

Our responsibility  is  to  express  opinions  on  these  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We 
conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted  in  the  United 
States  of  America  and  the  standards  applicable  to  financial  audits  contained  in  Government 
Auditing  Standards,  issued  by the  Comptroller  General  of the  United  States.  Those  standards 
require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and 
disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor's 
judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial 
statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error. 
In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor 
considers  internal  control  relevant to  the  entity's  preparation  and fair presentation  of the financial 
statements  in  order to  design  audit procedures that are  appropriate  in  the circumstances,  but not 
for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  entity's  internal  control. 
Accordingly,  we express no such  opinion.  An  audit also  includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness 
of accounting  policies  used and the reasonableness  of significant  accounting  estimates made by 
management,  as well as evaluating the  overall presentation of the financial statements. 

We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have  obtained  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a 
basis for our audit opinions.

Opinions 

In  our opinion,  the financial  statements referred  to  above  present fairly,  in  all  material respects,  the 
respective  financial  position  of the  governmental  activities,  each  major  fund,  and  the  aggregate 
remaining  fund  information  of the Wright Elementary School  District,  as  of June  30,  2013,  and the 
respective  changes  in  financial  position  thereof  for  the  year  then  ended  in  accordance  with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the  United States of America. 

Other Matters 

Required Supplementary Information 

Accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  require  that  the 
management's  discussion  and  analysis  on  pages  4  through  14  and  the  budgetary  comparison 
information  on  page  45  be  presented  to  supplement  the  basic  financial  statements.  Such 
information, although  not a part of the  basic financial  statements,  is required by the Governmental 
Accounting  Standards  Board  who  considers  it  to  be  an  essential  part  of financial  reporting  for 
placing  the  basic  financial  statements  in  an  appropriate  operational,  economic,  or  historical 
context.  We have applied  certain  limited procedures to the  required  supplementary information  in 
accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America,  which 
consisted  of  inquiries  of  management  about  the  rnethods  of  preparing  the  inforrnation  and 
comparing  the  information  for  consistency  with  management's  responses  to  our  inquiries,  the 
basic  financial  statements,  and  other  knowledge  we  obtained  during  our  audit  of  the  basic 
financial  statements.  We do not express an  opinion  or provide  any  assurance on  the  information 
because the limited procedures do not provide us with  sufficient evidence to  express an  opinion or 
provide any assurance. 

Other Information 

Our  audit  was  conducted  for  the  purpose  of  forming  opinions  on  the  financial  statements  that 
collectively  comprise  Wright  Elementary  School  District's  basic  financial  statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) 

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 

(PREPARED BY DISTRICT MANAGEMENT) 

This section of Wright  Elementary School  District's annual financial report presents our discussion 
and  analysis  of  the  District's  financial  performance  during  the  fiscal  year  that  ended  on 
June 30,  2013.  Please  read  it in  conjunction  with the Independent Auditor's  Report presented on 
pages  1 through 3,  and the  District's financial statements, which immediately follow this section. 

USING THIS ANNUAL  REPORT 

This annual report consists of a series of financial  statements.  The Statement of Net Position and 
Statement of Activities,  presented on pages  16 and  17,  provide information  about the  activities  of 
the  District as a whole  and  present a longer-term view of the District's finances.  The fund financial 
statements  for  governmental  activities,  presented  on  pages  18  through  21,  provide  information 
about  how  District  services  were  financed  in  the  short-term,  and  how  much  remains  for future 
spending.  Fund  financial  statements  also  report  the  District's  operations  in  more  detail  than  the 
government-wide statements  by  providing  information  about the  District's  most significant funds. 
The  remaining  statement  provides  financial  information  about  activities for which  the  District  acts 
solely as  a trustee for the benefit of those outside the  District. 

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 

);>  The  District's  financial  status  declined  over  the  course  of  the  year  as  total  net  position 

decreased 5.2%.

revenues by $782,413 

);>  On  the Statement  of Revenues,  Expenditures,  and  Changes  in  Fund  Balances,  total current 
year  revenues  and  other financing  sources  exceeded  current  year  expenditures  and  other 
financing  uses  by  $5,461,393,  due mainly to  the current year issuance  of general  obligation 
bonds that remain  unspent at June 30,  2013. 

);>  Capital  assets,  net  of depreciation,  increased  $628,048,  due  to  the  current  year  acquisition 
and/or  construction  of  $1,294,162  of  new capital  assets  and  the  current  year  recognition  of 
$666,114 of depreciation expense. 

);>  Total  long-term  liabilities  increased  $7,048,274  due  primarily  to  the  $7,000,000  issuance  of 

general obligation  bonds in fiscal year 2012-13. 

);>  The  District's P-2  total  average  daily attendance  (ADA)  remained  relatively  stable,  increasing

increase of less than  1 %.

minimum  reserve  for economic uncertainty of 3%  of general fund  expenditures,  transfers  out, 
and  other  uses  (total  outgo).  During  fiscal  year  2012-13,  General  Fund  expenditures  and 
other  financing  uses  totaled  $12,553,576.  At  June  30,  2013,  the  District  has  available

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) 

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 

(PREPARED BY  DISTRICT MANAGEMENT) 

THE FINANCIAL REPORT 

The  full  annual  financial  report  consists  of  three  separate  parts,  including  the  basic  financial 
statements,  supplementary  information,  and  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis.  The  three 
sections together provide a comprehensive overview of the  District. The basic financial  statements 
are  comprised  of  two  kinds  of  statements  that  present  financial  information  from  different 
perspectives, government-wide and funds. 

~  Government-wide financial  statements,  which  comprise  the  first  two  statements,  provide 

both short-term and long-term information about the District's overall financial  position. 

~  Individual  parts of the  District,  which  are  reported  as  fund financial  statements  comprise 

the  remaining  statements . 

• :.  Basic services funding  is described in the governmental funds statements.  These 
statements  include  short-term  financing  and  identify  the  balance  remaining  for 
future spending . 

• :.  Short  and  long-term  financial  information  about  the  activities  of  the  District  that 

operate like businesses are  provided in the proprietary fund statements . 

• :.  Financial  relationships,  for which  the  District  acts  as  an  agent  or trustee for the 
benefit  of  others  to  whom  the  resources  belong,  are  presented  in  the  fiduciary 
funds statements. 

Notes to the financials,  which  are included  in the financial statements,  provide more detailed data 
and  explain  some  of the  information  in  the  statements.  The  required  supplementary  information 
provides  further  explanations  and  provides  additional  support  for  the  financial  statements.  A 
comparison of the District's budget for the year is  included. 

Reporting the District as a Whole 

The  District  as  a  whole  is  reported  in  the  government-wide  statements  and  uses  accounting 
methods similar to  those  used  by companies  in the  private  sector.  All  of the  District's  assets  and 
liabilities  are  included  in  the Statement  of Net  Position.  The Statement of Activities  reports  all  of 
the current year's revenues and expenses regardless of when cash  is  received or paid. 

The  District's  financial  health  (net  position)  can  be  measured  by  the  difference  between  the 
District's assets and liabilities. 

~  Increases  or  decreases  in  the  net  position  of  the  District  over  time  are  indicators  of 

whether its financial position is improving or deteriorating, respectively. 

);>  Additional  non-financial  factors  such  as  the  condition  of  school  buildings  and  other 
facilities,  and  changes  in  the  property  tax  base  of the  District  need  to  be  considered  in 
assessing the overall health of the District.

THE FINANCIAL REPORT (CONCLUDED) 

Reporting the  District as a Whole (Concluded) 

In  the  Statement  of Net  Position  and  the  Statement  of Activities,  we  divide  the  District  into  two 
kinds of activities: 

Govemmental Activities: 

The  basic  services  provided  by  the  District,  such  as  regular  education,  special  education,  and 
administration,  are included  here,  and  are  primarily financed  by property taxes  and  state formula 
aid.  Non-basic  services,  such  as  child  nutrition  are  also  included  here,  but  are  financed  by  a 
combination of local revenues,  and  state and federal  programs. 

Business-type Activities: 

The District does not provide any services that should be included in this category. 

Reporting the  District's Most Significant Funds 

The  District's  fund-based  financial  statements  provide  detailed  information  about  the  District's 
most  significant  funds.  Some  funds  are  required  to  be  established  by  State  law  and  bond 
covenants.  However,  the  District  establishes  many  other  funds  as  needed  to  control  and 
manage money for specific purposes. 

Govemmental Funds: 

The major governmental funds of Wright Elementary School District are the  General Fund, Capital 
Facilities  Fund,  and  Building  Fund.  Governmental  fund  reporting  focuses  on  how money  flows 
into and  out of the funds  and the balances that remain  at the end  of the  year.  A modified accrual 
basis  of accounting  measures cash  and  all  other financial  assets  that can  readily  be  converted  to 
cash.  The  governmental  fund  statements  provide  a  detailed  short-term  view  of  the  District's 
operations  and  services.  Governmental fund  information  helps to determine the  level of financial 
resources available in  the near future to finance the  District's programs. 

Proprietary Funds: 

Services for which  the  District  charges  a fee  are  generally reported  in  proprietary funds  on  a full 
accrual  basis.  These  include  both  enterprise funds  and  internal  service  funds.  Enterprise funds 
are considered  business-type activities and  are  also reported under a full  accrual method.  This  is 
the same basis  as  business-type activities; therefore  no reconciling  entries  are  required.  Internal 
service funds are reported with the Governmental Funds.  The  District has no funds of this type. 

Fiduciary Funds: 

The District  is  the trustee,  or fiduciary,  for its  student activity funds.  All  of the  District's fiduciary 
activities  are  reported  in  a separate  fiduciary  statement.  We  exclude  these  activities  from  the 
District's other financial statements because the District cannot use these assets to. finance their 
operations.  The  District  is  responsible  for ensuring  that the  assets  reported  in  these  funds  are 
used for their intended purposes.

Total  long-term  liabilities  increased  $7,048,274  due  primarily  to  the  issuance  of  $7,000,000  of 
general  obligation  bonds  in  fiscal  year 2012-13.  The  general  obligation  bonds  are  financed  by 
local  taxpayers  and  represent  97.2%  of  the  District's  total  long-term  liabilities.  The  liabilities 
related  to  compensated  absences,  early  retirement  incentives  and  termination  benefits  are 
financed  by  the  General  Fund  and  represent  2.0%  of the  total  long-term  liabilities.  The  District 
has satisfied  all  of its debt service requirements for its bonded debt and  continues to maintain an 
excellent credit rating on its current debt issues. 

The notes to the financial statements are an  integral part of the financial presentation and  contain

The  combined  fund  balances  of  all  District  funds  increased  $5,461,393,  which  includes  a 
$102,082  increase  in  the  General  Fund.  The  primary  reason  for  the  overall  fund  balance 
increase  is  due to the  issuance  of general  obligation  bonds  in  fiscal  year  2012-13  that  remain 
unspent at June 30,  2013. 

GENERAL FUND BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS 

The  District's  budget is  prepared  in  accordance with  California  law and  is  based on  the modified 
accrual  basis  of accounting.  Over the course  of the  year,  the  District  revises  its  budget  based on 
updated  financial  information.  The  original  budget,  approved  at  the  end  of  June  for  July  1,  is 
based  on  May  Revise  figures  and  updated  45  days  after the  State  approves  its  final  budget. 
In 
addition,  the  District  revises  its  budget  at  First  and  Second  Interim  to  reflect  the  most  current 
financial  information  available  at  that  point  in  time.  The  original  budget  presented  on  page  45 
includes only new revenues for fiscal  year 2012-13. 

ECONOMIC FACTORS BEARING ON  THE DISTRICT'S FUTURE 

The  2013-14  Budget  Act  and  related  trailer  bills  manifests  many  significant  improvements  and 
overdue  changes  to  California  Schools  funding  system.  We  recognize  that  these  are 
extraordinary  economic  times  and  though  the  implementation  of the  new Local  Control  Funding 
Formula  (LCFF)  brings  positive  changes  to  most  districts,  there  is  still  much  uncertainty. 
It  is 
currently  very  difficult  to  gauge  the  future  with  an  eight-year  phase-in  for full  implementation  of 
LCFF  and  complete details  have  yet  to  be  released  regarding  the  new funding  and  accountability 
requirements.  As  a  result,  school  district  budgets  should  continue  to  be  managed  with  a great 
degree  of  conservatism  over the  next  few  years.  The  District  has  an  excellent  track  record  in 
meeting  this  challenge  in  what  has  proven  to  be  a  cycle  of lean  years  and  prosperous  years  for 
education finances.

A. 

Financial Reporting Entity 

The  Wright  Elementary  School  Distric!  (the  "District")  is  a  public  educational  agency 
operating under the applicable laws and  regulations of the  State of California.  It  is governed 
by  a  five  member  Board  of  Education  elected  by  registered  voters  of the  District,  which 
comprises  an  area  in  Sonoma  County.  The  District  was  established  in  1865  and  serves 
students in  kindergarten through grade eight. 

The  District  accounts  for  its  financial  transactions  in  accordance  with  the  policies  and 
procedures  of  the  Department  of  Education's  California  School  Accounting  Manual.  The 
accounting  policies  of the  District  conform  to  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  as 
prescribed  by  the  Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board  (GASB)  and  the  American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). 

The financial reporting entity consists  of the following: 

»  The primary government 
»  Organizations for which the primary government is  financially accountable 
»  Other  organizations  for  which  the  primary  government  may  determine,  through 
exercise  of  management's  professional 
inclusion  of  an 
organization  that  does  not  meet  the  financial  accountability  criteria  is  necessary in 
order to  prevent the  reporting  entity's  financial  statements from  being  misleading.  In 
such instances, the organization should be  included as a component unit.

The  District  has  reviewed  criteria  to  determine  whether  other  entities  with  activities  that 
benefit  the  District  should  be  included  within  its  financial  reporting  entity  under  GASB 
Statement  No.  14  (GASB14)  as  amended  by  GASB  Statement  No.  61  (GASB  61),  The 
Financial  Reporting  Entity:  Omnibus,  and  has  determined  that  there  are  no  organizations, 
with  financial  activities that  benefit the  District,  which  shOUld  be  included  within  its  financial 
reporting entity under these criteria. 

The  District  has  also  reviewed  criteria  to  determine whether other  organizations,  for which 
the  Distric!  is  not  financially  accountable,  should  be  reported  within  its  financial  reporting 
entity,  based on the  nature  and  significance of its relationship with the  District,  under GASB 
Statement  No.  39  (GASB  39),  Determining  Whether Certain  Organizations are  Component 
Units,  and  has  determined  that  there  are  no  organizations,  for  which  the  District  is  not 
financially accountable, which should be reported within its financial reporting entity. 

B. 

Implementation of New Accounting Pronouncements 

In  June  of  2011,  the  Governmental  Accounting  Standard  Board  issued  Statement  No.  63 
(GASB  63)  Financial  Reporting  of Deferred  Outflows  of Resources,  Deferred  Inflows  of 
Resources,  and Net  Position,  with  required  implementation  for  the  District  during  the  year 
ended  June 30,  2013.  The  objective  of GASB  63  is  to  identify  net  position,  rather than  net 
assets,  as  the  residual  of all  other elements  presented  in  a statement  of financial  position. 
There  was  no  effect  on  beginning  net  positionlfund  balance  as  a  result  of  implementing 
GASB63.

Basis of Presentation 

Government-wide Financial Statements: 

The  government-wide  financial  statements  (i.e.,  the  Statement  of  Net  Position  and  the 
Statement  of Activities)  report  information  on  all  of the  non-fiduciary activities  of the  District 
and  its  component  units.  The  effect  of  interfund  activity  within  the  governmental  activities 
column  has  been  removed  from  these  statements.  Governmental  activities  normally  are 
supported by taxes and  intergovernmental revenues. 

The  government-wide  financial  statements  are  prepared  using  the  economic  resources 
measurement  focus.  This  is  the  same  approach  used  in  the  preparation  of the  proprietary 
fund  and  fiduciary  fund  financial  statements  but  differs  from 
the  manner  in  which 
governmental 
financial 
statements,  therefore,  include  a  reconciliation  with  brief  explanations  to  better  identify  the 
relationship  between

governrnental funds. 

financial  statements  are  prepared.  Governmental

the  government-wide  staternents  and 

the  staternents 

The  government-wide  staternent  of  activities  presents  a  comparison  between  direct 
expenses and  program  revenues for each function  or program  of the District's governmental 
activities.  Direct expenses are those that are specifically associated with a service, program, 
or department and are therefore clearly identifiable to a particular function.  The District does 
not allocate  indirect expenses  to  functions  in  the  statement  of activities.  Program  revenues 
include charges paid  by the recipients  of goods  or services  offered  by a program,  as  well  as 
grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital  requirements 
of  a  particular  program.  Revenues  which  are  not  classified  as  program  revenues  are 
presented  as  general  revenues  of the  District,  with  certain  exceptions.  The  comparison  of 
direct  expenses  with  program  revenues  identifies  the  extent  to  which  each  governmental 
function  is self-financing or draws from  the general revenues of the District. 

Fund Financial Statements: 

Fund  financial  statements  report  detailed  information  about  the  District.  The  focus  of 
governmental  fund  financial  statements  is  on  major  funds  rather  than  reporting  funds  by 
type.  Each  major governmental fund  is  presented  in  a separate  column,  and  all  non-major 
funds are aggregated into one column.  Fiduciary funds are reported  by fund type. 

The  accounting  and  financial  treatment applied to  a fund  is  determined  by its  measurement 
focus.  All governmental  funds  are  accounted  for using  a flow  of current financial  resources 
measurement focus.  With this measurement focus,  only current assets and  current liabilities 
are generally included on  the balance sheet.  The Staternent of Revenues,  Expenditures, and 
Changes  in  Fund  Balances  for  these  funds  present  increases  (i.e.,  revenues  and  other 
financing  sources)  and decreases (i.e.,  expenditures and other financing  uses) in  net current 
assets.  Fiduciary funds are  reported using the economic resources  measurement focus. 

D. 

Basis of Accounting 

Basis  of  accounting  refers  to  when  revenues  and  expenditures  are  recognized  in  the 
accounts  and  reported  in  the  financial  statements.  Governrnent-wide  financial  statements 
are  prepared  using  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting.  Governmental  funds  use  the  rnodified 
accrual basis of accounting.  Fiduciary funds use the accrual basis of accounting.

Basis of Accounting  (Concluded) 

Revenues - Exchange and  Non-exchange Transactions: 

Revenue  resulting  from. exchange  transactions,  in  which  each  party  gives  and  receives 
essentially equal  value,  is  recorded  under the accrual basis when the exchange takes place. 
Under  the  modified  accrual  basis,  revenue  is  recorded  in  the  fiscal  year  in  which  the 
resources  are  measurable  and  become  available.  "Available"  means  the  resources  will  be 
collected  within  the  current  fiscal  year  or  are  expected  to  be  collected  soon  enough 
thereafter to  be  used  to  pay  liabilities  of the  current fiscal  year.  For the  District,  "available" 
means  collectible  within  the  current  period  or  within  45,  60,  90  days  after  year-end, 
depending  on  the  revenue  source.  However,  to  achieve  comparability  of reporting  among 
California  Districts and  so  as  not to distort normal  revenue  pattems,  with  specific respect to 
reimbursement grants  and  corrections to  state  apportionments, the  Califomia  Department of 
Education has defined available as collectible within one year. 

Non-exchange transactions,  in  which  the  District receives  value without directly giving equal 
value  in  return,  include  property  taxes,  grants,  and  entitlements.  Under  the  accrual  basis, 
revenue from  property taxes  is  recognized  in  the  fiscal  year for which  the  taxes  are  levied. 
Revenue from  grants  and  entitlements  is  recognized  in  the  fiscal  year in  which  all  eligibility 
requirements have been  satisfied.  Eligibility requirements include timing requirements, which 
specify  the  year  when  the  resources  are  to  be  used  or  the  fiscal  year  when  use  is  first 
permitted;  matching  requirements,  in  which  the  District  must  provide  local  resources  to  be 
used  for  a  specific  purpose;  and  expenditure  requirements,  in  which  the  resources  are 
provided to the District on a reimbursement basis.  Under the  modified accrual basis,  revenue 
from non-exchange transactions must also be available before it can be recognized. 

Deferred Revenue: 

Deferred  revenue  arises  when  assets  are  received  before  revenue  recognition  criteria  have 
been  satisfied.  Grants  and  entitlements  received  before  eligibility requirements  are  met are 
recorded  as  deferred  revenue.  On  governmental  fund  financial  statements,  receivables 
associated  with  non-exchange  transactions  that  will  not  be  collected  within  the  availability 
period have also  been recorded as deferred  revenue. 

Expenses/Expenditures: 

On  an  accrual  basis  of  accounting,  expenses  are  recognized  at  the  time  a  liability  is 
incurred.  On 
the  modified  accrual  basis  of  accounting,  expenditures  are  generally 
recognized  in  the  accounting  period  in  which  the  related  fund  liability  is  incurred,  as  under 
the  accrual  basis  of  accounting.  However under the  modified  accrual  basis  of  accounting, 
debt service  expenditures,  as  well  as  expenditures  related  to  compensated  absences  and 
claims and judgments,  are  recorded only when  payment is due.  Allocations of cost,  such as 
depreciation and  amortization,  are not recognized  in the governmental funds. 

When  both  restricted  and  unrestricted  resources  are  available  for  use,  it  is  the  District's 
policy to use restricted resources first,  then  unrestricted resources as they are  needed.

E. 

Fund Accounting 

The accounts of the  District are organized on the basis of funds,  each  of which is considered 
to  be  a  separate  accounting  entity.  The  operations  of each  fund  are  accounted  for with  a 
separate  set  of  self-balancing  accounts  that  comprise  its  assets,  liabilities,  fund  equity  or 
retained  earnings,  revenues,  and  expenditures  or  expenses,  as  appropriate.  District 
resources  are  allocated to  and  accounted for in  individual funds  based  upon the  purpose for 
which  they are to be spent  and the  means  by  which  spending  activities are  controlled.  The 
District maintains the following  governmental fund  types: 

General Fund - The general fund  is used to  account for and  report all financial  resources not 
accounted for and reported  in  another fund. 

Special  Revenue  Funds  - Special  revenue  funds  are  used  to  account  for  and  report  the 
proceeds  of  specific  revenue  sources  that  are  restricted,  committed,  or  assigned  to 
expenditure  for  specified  purposes  other  than  debt  service  or  capital  projects.  Other 
resources  also may  be  reported  in  the  fund  if those  resources  are  restricted,  committed,  or 
assigned to the specified purpose of the fund. 

Debt  SelVice  Funds  - Debt  service  funds  are  used  to  account  for  and  report  financial 
resources  that  are  restricted,  committed,  or  assigned  to  expenditure  for  principal  and 
interest. 

Capital Projects Funds  - Capital  projects funds  are  used to  account for and  report financial 
resources  that  are  restricted,  committed,  or  assigned  to  expenditure  for  capital  outlays, 
including the acquisition or construction of capital facilities and other capital assets. 

The District's funds are organized into major, non-major, and fiduciary funds as follows: 

Major Governmental Funds: 

General Fund is  the  general  operating  fund  of the  District.  For financial  reporting  purposes 
the  financial  activities  and  balances  of  the  Deferred  Maintenance  Fund  and  the  Special 
Revenue - Special Reserve Fund  have been combined with the General Fund. 

Capital Facilities Fund is  used to  account for resources received from  developer impact fees 
assessed  under provision of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). 

Building  Fund  is  used  to  account  for  the  acquisition  andlor  construction  of  major  capital 
facilities  and buildings financed from the sale of general obligation bonds. 

Non-major Governmental Funds: 

Cafeteria Fund is  used to  account for revenues  received  and  expenditures  made to  operate 
the District's cafeteria program. 

Bond  Interest  and  Redemption  Fund  is  used  to  account  for  District  taxes  received  and 
expended to pay bond interest and redeem  bond principal and related costs.

Fund Accounting  (Concluded) 

Non-major Governmental Funds (Concluded): 

State School Building Lease - Purchase  Fund was  created  to  account for the  revenues  and 
expenditures  related  to  the  construction  of  the  J.X.  Wilson  School  permanent  addition, 
Wright School reconstruction,  and construction  of the  Robert L.  Stevens School. 

County School Facilities Fund is  used to  account for state apportionments  (Education Code 
Sections 17009.5 and  17070.10-17076.10). 

Capital Projects - Special ReselVe Fund is used to  account for expenditures made to  acquire 
or replace  equipment.  This  fund  is  also  used  to  account for redevelopment  agency  (RDA) 
funds received to use for land  acquisition and facilities construction and reconstruction. 

Fiduciary Funds: 

Agency Funds  are  used  to  account  for  assets  of  others  for  which  the  District  acts  as  an 
agent.  The  District maintains an agency fund to  account for the various  student body related 
accounts  maintained  at  each  school  site,  which  are  used  to  account  for  the  raising  and 
expending  of  money  to  promote  the  general  welfare,  and  educational  experience  of  the 
student body. 

F. 

Budgets and  Budgetarv Accounting 

Annual  budgets  are  adopted  on  a  basis  consistent  with  accounting  principles  generally 
accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  for  all  governmental  funds.  By  state  law,  the 
District's  governing  board  must  adopt  a final  budget  no  later than  July  1.  A  public  hearing 
must  be  conducted  to  receive  comments  prior to  adoption.  The  District's  Governing  Board 
satisfied these reqUirements. 

These  budgets are  revised  by  the  District's  Governing  Board  and  Superintendent during the 
year to  give  consideration  to  unanticipated  income  and  expenditures.  The  original  and  final 
revised budget is presented for the  General  Fund  as  required  supplementary information  on 
page 45. 

Formal  budgetary  integration  was  employed  as  a  management  control  device  during  the 
year  for  all  budgeted  funds.  The  District  employs  budget  control  by  minor  object  and  by 
individual  appropriation  accounts.  Expenditures  cannot  legally  exceed  appropriations  by 
major object account (See Note 3). 

G. 

Use of Estimates 

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  prinCiples  generally 
accepted  in  the  United  States  of America  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and 
assumptions  that  affect  certain  reported  amounts  and  disclosures.  Accordingly,  actual 
results could differ from those estimates.

Encumbrances 

Encumbrance  accounting  is  used  in  all  budgeted  funds  to  reserve  portions  of  applicable 
appropriations  for  which  commitments  have  been  made.  Encumbrances  are  recorded  for 
purchase  orders,  contracts,  and  other commitments  when  they  are  written.  Encumbrances 
are liquidated when the commitments are paid.  All encumbrances are liquidated at June 30.

Assets, Liabilities and  Eguity 

1.  Deposits and Investments 

The District is authorized to  maintain cash  in  banks and  revolving  funds that are insured 
to  $250,000  by the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 

The District is considered  to  be  an involuntary participant in an  external investment pool 
as  the  District  is  required  to  deposit  all receipts  and  collections  of  monies  with  their 
County Treasurer (Education Code Section 41001). 

The  County  is  authorized  to  deposit  cash  and  invest  excess  funds  by  California 
Government  Code  Section  53648  et  seq.  The  funds  maintained  by  the  County  are 
either secured by the FDIC or are collateralized. 

The District is authorized  under California Governrnent Code to make direct investments 
in  local  agency  bonds,  notes,  or warrants  within  the  State;  U.S.  Treasury  instruments; 
registered  State  warrants  or  treasury  notes;  securities  of the  U.S.  Government,  or  its 
agencies;  bankers  acceptances;  commercial  paper;  certificates  of deposit  placed  with 
loan  companies;  repurchase  or  reverse 
commercial  banks  and/or  savings  and 
repurchase  agreements;  medium  terrn  corporate  notes;  shares  of  beneficial  interest 
issued  by  diversified  management  cornpanies;  certificates  of  participation;  obligations 
with first priority security; and collateralized mortgage obligations. 

Investments  with  original. maturities  greater than  one  year  are  stated  at fair value.  Fair 
value  is  estimated  based  on  quoted  market  prices  at  year-end.  All  investments  not 
required to be reported at fair value  are stated at cost or arnortized cost. 

2.  Stores Inventory 

Inventory  is  recorded  using  the  purchase  method  in  that  the  cost  (handling  charge  for 
state surplus  food)  is  recorded  as  an  expenditure  at  the time  individual  inventory  items 
are purchased.  Inventory is valued at average cost and  consists  of expendable supplies 
held for consumption.  Reported  inventory is equally offset by  a reserve,  which indicates 
that this amount is not available for appropriation. 

3.  Prepaid Expenses 

Prepaid  expenses  consist  of the  costs  of  issuance  associated  with  the  bonds  issued 
since  the  implernentation  of GASB  Statement No.  34,  which  will  be  amortized  over the 
life  of  the  bonds.  Reported  prepaid  expenses  are  equally  offset  by  a  reserve,  which 
indicates that this amount is not available for appropriation.

Furniture  and  equipment purchased  or acquired  with  an  original  cost  of $5,000  or more 
are  reported  at  historical  cost  or  estimated  historical  cost.  Beginning  in  fiscal  year 
2009-10,  capital improvement acquisition or construction with  an  original cost of $20,000 
or  more  are  reported  at  historical  cost  or  estimated  historical  cost.  Contributed  assets 
are  reported  at  fair market value  as  of the  date  received.  Additions,  improvements,  and 
other capital  outlays  that  significantly  extend  the  useful  life  of an  asset  are  capitalized. 
The  costs of normal  maintenance and  repairs that do  not add  to  the  value  of the  assets 
or materially  extend the  asset's  lives  are  not  capitalized,  but  are  expensed  as  incurred. 
Depreciation  on  all  capital  assets  is  computed  using  a  straight-line  basis  over  the 
following  estimated useful lives:

5.  Deferred  Revenue 

Cash  received  for  federal  and  state  special  projects  and  programs  is  recognized  as 
revenue  to  the  extent that qualified expenditures  have  been incurred.  Deferred revenue 
is  recorded  to  the  extent that cash  received  on  specific projects  and  programs exceeds 
qualified expenditures. 

6.  Compensated Absences 

All  vacation  pay is  accrued when  incurred  in  the  government-wide financial  statements. 
Accumulated  sick  leave  benefits  are  not  recognized  as  liabilities  of  the  District.  The 
District's policy is to record sick leave as an operating expense in the period taken, since 
such  benefits  do  not  vest,  nor  is  payment  probable;  however,  unused  sick  leave  is 
added  to  the  creditable  service  period  for  calculation  of  retirement  benefits  when  the 
employee retires. 

7.  Long-term Liabilities 

In  the  government-wide  financial  statements,  long-term  debt  and  other  long-term 
obligations  are  reported  as  long-term  liabilities  in  the  Statement  of  Net  Position. 
Premiums and  discounts as  well as  issuance costs,  related to  long-term  liabilities  issued 
since  the  implementation  of GASB  Statement No.  34,  are  deferred  and  amortized  over 
the  life  of the obligation,  when  material to  the financial  statements.  Long-term  liabilities 
are reported net of the applicable premiums, discounts or issuance costs. 

In  the fund financial statements,  governmental funds recognize premiums and discounts 
as  well  as  issuance costs,  during the period  the  debt is  issued.  The  face  amount of the 
debt issued,  premiums,  and  discounts are  reported  as  other financing sources or uses.

fund 

financial  statements  present 

fund  balances  based  on 
The  governmental 
classifications  that  comprise  a  hierarchy  based  primarily  on  the  extent  to  which  the 
District is bound  to  honor constraints  on  the  specific purposes for which amounts  in  the 
respective  governmental  funds  can  be  spent.  The  allowable  classifications  in  the 
governmental fund financial statements are as follows: 

Nonspendable  Fund  Balance consist  of funds  that  are  inherently  nonspendable,  due  to 
their  form  (e.g.  inventories  and  prepaid  amounts),  or  that  are  legally  or  contractually 
required to  be  maintained intact. 

Restricted  Fund  Balance  consists  of  funds  that  have  limitations  on  use  that  are 
externally  enforceable  by  external  parties,  constitutional  provisions  or  enabling 
legislation. 

Committed Fund Balance consists  of funds  that  are  set  aside  for a specific purpose  by 
the  district's  highest  level  of  decision  making  authority,  the  Governing  Board.  The 
Governing  Board  may  corn mit  fund  balance  by  taking  formal  action,  such  as  majority 
vote  or  resolution,  no  later  than  June  30th
;  however,  the  amount  can  be  determined 
subsequent to  the  release  of the financial  staternents.  The same formal  action rnust  be 
taken by the Governing Board to remove  or change the  limitations placed on the funds. 

Assigned Fund Balance consists of funds that are set aside with the  intent to be used for 
a  specific  purpose  by  the  District.  The  Governing  Board  approved  a  resolution  giving 
authority to  assign  fund  balances to the  Superintendent with  the  recommendation  of the 
Business Manager and confirmed by the Governing  Board. 

Unassigned  Fund  Balance  consists  of  positive  net  resources  of  the  General  Fund  in 
excess  of what  can  properly  be  classified  in  the  previous  four  categories. 
Included  in 
this  fund  balance  category  is  the  Reserve  for  Economic  Uncertainty,  which  the  District 
will  maintain  in  an  amount  of at least  3%  of total  General  Fund  operating  expenditures 
(including other financing).  The primary purpose of this reserve  is  to avoid the need  for 
service  level  reductions  in  the  event  revenues  come  in  lower  than  budgeted.  The 
reserve  may  be  increased  from  time  to  time  in  order  to  address  specific  anticipated 
revenue shortfalls (state actions, etc.) 

The  District  considers  restricted  fund  balances  to  have  been  spent  first  when  an 
expenditure  is  incurred  for  purposes  for  which  both  restricted  and  unrestricted  fund 
balance  is  available.  Similarly,  when  an  expenditure  is  incurred  for  purposes  for which 
amounts  in  any  of the  unrestricted  classifications  of  fund  balance  could  be  used,  the 
District considers  cornmitted  amounts to  be  reduced first,  followed  by assigned amounts 
and then unassigned amounts. 

9.  Revenue Limit/Property Tax 

The  District's  revenue limit  is  received  from  a combination  of local  property taxes,  state 
apportionments,  and  other local sources.

9.  Revenue LimiUProperty Tax  (Concluded) 

The  County  of  Sonoma  is  responsible  for  assessing,  collecting  and  apportioning 
property  taxes.  Taxes  are  levied  for  each  fiscal  year  on  taxable  real  and  personal 
property in the county. 

The  levy  is  based  on  the  assessed  values  as  of the  preceding  January  1,  which  is  also 
the lien date.  Property taxes  on  the secured roll are due on  November 1 and  February 1, 
and  taxes  become  delinquent  after  December  10  and  April  10,  respectively.  Property 
taxes  on the unsecured roll are due on  the lien date  (January 1),  and  become delinquent 
if unpaid by August 31. 

Secured  property taxes  are  recorded  as  revenue when  apportioned,  in the fiscal year of 
the  levy.  The  county  apportions  secured  property  tax  revenue  in  accordance  with  the 
alternative  method  of distribution  prescribed  by  Section 4705  of the  California  Revenue 
and  Taxation  Code.  This  alternate  method  provides  for  crediting  each  applicable  fund 
with  its  total  secured  taxes  upon  completion  of  the  secured  tax  roll,  approximately 
October 1 of each year. 

The County Auditor reports the  amount of the  District's allocated property tax revenue to 
the  California  Department  of Education.  Property  taxes  are  recorded  as  local  revenue 
limit sources by the District. 

The  District's  Base  Revenue  Limit  is  the  amount  of general  purpose  tax  revenue,  per 
average  daily  attendance  (ADA),  that  the  District  is  entitled  to  by  law.  This  amount  is 
multiplied  by  the  applicable  attendance  period  ADA  to  derive  the  District's  total 
entitlement.  The  California  Department  of Education  reduces  the  District's  entitlement 
by  the  District's  local  property tax revenue.  The  balance is  paid  from  the State General 
Fund,  and is  known as the state apportionment.

I\JOTE 2 - DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED) 

Interest Rate  Risk 

Interest rate  risk  is  the risk  that  changes  in  market interest rate  will  adversely  affect the  fair 
value of an  investment.  Generally,  as  the  length of the maturity of an  investment increases, 
the  greater the  sensitivity  of its  fair value  to  changes  in  market interest rates.  The  District 
manages  its  exposure  to 
interest  rate  risk  by  investing  in  the  County  Treasury  that 
purchases  a  combination  of shorter term  and  longer term  investments  and  by  timing  cash 
flows from  maturities so that a portion  of the portfolio is  maturing  or coming close to  maturity 
evenly over time  as necessary to provide the cash  flow and liquidity needed for operations. 

Segmented Time Distribution 

Information  about  the  sensitivity  of  the  fair  value  of  the  District's  investment  to  market 
interest rate fluctuations  is  provided  by the following  schedule that  shows  the  distribution of 
the District's investment by maturity:

Credit Risk 

Credit risk  is the  risk  that an  issuer of  an  investment will  not fulfill its  obligation to  the  holder 
of the investment. This is  measured by the assignment of a rating  by a nationally  recognized 
statistical  rating  organization.  Presented  below  is  the  minimum  rating  required  by  the 
California  Government Code,  the  District's  investment  policy,  or debt  agreements,  and  the

Concentration of Credit Risk 

The  investment  policy  of  the  District  contains  no  limitations  on  the  amount  that  can  be 
invested  in  anyone  issuer  beyond  the  amount  stipulated  by  the  California  Government 
Code.  However,  the  District  does  not  hold  any  investments  in  anyone issuer,  at year-end, 
that represents five  percent or more of the total investments held by the District. 

Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits 

This  is  the  risk that in  the event of a bank failure,  the  District's deposits may not be returned 
to  it.  The District does not have a policy for custodial  credit risk for deposits.  However,  the 
California  Government  Code  requires  that  a  financial  institution  secure  deposits  made  by 
state  or  local  governmental  units  by  pledging  securities  in  an  undivided  collateral  pool  held 
by a depository regulated  under state law (unless  so waived  by the governrnental  unit).  The 

market value of the pledged  securities  in  the collateral  pool must equal  at least 11 ° percent 

of the total  amount deposited by the  public agencies.

Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits (Concluded) 

California law also allows financial institutions to secure public deposits by  pledging first trust 
deed  mortgage  notes  having  a  value  of  150  percent  of the  secured  public  deposits  and 
letters  of credit issued  by the  Federal  Home Loan  Bank  of San  Francisco having  a value  of 
105 percent of the secured deposits.  As of June 3D,  2013, the District does not have a bank 
balance that is exposed to  custodial credit risk. 

Custodial Credit Risk - Investments 

This is the risk that in the  event of the failure of the  counterparty,  the District will not be  able 
to  recover  the  value  of its  investments  or  collateral  securities  that  are  in  possession  of  an 
outside  party.  The  District  does  not  have  a  policy  limiting  the  amount  of securities  that can 
be  held by counterparties.  As  of June 3D,  2013,  the  District does not have any investments 
that are held by counterparties. 

Derivative Investments 

The District does not directly invest in  any derivative investments.  Information related to the 
use of derivative investments by the Sonoma County Treasury was not available.

NOTE 9 - TERMINATION  BENEFITS 

In  accordance  with  Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board  Statement  No.  47 
(GASB  47),  Accounting  for  Termination  Benefits,  termination  benefits  including  benefits 
provided by employers to  employees as an  inducement to hasten the termination of services 
should  be  recognized  when  the  employees  accept  the  offer  and  the  amounts  can  be 
estimated. 

Description of Benefit Arrangement: 

The  District  periodically  offers  an  early  retirement  incentive  for  members  of  the  Wright 
Educators' Association  (WEA) , the bargaining  unit representing  certificated employees of the 
District.  The  unit member must  have  reached  age  54  prior to  applying  for early retirement. 
The  unit  member  must  have  reached  the  age  of 55  by  the  beginning  date  of the  contract 
year  in  which  they  retire.  The  unit  member  must  have  retired  from  the  District  and  be  a 
partiCipant in  the State Teachers Retirement System  (CaISTRS). The unit member must also 
have  taught  in  the  District  for  a  minimum  of  10  years  or  be  at  least  at  salary  placement 
Column IV year  12.

NOTE 9 - TERMINATION BENEFITS  (CONTINUED) 

Description of Benefit Arrangement (Concluded): 

Benefits consist of a yearly stipend that can  be received  as  (1)  a monthly check,  (2) a single 
lump sum  payment,  or (3)  applied to  health  and  welfare  benefits of the  current  health  plans 
available  to  the  District  each  year  for  the  retired  unit  member  and  one  dependent,  the 
amount not to exceed the  contribution in the following table  by the  District.  The unit member 
will  receive  any  remaining  balance  on  a  monthly  check  and  will  pay  any  cost  above  the 
stipend amount.

$3,500  per year until June 30·h of the 

year the unit member turns 65 

No early retirement option available 

In the event of the death of the retiree  at age 64  or younger,  the dependent shall  receive,  as 
the sole remaining  compensation,  health and welfare coverage for twelve additional months. 
Stipend rights do not accrue to a surviving dependent. 

The  amounts  in  the  table  shown  above  have  been  in  effect for early  retirement  incentives 
offered  since  the  2004-05  school  year.  The  dollar  amounts  were  $7,000  and  $5,000, 
respectively,  for  incentives  offered  in  the 2003-04  school  year  and  earlier.  Two  retirees  are 
still  collecting  benefits  under  the  pre-2004-05  offers.  The  District  also  pays  the  1.45% 
employer's share of Medicare payroll taxes  on  amounts distributed each year. 

Cost of Termination  Benefits: 

For the  fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2013,  the  cost  of providing  these  benefits  for fourteen 
retirees  totaled  $66,229.  All  of  these  benefits  were  due  to  voluntary  terminations.  The 
$66,229 consisted of $65,282 in  cash  benefits  paid  directly to  retirees  and  $947  in  Medicare 
payroll taxes. 

The liability for the accrued termination  benefits payable at June 30,2013 is  $182,230.  The 
liability  consists  entirely  of voluntary  termination  benefits  to  be  paid  between  July  1,  2013 
and June 30, 2018 for the seventeen ongoing retirees. 

Significant Methods and Assumptions Used to  Determine Liabilities: 

Projections  of  benefits  for  financial  reporting  purposes  are  based  on  the  substantive  plan 
(the  plan  as  understood  by  the  employer  and  plan  members)  and  include  the  types  of 
benefits  provided  at  the  time  of  each  valuation  and  the  historical  pattern  of  sharing  of 
benefit  costs  between  the  employer  and  plan  members  to  that  point.  The  methods  and 
assumptions  used  include  techniques  that  are  designed  to  reduce  short-term  volatility  in 
actuarial  accrued  liabilities  and  the  actuarial  value  of assets,  consistent  with  the  long-term 
perspective of the calculations.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,  2013 

NOTE 9 - TERMINATION BENEFITS (CONCLUDED) 

Significant Methods and Assumptions Used to Determine Liabilities (Concluded): 

The plan's most recent actuarial  valuation  was performed as of June 30,  2010,  and updated 
as  of  June  30,2011.  The  actuarial  assumptions  included  a  1%  discount  rate  for the  first 
year,  increased  by  1 %  per year to  an  ultimate  discount rate of 4%  per year for fiscal  years 
beginning in  2014 and  thereafter.  This assumption  reflects  an  implicit long-term 3% general 
inflation  assumption.  The  1994  GAM  Mortality  Tables  (male  and  female)  were  used  to 
assign  a  probability  of death  prior to  age  65  to  current  retirees.  The  medicare  payroll  tax 
was assumed to be 1.45% for all future years. 

Benefits  under  GASB  47  are  recognized  and  expensed  at  the  time  that  they  become 
estimable  and  that  the  incentive  offer  has  been  accepted  by  the  retiree.  As  a  result,  no 
liability  for  future  retirees  was  included  in  the  "termination  benefits  payable"  figure  of 
$182,230. 

Future payments for this benefit are as follows:

least 3%  of total general fund expenditures, transfers out,  and other uses (total outgo). 

The  District  produced  operating  surpluses  of  $102,082  and  $39,129  during  fiscal  years  2012-13  and  2011-12,

14 ADA during fiscal  year 2013-14. 

Total  long-term  liabilities  increased  $6,945,702  over  the  past  two  years  due  primarily  to  the  $7,000,000  issuance  of

The  County.    One  of  California's  original  27  counties  (incorporated  in  1850),  Sonoma 
County (the "County") is the northernmost of the nine greater San Francisco Bay Area counties. 
Bordered on the north and east by Mendocino, Lake, and Napa counties and to the west and 
south  by  the  Pacific  Ocean,  Marin  County,  and  San  Pablo  Bay,  its  area  encompasses  1,598 
square miles. 

 
Geographically,  Sonoma  County  is  divided  almost  equally  into  mountainous  regions, 
rolling  hills  and  valley  land.  Three  narrow  valleys,  separated  by  mountains,  run  northwest  to 
southeast. Elevations range from sea level to 4,262 feet at Mt. Saint Helena, where Sonoma, 
Napa, and Lake counties converge.

Effective Buying Income 

 
“Effective  buying  income”  (“EBI”)  is  a  classification  developed  exclusively  by  Sales  & 
Marketing  Management  magazine  to  distinguish  it  from  other  sources  reporting  income  statistics.  
EBI is defined as “money income” less personal tax and non-tax payments - a number often referred 
to as “disposable” or “after tax” income.  Money income is the aggregate of wages and salaries, net 
farm  and  non-farm  self  employment  income,  interest,  dividends,  not  rental  and  royalty  income, 
Social  Security  and  railroad  retirement  income,  other  retirement  and  disability  ‘income,  public 
assistance income, unemployment compensation, Veterans Administration Payments, alimony and 
child  support,  military  family  allotments,  net  winnings  from  gambling  and  other  periodic  income.  
Money income does not include money received from the sale of property (unless the recipient is 
engaged  in  the  business  of  selling  property);  the  value  of  “in-kind”  income  such  as  food  stamps, 
public housing subsidies, medical care, employer contributions for persons, etc.; withdrawal of bank 
deposits;  money  borrowed;  tax  refunds;  exchange  of  money  between  relatives  living  in  the  same 
household;  gifts  and  lump-sum  inheritances,  insurance  payments,  and  other  types  of  lump-sum 
receipts.    EBI  is  computed  by  deducting  from  money  income  all  personal  income  taxes  (federal, 
state  and  local),  personal  contributions  to  social  insurance  (Social  Security  and  federal  retirement 
payroll deductions), and taxes on owner-occupied non-business real estate. 

 
The following table summarizes the total effective buying income for the City, the County, the 
State  and  the  United  States  for  the  period  2008  through  2012.    Effective  buying  income  data  for 
calendar year 2013 is not yet available.

Commercial Activity 

 

 
In 2009, the State Board of Equalization converted the business codes of sales and use 
tax permit holders to North American Industry Classification System codes. As a result of the 
coding change, retail stores data for 2009 is not comparable to that of prior years. A summary of 
historic  taxable  sales  within  the  City  during  the  past  five  years  in  which  data  is  available  is 
shown in the following table.  

 
Total  taxable  sales  during  the  first  quarter  of  calendar  year  2013  in  the  City  were 
reported  to  be  $650.1  million,  a  6.1%  increase  over  the  total  taxable  sales  of  $612.9  million 
reported during the first quarter of calendar year 2012. Annual figures are not yet available for 
calendar year 2013.

Members of the Governing Board: 

OPINION: 
 
 

$4,999,219.20 Wright Elementary School District 
(Sonoma County, California) General Obligation Bonds 
2012 Election, Series B 
 

 
We have acted as bond counsel to the Wright Elementary School District (the “District”) 
in connection with the issuance by the District of its Wright Elementary School District (Sonoma 
County, California) General Obligation Bonds, 2012 Election, Series B in the aggregate principal 
amount of $4,999,219.20 (the “Bonds”), under the provisions of Article 4.5 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 
of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code, commencing with Section 53506 of 
said  Code  (the  “Bond  Law”)  and  under  a  resolution  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District 
adopted  on  August  21,  2014  (the  “Bond  Resolution”).    We  have  examined  the  law  and  such 
certified proceedings and other papers as we have deemed necessary to render this opinion. 

 
As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon representations of 
the  District  and  in  the  certified  proceedings  and  certifications  of  public  officials  and  others 
furnished to us, without undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation. 

 
Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows: 
 
1. 

The District is duly created and validly existing as a school district with the power to 

issue the Bonds and to perform its obligations under the Bond Resolution and the Bonds. 

 
2.  The Bond Resolution has been duly adopted by the Governing Board of the District, 
and the Bond Resolution constitutes the valid and binding obligations of the District enforceable 
against the District in accordance with its terms. 

 
3.  The Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the District and are 
valid and binding general obligations of the District, and the Board of Supervisors of Sonoma 
County is obligated under the laws of the State of California to cause to be levied an ad valorem 
tax without limit as to rate or amount upon the taxable property in the District for the payment 
when due of the principal of and interest on the Bonds. 

D-1 

Interest  on  the  Bonds  is  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax 
purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum 
tax  imposed  on  individuals  and  corporations,  although  for  the  purpose  of  computing  the 
alternative minimum tax imposed on certain corporations, such interest is taken into account in 
determining certain income and earnings, and the Bonds are "qualified tax-exempt obligations" 
within the meaning of section 265(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Tax Code"), 
and, in the case of certain financial institutions (within the meaning of section 265(b)(5) of the 
Tax  Code),  a  deduction  is  allowed  for  80  percent  of  that  portion  of  such  financial  institutions’ 
interest  expense  allocable  to  interest  payable  on  the  Bonds.    The  opinions  set  forth  in  the 
preceding sentence are subject to the condition that the District comply with all requirements of 
the Tax Code which must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that 
interest  thereon  be,  or  continue  to  be,  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax 
purposes.  The District has covenanted in the documents relating to the Bonds to comply with 
each  of  such  requirements;  and  the  District  has  full  legal  authority  to  make  and  comply  with 
such covenants.  Failure to comply with certain of such requirements may cause the inclusion of 
such interest in gross income for federal income tax purposes to be retroactive to the date of 
delivery  of  the  Bonds,  or  may  cause  the  Bonds  not  to  be  “qualified  tax-exempt  obligations” 
within  the  meaning  of  section  265(b)(3)  of  the  Tax  Code.    We  express  no  opinion  regarding 
other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds. 

 

 
4. 

 
5. 

 
 

 

The interest on the Bonds is exempt from personal income taxation imposed by the 

State of California. 

 
The rights of the owners of the Bonds and the enforceability of the Bonds and the Bond 
Resolution  may  be  subject  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  and  other 
similar laws affecting creditors’ rights heretofore or hereafter enacted and may also be subject 
to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases. 

Respectfully submitted,

occurrence  with  the  MSRB,  in  an  electronic  format  as  prescribed  by  the  MSRB,  in  a  timely 
manner  not  in  excess  of  10  business  days  after  the  occurrence  of  the  Listed  Event.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice of Listed Events described in subsections (a)(8) and (9)

(a)(7), (a)(8) (if the event is a bond call), (a)(10), (a)(13), and (a)(14) of this Section 5 contain

respect to certain notices, determinations or other events affecting the tax status of the Bonds.  
The District shall cause a notice to be filed as set forth in paragraph (b) above with respect to 
any  such  event  only  to  the  extent  that  it  determines  the  event’s  occurrence  is  material  for 
purposes  of  U.S.  federal  securities  law.    Whenever  the  District  obtains  knowledge  of  the 
occurrence of any of these Listed Events, the District will as soon as possible determine if such 
event would be material under applicable federal securities law.  If such event is determined to 
be material, the District will cause a notice to be filed as set forth in paragraph (b) above.

governmental authority has assumed jurisdiction over substantially all of the assets or business 
of the District, or if such jurisdiction has been assumed by leaving the existing governing body 
and  officials  or  officers  in  possession  but  subject  to  the  supervision  and  orders  of  a  court  or 

E-4 

 

 

governmental  authority,  or  the  entry  of  an  order  confirming  a  plan  of  reorganization,

jurisdiction over substantially all of the assets or business of the District. 

 
Section 6. Identifying Information for Filings with the MSRB.  All documents provided to 
the MSRB under the Disclosure Certificate shall be accompanied by identifying information as 
prescribed by the MSRB.  

 
Section  7.    Termination  of  Reporting  Obligation.  The  District’s  obligations  under  this 
Disclosure Certificate shall terminate upon the legal defeasance or payment in full of all of the 
Bonds. If such termination occurs prior to the final maturity of the Bonds, the District shall give 
notice of such termination in the same manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5(b). 

 
Section 8.  Dissemination Agent. The District may, from time to time, appoint or engage 
a Dissemination Agent to assist it in carrying out its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate, 
and  may  discharge  any  such  Agent,  with  or  without  appointing  a  successor  Dissemination 
Agent. 

 
Section 9.  Amendment; Waiver. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Disclosure 
Certificate,  the  District  may  amend  this  Disclosure  Certificate,  and  any  provision  of  this 
Disclosure Certificate may be waived, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: 

(a) 

if  the  amendment  or  waiver  relates  to  the  provisions  of  Sections 
3(a), 4 or 5(a), it may only be made in connection with a change in circumstances 
that arises from a change in legal requirements, change in law, or change in the 
identity,  nature,  or  status  of  an  obligated  person  with  respect  to  the  Bonds,  or 
type of business conducted; 

the  undertakings  herein,  as  proposed  to  be  amended  or  waived, 
would, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with 
the  requirements  of  the  Rule  at  the  time  of  the  primary  offering  of  the  Bonds, 
after taking into account any amendments or interpretations of the Rule, as well 
as any change in circumstances; and 

 
(b) 

 
(c) 

the  proposed  amendment  or  waiver  either  (i)  is  approved  by 
holders  of  the  Bonds  in  the  manner  provided  in  the  Bond  Resolution  for 
amendments to the Bond Resolution with the consent of holders, or (ii) does not, 
in  the  opinion  of  nationally  recognized  bond  counsel,  materially  impair  the 
interests of the holders or beneficial owners of the Bonds. 
 
If the annual financial information or operating data to be provided in the Annual Report 
is  amended  pursuant  to  the  provisions  hereof,  the  first  annual  financial  information  filed 
pursuant hereto containing the amended operating data or financial information shall explain, in 
narrative  form,  the  reasons  for  the  amendment  and  the  impact  of  the  change  in  the  type  of 
operating data or financial information being provided. 

 
If an amendment is made to the undertaking specifying the accounting principles to be 
followed in preparing financial statements, the annual financial information for the year in which 
the change is made shall present a comparison between the financial statements or information 
prepared on the basis of the new accounting principles and those prepared on the basis of the 
former  accounting  principles.  The  comparison  shall  include  a  qualitative  discussion  of  the 

E-5 

 

 

differences  in  the  accounting  principles  and  the  impact  of  the  change  in  the  accounting 
principles  on  the  presentation  of  the  financial  information,  in  order  to  provide  information  to 
investors  to  enable  them  to  evaluate  the  ability  of  the  District  to  meet  its  obligations.  To  the 
extent reasonably feasible, the comparison shall be quantitative.  A notice of the change in the 
accounting principles shall be filed in the same manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5(b). 

 
Section 10. Additional Information. Nothing in this Disclosure Certificate shall be deemed 
to  prevent  the  District  from  disseminating  any  other  information,  using  the  means  of 
dissemination set forth in this Disclosure Certificate or any other means of communication, or 
including any other information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event, 
in  addition  to  that  which  is  required  by  this  Disclosure  Certificate.  If  the  District  chooses  to 
include  any  information  in  any  Annual  Report  or  notice  of  occurrence  of  a  Listed  Event  in 
addition to that which is specifically required by this Disclosure Certificate, the District shall have 
no  obligation  under  this  Disclosure  Certificate  to  update  such  information  or  include  it  in  any 
future Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event. 

 
Section 11.  Default. In the event of a failure of the District to comply with any provision 
of this Disclosure Certificate, any holder or beneficial owner of the Bonds may take such actions 
as may be necessary and appropriate, including seeking mandate or specific performance by 
court order, to cause the District to comply with its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate. 
A default under this Disclosure Certificate shall not be deemed an Event of Default under the 
Bond  Resolution,  and  the  sole  remedy  under  this  Disclosure  Certificate  in  the  event  of  any 
failure  of  the  District  to  comply  with  this  Disclosure  Certificate  shall  be  an  action  to  compel 
performance. 

 
Section  12. 

  Duties, 

Immunities  and  Liabilities  of  Dissemination  Agent.  The 
Dissemination Agent shall have only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Disclosure 
Certificate, and the District agrees to indemnify and save the Dissemination Agent, its officers, 
directors,  employees  and  agents,  harmless  against  any  loss,  expense  and  liabilities  which  it 
may incur arising out of or in the exercise or performance of its powers and duties hereunder, 
including the costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) of defending against any claim of 
liability,  but  excluding  liabilities  due  to  the  Dissemination  Agent’s  negligence  or  willful 
misconduct.  The  obligations  of  the  District  under  this  Section  shall  survive  resignation  or 
removal of the Dissemination Agent and payment of the Bonds. 

 
Section 13.  Beneficiaries. This Disclosure Certificate shall inure solely to the benefit of 
the District, the Dissemination Agent, the Participating Underwriters and holders and beneficial 
owners from time to time of the Bonds, and shall create no rights in any other person or entity.

APPENDIX F 

 

 

BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM 

The following description of the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), the procedures and 
record keeping with respect to beneficial ownership interests in the Bonds, payment of principal, 
interest  and  other  payments  on  the  Bonds  to  DTC  Participants  or  Beneficial  Owners, 
confirmation  and  transfer  of  beneficial  ownership  interest  in  the  Bonds  and  other  related 
transactions  by  and  between  DTC,  the  DTC  Participants  and  the  Beneficial  Owners  is  based 
solely  on  information  provided  by  DTC.  Accordingly,  no  representations  can  be  made 
concerning  these  matters  and  neither  the  DTC  Participants  nor  the  Beneficial  Owners  should 
rely on the foregoing information with respect to such matters, but should instead confirm the 
same with DTC or the DTC Participants, as the case may be.  

 
Neither  the  issuer  of  the  Bonds  (the  “Issuer”)  nor  the  trustee,  fiscal  agent  or  paying 
agent  appointed  with  respect  to  the  Bonds  (the  “Agent”)  take  any  responsibility  for  the 
information contained in this Appendix.  

 
No  assurances  can  be  given  that  DTC,  DTC  Participants  or  Indirect  Participants  will 
distribute to the Beneficial Owners (a) payments of interest, principal or premium, if any, with 
respect to the Bonds, (b) certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation or 
ownership interest in the Bonds, or (c) redemption or other notices sent to DTC or Cede & Co., 
its nominee, as the registered owner of the Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis, or 
that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this 
Appendix. The current “Rules” applicable to DTC are on file with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission  and  the  current  “Procedures”  of  DTC  to  be  followed  in  dealing  with  DTC 
Participants are on file with DTC. 

 
1.  The  Depository  Trust  Company  (“DTC”),  New  York,  NY,  will  act  as  securities 
depository for the securities (the “Securities”). The Securities will be issued as fully-registered 
securities  registered  in  the  name  of  Cede  &  Co.  (DTC’s  partnership  nominee)  or  such  other 
name  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized  representative  of  DTC.  One  fully-registered 
Security  certificate  will  be  issued  for  each  issue  of  the  Securities,  each  in  the  aggregate 
principal  amount  of  such  issue,  and  will  be  deposited  with  DTC.  If,  however,  the  aggregate 
principal amount of any issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to 
each $500 million of principal amount, and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to 
any remaining principal amount of such issue. 

 
2.  DTC,  the  world’s  largest  securities  depository,  is  a  limited-purpose  trust  company 
organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the 
New  York  Banking  Law,  a  member  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System,  a  “clearing  corporation” 
within  the  meaning  of  the  New  York  Uniform  Commercial  Code,  and  a  “clearing  agency” 
registered  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Section  17A  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934. 
DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity 
issues,  corporate  and  municipal  debt  issues,  and  money  market  instruments  (from  over  100 
countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates 
the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in 
deposited  securities,  through  electronic  computerized  book-entry  transfers  and  pledges 
between  Direct  Participants’  accounts.  This  eliminates  the  need  for  physical  movement  of 
securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and

dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is 
the  holding  company  for  DTC,  National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  and  Fixed  Income 
Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users 
of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both 
U.S.  and  non-U.S.  securities  brokers  and  dealers,  banks,  trust  companies,  and  clearing 
corporations  that  clear  through  or  maintain  a  custodial  relationship  with  a  Direct  Participant, 
either  directly  or  indirectly  (“Indirect  Participants”).  On  August  8,  2011,  Standard  &  Poor’s 
downgraded its rating of DTC from AAA to AA+. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants 
are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be 
found at www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org. The information contained on this Internet site is not 
incorporated herein by reference. 

 
3. Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct 
Participants,  which  will  receive  a  credit  for  the  Securities  on  DTC’s  records.  The  ownership 
interest of each actual purchaser of each Security (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded 
on  the  Direct  and  Indirect  Participants’  records.  Beneficial  Owners  will  not  receive  written 
confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive 
written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their 
holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into 
the  transaction.  Transfers  of  ownership  interests  in  the  Securities  are  to  be  accomplished  by 
entries  made  on  the  books  of  Direct  and  Indirect  Participants  acting  on  behalf  of  Beneficial 
Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in 
Securities,  except  in  the  event  that  use  of  the  book-entry  system  for  the  Securities  is 
discontinued.  

 
4. To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct Participants with 
DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name 
as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized  representative  of  DTC.  The  deposit  of  Securities  with 
DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect 
any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of 
the  Securities;  DTC’s  records  reflect  only  the  identity  of  the  Direct  Participants  to  whose 
accounts  such  Securities  are  credited,  which  may  or  may  not  be  the  Beneficial  Owners.  The 
Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on 
behalf of their customers. 

 
5. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by 
Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to 
Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or 
regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Securities 
may  wish  to  take  certain  steps  to  augment  the  transmission  to  them  of  notices  of  significant 
events  with  respect  to  the  Securities,  such  as  redemptions,  tenders,  defaults,  and  proposed 
amendments  to  the  Security  documents.  For  example,  Beneficial  Owners  of  Securities  may 
wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Securities for their benefit has agreed to obtain 
and  transmit  notices  to  Beneficial  Owners.  In  the  alternative,  Beneficial  Owners  may  wish  to 
provide  their  names  and  addresses  to  the  registrar  and  request  that  copies  of  notices  be 
provided directly to them. 

 
6. Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Securities within an 
issue are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of 
each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed.

7. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with 
respect to Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI 
Procedures.  Under  its  usual  procedures,  DTC  mails  an  Omnibus  Proxy  to  Issuer  as  soon  as 
possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting 
rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Securities are credited on the record date 
(identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). 

 
8. Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Securities will be 
made  to  Cede  &  Co.,  or  such  other  nominee  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized 
representative  of  DTC.  DTC’s  practice  is  to  credit  Direct  Participants’  accounts  upon  DTC’s 
receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from Issuer or Agent, on payable date in 
accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to 
Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the 
case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street 
name,”  and  will  be  the  responsibility  of  such  Participant  and  not  of  DTC,  Agent,  or  Issuer, 
subject  to  any  statutory  or  regulatory  requirements  as  may  be  in  effect  from  time  to  time. 
Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such 
other  nominee  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized  representative  of  DTC)  is  the 
responsibility of Issuer or Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be 
the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be 
the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. 

 
9.  DTC  may  discontinue  providing  its  services  as  depository  with  respect  to  the 
Securities  at  any  time  by  giving  reasonable  notice  to  Issuer  or  Agent.  Under  such 
circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificates are 
required to be printed and delivered. 

 
10.  Issuer  may  decide  to  discontinue  use  of  the  system  of  book-entry-only  transfers 
through DTC (or a successor securities depository).  In  that  event,  Security  certificates  will  be 
printed and delivered to DTC. 

 
11. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has 
been obtained from sources that Issuer believes to be reliable, but Issuer takes no responsibility 
for the accuracy thereof.

BUILD  AMERICA  MUTUAL  ASSURANCE  COMPANY  (“BAM”),  for  consideration  received,  hereby 
UNCONDITIONALLY  AND  IRREVOCABLY  agrees  to  pay  to  the  trustee  (the  “Trustee”)  or  paying  agent  (the  “Paying 
Agent”) for the Bonds named above (as set forth in the documentation providing for the issuance and securing of the Bonds), 
for the benefit of the Owners or, at the election of BAM, directly to each Owner, subject only to the terms of this Policy (which 
includes  each  endorsement  hereto),  that  portion  of  the  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  that  shall  become  Due  for 
Payment but shall be unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Issuer. 

On  the  later  of  the  day  on  which  such  principal  and  interest  becomes  Due  for  Payment  or  the  first  Business  Day 
following  the  Business  Day  on  which  BAM  shall  have  received  Notice  of  Nonpayment,  BAM  will  disburse  (but  without 
duplication in the case of duplicate claims for the same Nonpayment) to or for the benefit of each Owner of the Bonds, the face 
amount of principal of and interest on the Bonds that is then Due for Payment but is then unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by 
the  Issuer,  but  only  upon  receipt  by  BAM,  in  a  form  reasonably  satisfactory  to  it,  of  (a)  evidence  of  the  Owner’s  right  to 
receive payment of such  principal or interest then Due for Payment and (b) evidence, including any appropriate instruments of 
assignment, that all of the Owner’s rights with respect to payment of such principal or interest that is Due for Payment shall 
thereupon vest in BAM. A Notice of Nonpayment will be deemed received on a given Business Day if it is received prior to 
1:00 p.m. (New York time) on such Business Day; otherwise, it will be deemed received on the next Business Day.  If any 
Notice of Nonpayment received by BAM is incomplete, it shall be deemed not to have been received by BAM for purposes of 
the preceding sentence, and BAM shall promptly so advise the Trustee, Paying Agent or Owner, as appropriate, any of whom 
may submit an amended Notice of Nonpayment.  Upon disbursement under this Policy in respect of a Bond and to the extent of 
such  payment,  BAM  shall  become  the  owner  of  such  Bond,  any  appurtenant  coupon  to  such  Bond  and  right  to  receipt  of 
payment  of  principal  of  or  interest  on  such  Bond  and  shall  be  fully  subrogated  to  the  rights  of  the  Owner,  including  the 
Owner’s right to receive payments under such Bond. Payment by BAM either to the Trustee or Paying Agent for the benefit of 
the Owners, or directly to the Owners, on account of any Nonpayment shall discharge the obligation of BAM under this Policy 
with respect to said Nonpayment. 

Except  to  the  extent  expressly  modified  by  an  endorsement  hereto,  the  following  terms  shall  have  the  meanings 
specified for all purposes of this Policy.  “Business Day” means any day other than (a) a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on 
which banking institutions in the State of New York or the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent (as defined herein) are authorized or required 
by law or executive order to remain closed.  “Due for Payment” means (a) when referring to the principal of a Bond, payable 
on  the  stated  maturity  date  thereof  or  the  date  on  which  the  same  shall  have  been  duly  called  for  mandatory  sinking  fund 
redemption and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call for redemption (other than by 
mandatory  sinking  fund  redemption),  acceleration  or  other  advancement  of  maturity  (unless  BAM  shall  elect,  in  its  sole 
discretion, to pay such principal due upon such acceleration together with any accrued interest to the date of acceleration) and 
(b) when referring to interest on a Bond, payable on the stated date for payment of interest. “Nonpayment” means, in respect of 
a Bond, the failure of the Issuer to have provided sufficient funds to the Trustee or, if there is no Trustee, to the Paying Agent 
for payment in full of all principal and interest that is Due for Payment on such Bond.  “Nonpayment” shall also include, in 
respect of a Bond, any payment made to an Owner by or on behalf of the Issuer of principal or interest that is Due for Payment, 
which payment has been recovered from such Owner pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code in accordance with a final, 
nonappealable order of a court having competent jurisdiction.  “Notice” means delivery to BAM of a notice of claim and certificate, 
by certified mail, email or telecopy as set forth on the attached Schedule or other acceptable electronic delivery, in a form satisfactory 
to BAM, from and signed by an Owner, the Trustee or the Paying Agent, which notice shall specify (a) the person or entity making 
the claim, (b) the Policy Number, (c) the claimed amount, (d) payment instructions and (e) the date such claimed amount becomes or 
became Due for Payment.  “Owner” means, in respect of a Bond, the person or entity who, at the time of Nonpayment, is entitled 
under the terms of such Bond to payment thereof, except that “Owner” shall not include the Issuer, the Member or any other person 
or entity whose direct or indirect obligation constitutes the underlying security for the Bonds. 
 

 

BAM may appoint a fiscal agent (the “Insurer’s Fiscal Agent”) for purposes of this Policy by giving written notice to the 
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Member and the Issuer specifying the name and notice address of the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent.  From 
and  after  the  date  of  receipt  of  such  notice  by  the  Trustee,  the  Paying  Agent,  the  Member  or  the  Issuer  (a)  copies  of  all  notices 
required to be delivered to BAM pursuant to this Policy shall be simultaneously delivered to the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent and to BAM 
and shall not be deemed received until received by both and (b) all payments required to be made by BAM under this Policy may be 
made directly by BAM or by the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent on behalf of BAM.  The Insurer’s Fiscal Agent is the agent of BAM only, 
and the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent shall in no event be liable to the Trustee, Paying Agent or any Owner for any act of the Insurer’s Fiscal 
Agent or any failure of BAM to deposit or cause to be deposited sufficient funds to make payments due under this Policy. 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, BAM agrees not to assert, and hereby waives, only for the benefit of each 
Owner, all rights (whether by counterclaim, setoff or otherwise) and defenses (including, without limitation, the defense of fraud), 
whether acquired by subrogation, assignment or otherwise, to the extent that such rights and defenses may be available to BAM to 
avoid payment of its obligations under this Policy in accordance with the express provisions of this Policy.  This Policy may not be 
canceled or revoked. 

This Policy sets forth in full the undertaking of BAM and shall not be modified, altered or affected by any other agreement 
or instrument, including any modification or amendment thereto.  Except to the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, 
any premium paid in respect of this Policy is nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever, including payment, or provision being made 
for payment, of the Bonds prior to maturity.  This Policy is being issued under and pursuant to, and shall be construed under and 
governed by, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law provisions. THIS POLICY IS NOT COVERED 
BY  THE  PROPERTY/CASUALTY  INSURANCE  SECURITY  FUND  SPECIFIED  IN  ARTICLE  76  OF  THE  NEW  YORK 
INSURANCE LAW.  THIS POLICY IS ISSUED WITHOUT CONTINGENT MUTUAL LIABILITY FOR ASSESSMENT.  

In witness whereof, BUILD AMERICA MUTUAL ASSURANCE COMPANY has caused this Policy to be executed on its 

behalf by its Authorized Officer.
