RATINGS: (See “RATINGS” herein)

In the opinion of Robinson & Pearman LLP, Bond Counsel, under existing law, interest on the Series A Bonds and the Series B Bonds is exempt from 
personal income taxes of the State of California.  Bond Counsel is further of the opinion that, under existing law and assuming compliance with the tax 
covenants described herein, interest on the Series B Bonds is excluded pursuant to section 103(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the gross 
income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax.  Bond 
Counsel expresses no opinion as to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on the Series A Bonds or regarding any other 
federal tax consequence relating to the accrual or receipt of interest on the Series A Bonds or the Series B Bonds.  See “TAX MATTERS” herein.

The $17,230,000 Public Facilities Financing Authority of the City of San Diego, California (the “Authority”), Pooled Financing Bonds, 2007 Series A 
(Taxable) (Southcrest, Central Imperial and Mount Hope Redevelopment Projects) (the “Series A Bonds” or “Taxable Bonds”) and the $17,755,000 Public 
Facilities Financing Authority of the City of San Diego, California, Pooled Financing Bonds, 2007 Series B (Tax-Exempt) (Southcrest and Central Imperial 
Redevelopment Projects) (the “Series B Bonds” or “Tax-Exempt Bonds” and together with the Taxable Bonds, the “Bonds”) will be issued to (i) make loans 
to the Redevelopment Agency of the City of San Diego (the “Agency”) to be used for financing and refinancing redevelopment activities in the Southcrest 
Redevelopment Project Area, Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area and the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area (each a “Redevelopment 
Project Area” and collectively, the “Redevelopment Project Areas”), (ii) pay the costs of bond insurance for the Bonds, (iii) fund reserve accounts under the 
Loan Agreements which secure the Bonds and (iv) pay the costs of issuance incurred in connection with the Bonds.  See “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND 
USES OF FUNDS” herein.

The Taxable Bonds are being issued pursuant to an Indenture of Trust, dated as of June 1, 2007, by and between the Authority and The Bank of New 
York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”) (the “Taxable Indenture”) and the Tax-Exempt Bonds are being issued pursuant to a separate Indenture 
of Trust, dated as of June 1, 2007, by and between the Authority and Trustee (the “Tax-Exempt Indenture” and together with the Taxable Indenture, the 
“Indentures”) in fully registered form, and when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of the Depository Trust Company 
(“DTC”), New York, New York.  DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds.  Individual purchases of the Bonds may be made in book-entry form 
only, in denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof.  Purchasers of interests in the Bonds will not receive certificates from the Authority or 
the Trustee representing their interest in the Bonds purchased.  Interest on the Bonds will be payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, 
commencing October 1, 2007.  Payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds will be payable by the Trustee, to DTC, which is obligated 
in turn to remit such principal, premium, if any, and interest to the DTC Participants for subsequent disbursement to the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds, 
as more fully described herein.

The Bonds are subject to optional and mandatory redemption as described herein.  See “THE BONDS – REDEMPTION” herein.
The Bonds are obligations of the Authority, payable exclusively from, and secured by a first lien and pledge on the Revenues and certain other moneys 
held under the respective Indentures.  The “Revenues” for each series of Bonds primarily consist of all amounts payable by the Agency to the Authority 
for such series of Bonds pursuant to (1) the Loan Agreement and Third Supplemental Trust Agreement (Southcrest Redevelopment Project), dated as of 
June 1, 2007, by and among the Authority, the Trustee and the Agency relating to the tax-exempt loan of $9,405,000 and the taxable loan of $7,605,000 to 
the Agency with respect to the Southcrest Redevelopment Project (the “Southcrest Loan Agreement”); (2) the Loan Agreement and Second Supplemental 
Trust Agreement (Central Imperial Redevelopment Project), dated as of June 1, 2007, by and among the Authority, the Trustee and the Agency relating to the 
tax-exempt loan of $8,350,000 and the taxable loan of $6,515,000 to the Agency with respect to the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project (the “Central 
Imperial Loan Agreement”) and (3) the Loan Agreement and Fourth Supplemental Trust Agreement (Mount Hope Redevelopment Project), dated as of 
June 1, 2007, by and among the Authority, the Trustee and the Agency relating to the taxable loan of $3,110,000 to the Agency with respect to the Mount 
Hope  Redevelopment  Project  (the  “Mount  Hope  Loan Agreement”  and  together  with  the  Southcrest  Loan Agreement  and  the  Central  Imperial  Loan 
Agreement, the “Loan Agreements”).  The payments due under the Southcrest Loan Agreement are payable from certain tax increment revenues derived 
from the Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area, as described herein.  The payments due under the Central Imperial Loan Agreement are payable from 
certain tax increment revenues derived from the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area, as described herein.  The payments due under the Mount 
Hope Loan Agreement are payable from certain tax increment revenues derived from the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area, as described herein.  
There is no cross-collateralization between the Loan Agreements; tax increment revenues collected from one Redevelopment Project Area will not be 
available to pay loan payments due on the Loan Agreements for other Redevelopment Project Areas.  A payment default under one Loan Agreement could 
cause a payment default on one or both series of the Bonds to the extent that funds in the applicable reserve account is insufficient to pay debt service on 
that portion of the Bonds.  See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS” herein.  

Payment of principal of and interest on the Series A Bonds and the Series B Bonds will be insured in accordance with the terms of separate financial 

guaranty insurance policies to be issued simultaneously with the delivery of the Taxable Bonds and the Tax-Exempt Bonds by

The  Bonds  are  not  a  debt  of  the  City  of  San  Diego  (the  “City”),  the Agency,  the  State  of  California  (the  “State”),  or  any  of  its  political 
subdivisions, and neither the City, said Agency, the State, nor any of its political subdivisions is liable hereon, nor in any event shall the Bonds be 
payable out of any funds or properties other than those of the Authority and Agency specified in the Indenture.  The Bonds do not constitute an 
indebtedness of the Agency or the Authority within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction. 

The Bonds are separately offered, when, as and if issued by the Authority, subject to approval as to validity by Robinson & Pearman LLP, La Jolla, 
California, Bond Counsel, and to certain other conditions.  Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the Agency by Hawkins Delafield & Wood LLP, Los 
Angeles, California, Disclosure Counsel to the Agency, and by the City Attorney, serving as General Counsel to the Agency.  It is expected that the Bonds 
will be available through the facilities of DTC in New York, New York on or about July 12, 2007.

information  regarding  the  $17,230,000  Public  Facilities  Financing  Authority  of  the  City  of  San  Diego, 
California (the “Authority”), Pooled Financing Bonds, 2007 Series A (Taxable) (Southcrest, Central Imperial 
and Mount Hope Redevelopment Projects) (the “Series A Bonds” or “Taxable Bonds”) and the $17,755,000 
Public Facilities Financing Authority of the City of San Diego, California (the “Authority”), Pooled Financing 
Bonds, 2007 Series B (Tax-Exempt) (Southcrest and Central Imperial Redevelopment Projects) (the “Series B 
Bonds” or “Tax-Exempt Bonds” and together with the Taxable Bonds, the “Bonds”).  The Bonds are being 
issued by the Authority to make loans (collectively, the “Loans”) to the Redevelopment Agency of the City of 
San Diego (the “Agency”) to be used for financing and refinancing redevelopment activities in the Southcrest 
Redevelopment  Project  Area,  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Project  Area  and  the  Mount  Hope 
Redevelopment  Project  Area  (collectively,  the  “Redevelopment  Project  Areas”  and  each  a  “Redevelopment 
Project Area”).  See “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS” herein.  

The Bonds 

The Bonds are being issued by the Authority pursuant to the Mark-Roos Local Bond Pooling Act of 
1985,  constituting  Article 4  of  Chapter 5  of  Division 7  of  Title 1  (commencing  with  Section  6584)  of  the 
Government Code of the State (the “JPA Law”) and, with respect to the Taxable Bonds, an Indenture of Trust, 
dated as of June 1, 2007 (the “Taxable Indenture”), by and between the Authority and The Bank of New York 
Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and, with respect to the Tax-Exempt Bonds, an Indenture of Trust dated as of 
June 1, 2007 (the “Tax-Exempt Indenture”) by and between the Authority and the Trustee.  The terms of the 
Taxable Indenture and the Tax-Exempt Indenture are similar except with respect to certain covenants relating 
to the issuance of tax-exempt bonds and references herein to “Indenture” refers to, with respect to the Taxable 
Bonds, the Taxable Indenture, and with respect to the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the Tax-Exempt Indenture. 

The Loans 

The proceeds of the Bonds are being used by the Authority to make five separate Loans to the Agency 
for  the  three  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  pursuant  to  the  following  documents  (1)  the  Master  Trust 
Agreement  (Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project),  as  supplemented  by  the  Loan  Agreement  and  Third 
Supplemental Trust Agreement (Southcrest Redevelopment Project), dated as of June 1, 2007, by and among 
the Authority, the Trustee and the Agency relating to the tax-exempt loan of $9,405,000 and the taxable loan of 
$7,605,000  to  the  Agency  with  respect  to  the  Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project  (the  “Southcrest  Loan 

1 

 

 

Agreement”); (2) the Master Trust Agreement (Central Imperial Redevelopment Project), as supplemented by 
the Loan Agreement and Second Supplemental Trust Agreement (Central Imperial Redevelopment Project), 
dated as of June 1, 2007, by and among the Authority, the Trustee and the Agency relating to the tax-exempt 
loan  of  $8,350,000  and  the  taxable  loan  of  $6,515,000  to  the  Agency  with  respect  to  the  Central  Imperial 
Redevelopment Project (the “Central Imperial Loan Agreement”); and (3) the Master Trust Agreement (Mount 
Hope  Redevelopment  Project),  as  supplemented  by  the  Loan  Agreement  and  Fourth  Supplemental  Trust 
Agreement (Mount Hope Redevelopment Project), dated as of June 1, 2007, by and among the Authority, the 
Trustee and the Agency relating to the taxable loan of $3,110,000 to the Agency with respect to the Mount 
Hope  Redevelopment  Project  (the  “Mount  Hope  Loan  Agreement”  and  together  with  the  Southcrest  Loan 
Agreement and the Central Imperial Loan Agreement, the “Loan Agreements” and each individually a “Loan 
Agreement”).  See “Appendix C – SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS” herein. 

The  Loans  are  being  entered  into  by  the  Agency  under  the  Loan  Agreements  pursuant  to  the 
Constitution (the “Constitution”) and laws of the State of California (the “State”), including the Community 
Redevelopment Law (Section 33000 et seq. of the Health and Safety Code of the State) (the “Redevelopment 
Law”),  the  JPA  Law  and  Section  53580 et  seq.  of the  Government  Code of  the State.  The proceeds of  the 
Loans will be used by the Agency to refund certain existing indebtedness in each of the Redevelopment Project 
Areas,  to  finance  or  refinance  additional  separate  redevelopment  activities  in  two  of  the  Redevelopment 
Project  Areas,  to  fund  a  deposit  to  reserve  accounts  for  the  Loans  and  parity  obligations  of  each 
Redevelopment Project Area, and to pay costs of issuance related to the Loans and the Bonds including, but 
not limited to the costs of bond insurance for the Bonds.  See “PLAN OF FINANCE” herein.   

Book-Entry System 

The Bonds will be initially delivered in the form of a separate single fully registered Bond for each 
series and maturity of the Bonds.  Upon initial delivery, the ownership of each such Bond will be registered on 
the registration books in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, 
New York (“DTC”).  DTC will act as the depository of the Bonds and all payments due on the Bonds will be 
made to DTC or its nominee, which is obligated in turn to remit such payment to the DTC Participants for 
subsequent  disbursement  to  the  Beneficial  Owners  of  the  Bonds,  as  more  fully  described  herein.  See 
APPENDIX D – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM” attached hereto. 

Security for the Bonds 

The Constitution and statutes of the State provide for the financing of redevelopment projects through 
loans payable from a portion of the property taxes collected from within a project area upon the increase in 
taxable valuation of land, improvements, personal property and public utility property. The taxable valuation 
of a project area last equalized prior to the effective date of the ordinance adopting the redevelopment plan, or 
base roll, is established and, except for any period during which the taxable valuation drops below the base 
year level, the taxing agencies thereafter receive the taxes produced by the levy of the then current tax rate 
upon the base roll (“tax increment”).  With certain exceptions (including statutory tax-sharing requirements), 
taxes  collected  upon  any  increase  in  taxable  valuation  over  the  base  roll  are  allocated  to  a  redevelopment 
agency  and  may  be  pledged  by  a  redevelopment  agency  to  the  repayment  of  any  indebtedness  incurred  in 
financing or refinancing a redevelopment project.  Redevelopment agencies themselves have no authority to 
levy property taxes. 

The Bonds of each Series are separately secured by a pledge of, and charge and lien upon, all of the 
Revenues (as defined in the Indenture relating to such Series of Bonds) and such other moneys and securities 
of the Authority as are pledged thereto under the Indenture relating to such Series of Bonds. The Revenues and 
such  other  moneys  and  securities  pledged  under  each  Indenture  constitute  a  trust  fund  for  the  security  and 
payment of the principal of and interest and premium, if any, on the Bonds of said Series issued thereunder. 
The Revenues are comprised principally of the payments to be made by the Agency with respect to principal of 
and interest on each of the Loans.  

2 

 

 

Pursuant to each Loan Agreement, the Agency is obligated to make payments from the Pledged Tax 
Revenues of each Project Area to the Trustee, and the Trustee is obligated under each Indenture to use those 
payments,  which  comprise  the  major  component  of  the  Revenues,  solely  to  make  principal  and  interest 
payments  on  the  Series  of  the  Bonds  to  which  such  Revenues  have  been  pledged.  Scheduled  payments  of 
principal  and  interest  on  the  Taxable  Bonds  are  structured  to  match  the  combined  scheduled  payments  of 
principal of and interest on the taxable Loans under the Loan Agreements and scheduled payments of principal 
and interest on the Tax Exempt Bonds are structured to match the combined scheduled payments of principal 
of and interest on the tax-exempt Loans to be made to the Agency under the Loan Agreements. Debt service 
payments  on  each  Series  of  the  Bonds  will  be  made  by  the  Authority  using  the  moneys  received  by  the 
Authority as debt service payments from the Agency on the Loans, which payments are separately payable by 
the Agency from the separate Tax Revenues received by the Agency from the Redevelopment Project Areas.  

There  is no  cross-collateralization  between  the  Loan Agreements;  tax  increment  revenues  collected 
from one Redevelopment Project Area will not be available to pay loan payments or debt service due on the 
Loan  Agreements  for  other  Redevelopment  Project  Areas.    A  payment  default  under  one  Loan  Agreement 
could cause a payment default on one or both series of the Bonds to the extent that funds in the applicable 
reserve account is insufficient to pay debt service on that portion of the Bonds.  See “SECURITY FOR THE 
BONDS” herein.   

As further discussed herein, the Agency has certain outstanding indebtedness payable on a parity with  
payments of principal and interest on the Loans under the Mount Hope Loan Agreement, outstanding in the 
aggregate  principal  amount  of  $3,895,000.    Additionally,  each  Loan  Agreement  permits,  under  certain 
circumstances described therein, future bonds, loans and indebtedness to be issued payable on a parity with the 
Loans from such Redevelopment Project Area.  See "SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Parity Debt under the 
Loan Agreements" herein.  Also see “MOUNT HOPE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA – Outstanding 
Indebtedness” and “MOUNT HOPE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA – Estimated Tax Revenues, Debt 
Service and Coverage” herein. 

Each  Redevelopment  Project  Area  is  required  to  make  payments  to  taxing  agencies  as  a  result  of 
statutory  obligations  or  payment  agreements.    The  debt  service  coverage  tables  contained  in  this  Official 
Statement  show  those  payments  being  made  prior  to  payment  of  debt  service  on  the  Loans,  although  as 
discussed  in  "TAX  ALLOCATION  FINANCING  AND  LIMITATIONS  ON  TAX  REVENUES  –  Pass-
Through  Agreements"  and  "–  Statutory  Pass-Through  Payments"  herein,  the  Agency  anticipates  that  all  of 
such  payments  will  be  subordinated  to  the  payment  of  debt  service  on  the  Loans  for  each  of  the 
Redevelopment Project Areas. 

To further secure the payment of principal of and interest on the Taxable Bonds and the Tax-Exempt 
Bonds,  the  Agency  is  required,  upon  delivery  of  the  Taxable  Bonds  and  the  Tax-Exempt  Bonds,  to  fund 
separate  Reserve  Accounts  under  each  of  the  Loan  Agreements,  in  an  aggregate  amount  equal  to 
$1,544,765.00  with  respect  to  the  Southcrest  Loan  Agreement,  $1,204,858.05  with  respect  to  the  Central 
Imperial Loan Agreement and $216,903 with respect to the Mount Hope Loan Agreement (the total amount on 
deposit  in  the  reserve  accounts  under  the  Mount  Hope  Loan  Agreement,  including  deposits  related  to  the 
Mount Hope Unrefunded Bonds, is $620,000).  The Reserve Accounts under each Loan Agreement may also 
secure  future  parity  debt  for  such  Redevelopment  Project  Area.    See  “SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS  – 
Reserve Accounts” and “MOUNT HOPE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA – Outstanding Debt” herein 
and Appendix C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS” attached hereto. 

Limited Obligation 

The Bonds are not a debt of the City of San Diego (the “City”), the Agency, the State of California 
(the “State”), or any of its political subdivisions, and neither the City, the Agency, the State, nor any of its 
political  subdivisions  is  liable  hereon,  nor  in  any  event  shall  the  Bonds  be  payable  out  of  any  funds  or 
properties  other  than  those  of  the  Authority  and  Agency  specified  in  the  Indenture.    The  Bonds  do  not 

3 

 

 

constitute an indebtedness of the Agency or the Authority within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory 
debt limitation or restriction. 

Bond Insurance 

The scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Taxable Bonds and the Tax-Exempt Bonds 
when due will be insured by separate financial guaranty insurance policies (each, the “Policy”) to be issued 
concurrently with the delivery of the Taxable Bonds and the Tax-Exempt Bonds by Radian Asset Assurance 
Inc. (the “Insurer”). See “FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE” herein. 

The Agency 

The  Agency  was  activated  by  the  City  Council  of  the  City  (the  “City  Council”)  on  May  6,  1958, 
pursuant to the Redevelopment Law.  The members of the City Council serve as the Board of the Agency.  In 
August  1980,  the  Agency  designated  Southeastern  Economic  Development  Corporation  (“SEDC”)  as 
operating manager of redevelopment projects in the southeastern area of San Diego, east of Interstate 5 and 
south of State Route 94. The Agency charged SEDC with responsibility for the planning, implementation and 
administration  of  redevelopment  in  areas  which  include,  the  Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project  Area,  the 
Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Project  Area,  the  Mount  Hope  Redevelopment  Project  Area,  the  Gateway 
Center West Redevelopment Project Area and a study area called Dells Imperial. 

SEDC was organized in 1981 by the City as a non-profit corporation with a nine-member Board of 
Directors  appointed  by  the  City  Council.  SEDC  has  a  current  operating  staff  of  15  employees.  See  “THE 
AGENCY” herein. 

Redevelopment Project Areas 

Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project  Area. 

  The  redevelopment  plan  for  the  Southcrest 
Redevelopment Project Area (the “Southcrest Redevelopment Plan”) was adopted on April 14, 1986 and 
consists of approximately 301 acres.  As described in the Southcrest Redevelopment Plan, the principal 
redevelopment goal for this area is to revitalize deteriorating commercial and residential areas, redevelop 
the rescinded Highway 252 corridor, and provide business and employment opportunities for the residents 
of  the  southeastern  community.    See  “SOUTHCREST  REDEVELOPMENT  PROJECT  AREA”  and 
APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF THE FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto. 

Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area.  The redevelopment plan for the Central Imperial 
Redevelopment Project Area (the “Central Imperial Redevelopment Plan”) was adopted on September 14, 
1992, and subsequently amended, and consists of approximately 580 acres.  As described in the Central 
Imperial  Redevelopment  Plan,  the  principal  redevelopment  goal  for  this  area  is  to  improve  and 
rehabilitate property, to provide incentives for development of property and employment opportunities, 
and  to  increase  communication  relating  to  such  redevelopment  activities  among  the  residents.    See 
“CENTRAL IMPERIAL REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA” and APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF 
THE FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto.  

Mount  Hope  Redevelopment  Project  Area.    The  redevelopment  plan  for  the  Mount  Hope 
Redevelopment Project Area (the “Mount Hope Redevelopment Plan” and collectively with the Central 
Imperial Redevelopment Plan and the Southcrest Redevelopment Plan, the “Redevelopment Plans”) was 
adopted  on  November  22,  1982  and  consists  of  approximately  210  acres.    As  described  in  the  Mount 
Hope  Redevelopment  Plan,  the  principal  redevelopment  goal  for  this  area  is  to  revitalize  deteriorating 
commercial and residential areas, redevelop the rescinded Highway 252 corridor, and provide business 
and  employment  opportunities  for  the  residents  of  the  southeastern  community.  See  “MOUNT  HOPE

REDEVELOPMENT  PROJECT  AREA”  and  APPENDIX  A  –  “REPORT  OF  THE  FISCAL 
CONSULTANT” attached hereto. 

Continuing Disclosure 

The  Agency  has  covenanted  for  the  benefit  of  the  owners  of  the  Bonds  to  provide,  so  long  as  the 
Bonds are outstanding, respectively, certain financial information and operating data relating to the Agency 
(the “Annual Report”) by not later than 270 days following the end of the Agency’s Fiscal Year (which is 
currently June 30), commencing with the Annual Report for the 2006-07 Fiscal Year and to provide notices of 
the occurrences of certain enumerated events, if material.  These covenants have been made in order to assist 
the  Underwriters  in  complying  with  Rule  15c2-12(b)(5)  adopted  by  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as the same may be amended from time to time (the 
“Rule”).  The specific nature of the information to be contained in the Annual Report or the notices of material 
events by the Agency is set forth in the Continuing Disclosure Certificate for the Bonds.  As described under 
“– Certain Investigations Regarding the City” below, the Agency filed Annual Reports filed with respect to 
Fiscal Years 2002-03 through 2004-05 for certain outstanding obligations of the Agency, but did not provide 
financial statements with such Annual Reports because the City’s financial statements were not available.  See 
“CONTINUING  DISCLOSURE”  herein  and  APPENDIX F  –  “FORM  OF  CONTINUING  DISCLOSURE 
CERTIFICATE” attached hereto. 

Certain Investigations Regarding the City 

The following provides a summary of certain matters  regarding the City’s financial statements  and 
certain ongoing investigations relating to the City.  The City found errors in various financial statements for 
the  fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2002.    Certain  of  these  errors  were  reported  by  the  City  to  the  nationally 
recognized  municipal  securities  information  repositories  in  filings  dated  January  27,  2004,  and  March  12, 
2004.  As  a  result  of  the  discovery  of  such  errors,  the  City  retained  the  accounting  firm  of  KPMG  LLP 
(“KPMG”) to perform a full scope audit and render an opinion on the financial statements of the City for the 
fiscal year ended June 30, 2003.  The City has retained the accounting firm of Macias Gini & O'Connell LLP 
(“Macias”) to perform an audit and render an opinion on the financial statements of the City for the fiscal year 
ended  June  30,  2004  and  June  30,  2005  and  is  negotiating  with  such  firm  for  auditing  fiscal  years  ended 
June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2007.   

On February 13, 2004, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) notified the 
City  that  it  was  investigating  certain  City  bond  offerings.    At  the  same  time,  the  United  States  Attorney’s 
Office began its investigation regarding certain bond offerings by the City.  The City retained Vinson & Elkins 
L.L.P. (“V&E”) to investigate the City’s disclosure practices regarding the funding of its pension fund liability 
for the period 1996-2004.  V&E released their initial report on September 16, 2004.  KPMG advised the City 
that  in  its  view  the  V&E  report  did  not  provide  a  basis  for  the  City  to  conclude  whether  there  was  any 
“intentional misconduct or other conduct, which violated any law, rule, or regulation having the force of law.” 
On  August  4,  2005  V&E  released  an  additional  report  intended  to  complete  the  additional  investigative 
procedures to be responsive to KPMG’s concerns.  Such report was submitted for review to the City Council 
and to Kroll Inc., serving at the time as the City's outside Audit Committee (the “Kroll Audit Committee”). 

On August 8, 2006, the Kroll Audit Committee released its report entitled, “Investigation Into The San 
Diego City’s Employees’ Retirement System and the City of San Diego Sewer Rate Structure” (the “Report”).  
The Report concluded that failures of the City government, including government officials, contributed to the 
City’s failure to conform to requirements of law and to adhere to principles of sound governance and financial 
reporting.  Moreover, the Report concluded that City officials deliberately failed to obey the law with regard to 
rate setting requirements for the sewer system. 

On November 14, 2006, the City entered into a cease-and-desist order with the Commission relating to 
violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in 

5 

 

 

connection with the offer and sale of municipal securities in 2002 and 2003, and other related public financial 
disclosures.   

The Commission concluded that the “City’s public disclosures in the preliminary official statements 
and official statements for its 2002 and 2003 offerings, its 2003 continuing disclosures, and presentations to 
the rating agencies failed to disclose material information regarding the City’s current funding of its pension 
and retiree health care obligations, the City’s future pension and retiree health care obligations, and the City’s 
ability  to  pay  those  future  obligations.”    The  Commission  further  concluded  that  “[t]he  City,  through  its 
officials, acted with scienter.” 

The  cease-and-desist  order  also  imposed  certain  remedial  sanctions,  including  the  retention  of  an 
independent consultant to review and assess its policies, procedures and internal controls with respect to bond 
offerings, including disclosures made in its financial statements.  On January 16, 2007, the City retained the 
law  firm  of  Edwards  Angell  Palmer  &  Dodge,  LLP  to  serve  as  Independent  Consultant.    The  independent 
consultant is required to conduct annual reviews of the City’s policies, procedures and internal controls for a 
three year period, and provide copies of such annual reports to the Commission.  On June 7, 2007 the Initial 
Report of Independent Consultant to the City of San Diego was released. 

The Commission’s investigation is ongoing as to individuals and other entities that may have violated 
federal security laws.  The City Attorney has prepared several reports regarding the City’s underfunding of its 
pension system in which he concluded that various City officials violated provisions of federal securities laws 
and other State law.  All of those reports are available on the City Attorney’s website. 

On March 16, 2007 KPMG released an unqualified opinion regarding the City's financial statements 
for  the  fiscal  year  ending  June  30,  2003.    The  2003  financial  statements  were  referred  to  the  City's  Audit 
Committee, which consists of three members of the City Council.  The Audit Committee completed its review 
of the 2003 financial statements on May 21, 2007, and on June 5, 2007 the City Council received and filed the 
City's  Fiscal  Year  2003  Comprehensive  Annual  Financial  Report  (CAFR).    On  June  8,  2007  the  Agency’s  
stand alone Annual Financial Report for Fiscal Year 2003 was released.  Since the Agency is a component unit 
of the City, the release of its stand alone financial statements was delayed pending the release of the City’s 
financial statements.   

On  June  11,  2007,  Macias  released  an  unqualified  opinion  on  the  City's  Financial  Statements  for 
Fiscal Year 2004.  Such financial statements have been referred to the Audit Committee for review.  The City's 
financial statements for the fiscal years ending 2005 and 2006 have not been completed.  The Agency has not 
yet completed its stand alone financial reports for fiscal years 2004 through 2006.  At this time, it cannot be 
determined when Macias will provide opinion letters regarding the City's, including the Agency's, outstanding 
financial statements.   

The Bonds are not payable from any funds of the City, including amounts in the City’s General Fund, 
and Tax Revenues are not impacted by the financial condition of the City's General Fund. See “SECURITY 
FOR THE BONDS – Limited Obligation” herein.  However, Tax Revenues are initially invested in the City’s 
Investment Pool before they are transferred to the Trustee for deposit in accordance with the Indentures and 
Loan  Agreements,  as  applicable.  See  “RISK  FACTORS  –  Investment  of  Tax  Revenues”  and  “–  Certain 
Bankruptcy  Risks”  herein.    To  the  best  knowledge  of  the  Agency,  the  investigations  relating  to  the  City’s 
financial statements and disclosure practices do not involve matters directly related to the security for, or the 
payment of, the Bonds. 

Forward–Looking Statements 

Certain  statements  included  or  incorporated  by  reference  in  this  Official  Statement,  including  the 
appendices hereto, constitute “forward–looking statements” within the meaning of the United States Private 
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 21E of the United States Securities and Exchange Act of 

6 

 

 

1934,  as  amended.  Such  statements  are  generally  identifiable  by  the  terminology  used  such  as  “plan,” 
“expect,” “estimate,” “budget” or other similar words. The achievement of certain results or other expectations 
contained  in  such  forward–looking  statements  involve  known  and  unknown  risks,  uncertainties  and  other 
factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements described to be materially different from 
any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward–looking statements. No 
assurance is given that actual results will meet the Agency’s forecasts in any way.  Except as set forth in the 
disclosure undertakings, the Agency does not plan to issue any updates or revisions to those forward–looking 
statements if or when its expectations, or events, conditions or circumstances on which such statements are 
based occur or do not occur. 

Additional Information 

The  information  and  expressions  of  opinion  herein  speak  only  as  of  their  date  and  are  subject  to 
change without notice.  Neither the delivery of this Official Statement nor any sale made hereunder nor any 
future use of this Official Statement will, under any circumstances, create any implication that there has been

Copies of the Indentures and the Loan Agreements are available upon request and payment of costs to 
the  Agency  at  Southeastern  Economic  Development  Corporation,  4393  Imperial  Avenue,  Suite  200,  San 
Diego, California 92113, Attention: Director of Finance, (619) 527-7345. 

THE AUTHORITY 

The San Diego Public Facilities Financing Authority is a public agency duly organized and existing 
pursuant to a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (the “Agreement”) between the City and the Agency. The 
Agreement was entered into pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1, 2 and 4, Chapter 5, Division 7, Title 1 of 
the Government Code of the State of California.  The Board of Commissioners of the Authority are appointed 
by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council and the Agency. The Authority was created for the primary 
purpose of financing certain public capital facilities improvements of the City and the Agency. No assets or 
property  of  the  Authority,  other  than  amounts  pledged  under  the  Taxable  Indenture  and  the  Tax-Exempt 
Indenture, as applicable, secure the payment of debt service on the Bonds.  

THE AGENCY 

The  Agency  was  activated  on  May  6,  1958,  by  action  of  the  City  Council,  pursuant  to  the 
Redevelopment Law. The Agency is a separate legal entity from the City. The members of the City Council 
serve as the Agency Board.   

On  November  2,  2004,  City  voters  passed  Proposition  F,  which  amended  the  City  Charter  to  add 
Article XV to "test implementation of a new form of governance commonly known as a Strong Mayor form of 
government" for a five-year period.  Under this form of government the Mayor is the Chief Executive Officer 
of the City, and the City Council is now composed of eight members, presided over by a Council President.  
On  January  1,  2006,  the  Mayor  assumed  all  executive  power  and  responsibilities  conferred  upon  the  City 
Manager  under  City  Charter  Articles  V  –  Executive  and  Administrative  Services,  VII  –  Finance,  and  IX  – 
Retirement of Employees.   

7 

 

 

The Mayor is currently serving as the Executive Director of the Agency, although Proposition F does 
not  specifically  require  that  the  Mayor  serve  in  this  position.    James  T.  Waring  is  the  Assistant  Executive 
Director and Janice Weinrick is the Deputy Executive Director. 

The Agency is charged with the responsibility of eliminating blight within the redevelopment project 
areas through the process of redevelopment.  The Agency exercises governmental functions in carrying out 
projects,  and  has  sufficiently  broad  authority  to  acquire,  develop,  administer  and  sell  or  lease  property, 
including the right of eminent domain and the right to issue bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness 
and to expend their proceeds.  

In addition, the Agency can clear buildings and other improvements and develop as a building site any 
real  property  owned  or  acquired,  and  in  connection  with  such  development,  cause  streets,  highways  and 
sidewalks to be constructed or reconstructed and public utilities to be installed. The Agency may, out of the 
funds  available  to  it  for  such  purposes,  pay  for  all  or  part  of  the  value  of  land  and  the  cost  of  buildings, 
facilities, structures or other improvements to be publicly owned, to the extent that such improvements are of 
benefit to the relevant project area and no other reasonable means of financing is available.  The Agency must 
sell  or  lease  remaining  property  within  a  project  for  redevelopment  by  others  in  strict  conformity  with  the 
redevelopment plan, and may specify a period within which such redevelopment must begin and be completed.

THE BONDS 

The Bonds will be dated as of their delivery date, will mature on October 1 in each of the years and in 
the  amounts,  and  will  bear  interest  (calculated  on  the  basis  of  a  360-day  year  comprised  of  twelve  30-day 
months) at the rates as shown on the inside cover page of this Official Statement. The Bonds will be issued in 
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple in excess thereof.  Interest on the Bonds will be payable on 
April 1 and October 1 of each year (each an “Interest Payment Date”), commencing October 1, 2007, unless 
(a) it is authenticated after a Record Date and on or before the following Interest Payment Date, in which event 
it  shall  bear  interest  from  such  Interest  Payment  Date,  or  (b)  it  is  authenticated  on  or  before 
September 15, 2007, in which event is will bear interest from the Closing Date.

securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee).  One fully registered certificate 
will  be  issued  for  each  series  and  maturity  of  the  Bonds  in  denominations  equal  to  the  aggregate  principal 
amount of the Bonds maturing in that year, and will be deposited with DTC.  All payments due on the Bonds 
will be made to DTC or its nominee, which is obligated in turn to remit such payment to the DTC Participants 
for subsequent disbursement to the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds, as more fully described herein. So long as 
Cede & Co. is the registered owner of the Bonds, as nominee of DTC, references herein to the owners of the 
Bonds  or  Bondowners  shall  mean  Cede &  Co.  and  shall  not  mean  the  actual  purchasers  of  the  Bonds  (the

Notice of Redemption.  The Trustee on behalf and at the expense of the Authority shall mail (by first-
class mail) notice of any redemption to the respective Owners of any Bonds designated for redemption at their 
respective  addresses  appearing  on  the  Registration  Books,  and  to  the  Securities  Depositories  and  to  one  or 
more Information Services, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption; 
provided, however, that neither failure to receive any such notice so mailed nor any defect therein shall affect 
the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of such Bonds or the cessation of the accrual of interest 
thereon.    Such  notice  shall  state  the  date  of  the  notice,  the  redemption  date,  the  redemption  place  and  the 
redemption price and shall designate the CUSIP numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed, state the individual 
number of each Bond to be redeemed or state that all Taxable Bonds or Tax-Exempt Bonds between two stated 
numbers (both inclusive) or all of the Taxable Bonds or Tax-Exempt Bonds Outstanding (or all Taxable Bonds 
or Tax-Exempt Bonds of a maturity) are to be redeemed, and shall require that such Bonds be then surrendered 
at the Trust Office of the Trustee for redemption at the redemption price, giving notice also that further interest 
on such Bonds will not accrue from and after the redemption date.   

The Authority shall have the right to rescind any optional redemption by written notice to the Trustee 
on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. Any notice of optional redemption shall be cancelled and annulled 
if for any reason funds are not available on the date fixed for redemption for the payment in full of the Bonds 
then  called  for  redemption,  and  such  cancellation  shall  not  constitute  an  Event  of  Default  hereunder.    The 
Trustee shall mail notice of rescission of redemption in the same manner notice of redemption was originally 
provided. 

Effect  of  Redemption.    From  and  after  the  date  fixed  for  redemption,  if  funds  available  for  the 
payment of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on the Bonds so called for redemption shall have 
been duly provided, such Bonds so called shall cease to be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture other 
than the right to receive payment of the redemption price, and no interest shall accrue thereon from and after 
the redemption date specified in such notice. 

Partial Optional Redemption or Purchase.  If less than all of the Term Bonds of a particular maturity 
have been redeemed or purchased and tendered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to the Indenture (other 
than  in  connection  with  making  a  particular  sinking  fund  payment),  the  total  amount  of  all  sinking  fund 
redemptions shall be reduced by the aggregate principal amount of such Term Bonds so redeemed or tendered 
and cancelled, to be allocated among such sinking fund payments as shall be designated by the Authority in 
writing, or, if not so designated, pro rata among such sinking fund payments.

PLAN OF FINANCE 

Amounts deposited in the Redevelopment Fund for a Redevelopment Project Area will be used by the 
Agency to finance redevelopment activities in each such Redevelopment Project Area.  Amounts deposited in 
the  Housing  Trust  Fund  for  a  Redevelopment  Project  Area  will  be  used  by  the  Agency  to  finance  certain 
improvements  relating  to,  or  increasing  the  supply  of,  low  and  moderate  income  housing  in  such 
Redevelopment  Project  Area  and  such  other  areas  as  authorized  by  the  Redevelopment  Law.    See 
“ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS” herein. 

A portion of the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds will be used to refund the Agency’s Southcrest 
Redevelopment  Project  Tax  Allocation  Bonds,  Series  1995  (the  “Southcrest  1995  Refunded  Bonds”).    The 
Southcrest 1995 Refunded Bonds will be refunded pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the “Southcrest 1995 
Escrow  Agreement”),  dated  as  of  July  12,  2007,  between  the  Agency  and  The  Bank  of  New  York  Trust 
Company, N.A., as escrow holder (the “Escrow Agent”).  A portion of the proceeds of the Bonds, together 
with certain other available moneys, will be held in an escrow fund by the Escrow Agent (the “Southcrest 1995 
Escrow Fund”) for the benefit of the owners of the Southcrest 1995 Refunded Bonds.  The amounts deposited 
in the Southcrest 1995 Escrow Fund will be held uninvested or used to purchase certain direct obligations of 
the United States of America (the “Government Obligations”) which will be sufficient, together with interest 
earnings thereon, to redeem the Southcrest 1995 Refunded Bonds on August 13, 2007, at a redemption price 
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof.  The securities and other moneys held under the Southcrest 
1995  Escrow  Agreement  will  be  pledged  to  payment  of  the  Southcrest  1995  Refunded  Bonds.  Neither  the 
principal of the securities held in the Southcrest 1995 Escrow Fund nor the interest thereon will be available 
for payments with respect to the Bonds.   

A portion of the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds will be used to refund the Agency’s Southcrest 
Redevelopment  Project  Tax  Allocation  Bonds,  Series  2000  (the  “Southcrest  2000  Refunded  Bonds”).    The 
Southcrest 2000 Refunded Bonds will be refunded pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the “Southcrest 2000 
Escrow Agreement”), dated as of July 12, 2007, between the Agency and the Escrow Agent.  A portion of the 
proceeds of the Bonds, together with certain other available moneys, will be held in an escrow fund by the 
Escrow  Agent  (the  “Southcrest  2000  Escrow  Fund”)  for  the  benefit  of  the  owners  of  the  Southcrest  2000 
Refunded  Bonds.    The  amounts  deposited  in  the  Southcrest  2000  Escrow  Fund  will  be  used  to  purchase 
Government Obligations which will be sufficient, together with interest earnings thereon, to pay debt service 
on the Southcrest 2000 Refunded Bonds through and including their date of prepayment on October 1, 2010 
and on such date to pay the redemption price of the Southcrest 2000 Refunded Bonds, equal to 101% of the 
principal amount thereof.  The securities and other moneys held under the Southcrest 2000 Escrow Agreement 
will be pledged to payment of the Southcrest 2000 Refunded Bonds. Neither the principal of the securities held 
in the Southcrest 2000 Escrow Fund nor the interest thereon will be available for payments with respect to the 
Bonds.   

A  portion  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Tax-Exempt  Bonds  will  be  used  to  refund  the  Agency’s  Central 
Imperial Redevelopment Project Tax Allocation Bonds, Series 2000 (the “Central Imperial Refunded Bonds”).  
The  Central  Imperial  Refunded  Bonds  will  be  refunded  pursuant  to  the  Escrow  Agreement  (the  “Central 
Imperial  Escrow  Agreement”),  dated  as  of  July  12,  2007,  between  the  Agency  and  the  Escrow  Agent.    A 
portion of the proceeds of the Bonds, together with certain other available moneys, will be held in an escrow 
fund by the Escrow Agent (the “Central Imperial Escrow Fund”) for the benefit of the owners of the Central 
Imperial  Refunded  Bonds.    The  amounts  deposited  in  the  Central  Imperial  Escrow  Fund  will  be  used  to 
purchase Government Obligations which will be sufficient, together with interest earnings thereon, to pay debt 
service on the Central Imperial Refunded Bonds through and including their date of prepayment on October 1, 
2010 and on such date to pay the redemption price of the Central Imperial Refunded Bonds, equal to 101% of 
the  principal  amount  thereof.    The  securities  and  other  moneys  held  under  the  Central  Imperial  Escrow 
Agreement will be pledged to payment of the Central Imperial Refunded Bonds. Neither the principal of the 
securities held in the Central Imperial Escrow Fund nor the interest thereon will be available for payments with 
respect to the Bonds.

A  portion  of the proceeds of  the  Taxable  Bonds  will be used  to  refund the  Agency’s  Mount  Hope 
Redevelopment  Project  Tax  Allocation  Bonds,  Series  1995B  (the  “Mount  Hope  Refunded  Bonds”).    The 
Mount Hope Refunded Bonds will be refunded pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the “Mount Hope Escrow 
Agreement”), dated as of July 12, 2007, between the Agency and the Escrow Agent.  A portion of the proceeds 
of  the  Bonds,  together  with  certain  other  available  moneys,  will  be  held  in  an  escrow  fund  by  the  Escrow 
Agent (the “Mount Hope Escrow Fund”) for the benefit of the owners of the Mount Hope Refunded Bonds.  
The  amounts  deposited  in  the  Mount  Hope  Escrow  Fund  will  be  held  uninvested  or  used  to  purchase 
Government Obligations which will be sufficient, together with interest earnings thereon, to redeem the Mount 
Hope  Refunded  Bonds  on  August 13,  2007,  at  a  redemption  price  equal  to  101%  of  the  principal  amount 
thereof.  The securities and other moneys held under the Mount Hope Escrow Agreement will be pledged to 
payment of the Mount Hope Refunded Bonds. Neither the principal of the securities held in the Mount Hope 
Escrow Fund nor the interest thereon will be available for payments with respect to the Bonds.

General 

SECURITY FOR THE BONDS 

Under  provisions  of  the  California  Constitution  and  the  Redevelopment  Law,  taxes  levied  upon 
taxable property in the Project Areas each year by or for the benefit of the State of California, any city, county, 
city and county or other public corporation (“taxing agencies”) for Fiscal Years beginning, after the effective 
date of the ordinance approving the redevelopment plan for each Redevelopment Project Area (the “Effective 
Date”), are divided as follows: 

1.  The portion equal to the amount of those taxes which would have been produced by the current 
tax  rate,  applied  to  the  assessed  value  of  the  taxable  property  in  each  Redevelopment  Project  Area  as  last 
equalized prior to the Effective Date is paid (when collected) into the funds of those respective taxing agencies 
as taxes by or for such taxing agencies; 

2.  Except  as  provided  in  subparagraph  (3)  below,  that  portion  of  such  levied  taxes  each  year  in 
excess of such amount is allocated to and when collected paid into a special fund of the Agency, to the extent 
required to pay the principal of and interest on loans, moneys advanced to, or indebtedness (whether funded, 
refunded, assumed or otherwise) incurred by the Agency to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, (i) the 
Agency’s redevelopment projects within the Redevelopment Project Area and (ii) under certain circumstances, 
publicly owned improvements outside of the Redevelopment Project Area; and 

3.  That portion of the taxes identified in subparagraph (2) above that are attributable to a tax rate 
levied  by  a  taxing  agency  for  the  purpose  of  producing  revenues  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  make  annual 
repayments of principal of, and the interest on, any bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of 

18 

 

 

real property approved by the voters of the taxing agency on or after January 1, 1989, shall be allocated to, and 
when collected shall be paid into, the fund of such taxing agency. 

The Redevelopment Law requires that, except under certain circumstances, redevelopment agencies 
set aside 20% of all gross tax increment derived from redevelopment project areas into a low and moderate 
income  housing  fund, to be  used  for  the  purpose  of  increasing,  improving  and  preserving  the community’s 
supply  of  low  and  moderate  income  housing.  Such  20%  set–aside  requirement  is  referred  herein  as  the 
“Housing Set–Aside Amounts.” 

Pledge under the Indenture 

The Bonds are secured by a first lien and pledge on all of the Revenues and a pledge of all moneys in 

the Interest Account and Principal Account held under the related Indenture.   

Under  the  Indentures,  “Revenues”  means  (a)  all  amounts  payable  by  the  Agency  to  the  Authority 
pursuant  to  the  Loan  Agreements  for,  with  respect  to  the  Taxable  Indenture,  the  Taxable  Bonds,  or  with 
respect to the Tax-Exempt Indenture, the Tax-Exempt Bonds, other than administrative fees and expenses and 
indemnity against claims payable to the Authority and the Trustee; (b) any proceeds of, with respect to the 
Taxable Indenture, the Taxable Bonds, or with respect to the Tax-Exempt Indenture, the Tax-Exempt Bonds, 
originally deposited with the Trustee and all moneys deposited and held from time to time by the Trustee in the 
funds and accounts established under such Indenture; and (c) investment income with respect to any moneys 
held by the Trustee in the funds and accounts established under such Indenture. 

Pledge under the Loan Agreements 

The Loan Agreements have similar terms.  Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a Loan Agreement is 
secured by a first lien on and pledge of Tax Revenues of the related Redevelopment Project Area.  The Agency 
covenants  in  the  Loan  Agreements  that,  except  as  set  forth  thereunder,  it  will not  grant  any  prior  or  parity 
pledge  of  related  Tax  Revenues  or  create  or  permit  to  be  created  any  charge  or  lien  on  the  related  Tax 
Revenues  ranking  prior  to  the  indebtedness  incurred  pursuant  to  such  Loan  Agreement.    Under  each  Loan 
Agreement, the payments due under such Loan Agreement are payable from Pledged Tax Revenues relating to 
the Redevelopment Project Area associated with such Loan Agreement. 

“Pledged Tax Revenues” with respect to a Loan means, for each Bond Year, (i) the first Project Tax 
Revenues in an amount that is equal to eighty percent (80%) of Annual Debt Service for the related Loan for 
such Bond Year, plus an amount, if any, equal to the amount required to maintain the Project Reserve Fund  at 
the  Reserve  Requirement  (including  any  sums  required  to  be  repaid  for  amounts  drawn  under  any  Reserve 
Fund  Surety  Bond  for  such  Bonds)  and  (ii)  the  first  Housing  Tax  Revenues  in  an  amount  equal  to  twenty 
percent (20%) of Annual Debt Service for the related Loan for such Bond Year, plus an amount, if any, equal 
to the amount required to maintain the Housing Reserve Fund at the Reserve Requirement (including any sums 
required  to  be  repaid  for  amounts  drawn  under  any  Reserve  Fund  Surety  Bond  for  such  Bonds);  provided, 
however,  that  in  each  Bond  Year,  Pledged  Tax  Revenues  shall  also  include  such  amount  of  Project  Tax 
Revenues and/or Housing Tax Revenues, if any, which is necessary to pay all prior Annual Debt Service which 
has accrued but remain unpaid and unprovided for. 

“Project  Tax  Revenues”  means  the  eighty  percent  (80%)  of  Tax  Revenues  for  the  related 

Redevelopment Project Area other than Housing Tax Revenues. 

“Housing  Tax  Revenues”  means  the  twenty  percent  (20%)  of  Tax  Revenues  for  the  related 
Redevelopment Project Area which are currently required to be deposited in the Low and Moderate Income 
Housing Fund pursuant to Sections 33334.2, 33334.3, 33334.6 and 33487 of the Redevelopment Law. 

19 

 

 

“Tax  Revenues”  means  that  portion  of  taxes  levied  (including  all  payments,  reimbursements  and 
subventions paid by the State, if any, specifically attributable to ad valorem taxes lost by reason of business 
inventory  tax  or  other  exemptions  and  tax  rate  limitations)  upon  taxable  property  in  each  respective 
Redevelopment  Project  Area  which  is  allocated  to  and  paid  into  a  special  fund  of  the  Agency  pursuant  to 
Article 6 of Chapter 6 of the Redevelopment Law, Section 16 of Article XVI of the Constitution of the State of 
California and the Redevelopment Plan, subject to the Tax Increment Limitation but excluding payments, if 
any, made to the County of San Diego as an administrative fee pursuant to SB 2557 and excluding moneys 
reserved to taxing entities under Health and Safety Code Sections 33676, 33607.5 and 33607.7 (or under other 
provisions  of  Redevelopment  Law)  to  the  extent  that  such  payments  are  not  lawfully  subordinate  to  the 
payment of Annual Debt Service under the Loan Agreements. 

“Tax  Increment  Limitation”  means  the  limitation  of  $87,000,000,  $142,000,000,  and  $47,000,000 
which  is  the  maximum  amount  of  Tax  Revenues  which  may  be  paid  to  the  Agency  from  the  Southcrest 
Redevelopment Project Area, Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area, and Mount Hope Redevelopment 
Project  Area,  respectively,  as  such  limitation  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time  pursuant  to  the 
Redevelopment Law, and excluding from the calculation of such limit the amounts permitted to be excluded by 
the Redevelopment Law. 

There  is no  cross-collateralization  between  the  Loan Agreements;  tax  increment  revenues  collected 
from one Redevelopment Project Area will not be available to pay loan payments or debt service due on the 
Loan  Agreements  for  other  Redevelopment  Project  Areas.    A  payment  default  under  one  Loan  Agreement 
could cause a payment default on one or both series of the Bonds to the extent that funds in the applicable 
reserve account and other reserve accounts related to parity indebtedness (if any) are insufficient to pay debt 
service on that portion of the Bonds.  The table below indicated the principal amount of the Loan for each 
Redevelopment Project Area.  Each Redevelopment Project Area’s share of the debt service on the Bonds will 
vary from year to year.  See “DEBT SERVICE SCHEDULE” herein.

On  the  date  of  issuance  of  the  Bonds,  the  total  deposit  in  reserve  accounts  related  to  indebtedness 
secured by Tax Revenues related to the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area is $620,000 (includes cash 
already on deposit in the amount of $97,597, a surety bond in the amount of $305,500 and $216,903 deposited 
under the Mount Hope Loan Agreement as indicated in the table above).  This amount secures the payments 

20 

 

 

due under the Mount Hope Loan Agreement, the Unrefunded Mount Hope Bonds, and any future parity debt 
incurred in accordance with the Mount Hope Loan Agreement. 

At least annually, prior to October 1, the Trustee is required to determine the value of the Reserve 
Fund under each Loan Agreement.  Permitted Investments shall be valued at cost.  A Reserve Fund Insurance 
Policy deposited with the Trustee is required to be valued as equal to the face amount or stated amount of such 
policy.  If, on any valuation of the Reserve Fund, the value of the Reserve Fund shall exceed the Reserve Fund 
Requirement, unless otherwise provided in a Supplemental Trust Agreement, such excess shall be withdrawn 
and transferred to the Agency to be used for any lawful purpose.  If, on valuation of the Reserve Fund, the 
value is less than the Reserve Fund Requirement, deposits shall be made into the Reserve Fund from and to the 
extent of Tax Revenues as provided in the Loan Agreement until the Reserve Fund Requirement is restored.  A 
“Reserve Fund Insurance Policy” is an insurance policy provided by a bond insurer, a letter of credit, surety 
bond or other credit instrument, deposited in the Reserve Fund in lieu of or partial substitution for cash or 
securities on deposit therein, provided, however, that the obligations of the entity providing such Reserve Fund 
Insurance Policy shall be continuously rated in one of the two highest classifications by Moody’s and S&P, the 
Reserve Fund Insurance Policy shall be acceptable to the Insurer, and S&P shall receive prior notification of 
the deposit of such Reserve Fund Insurance Policy. 

Parity Debt under the Loan Agreements 

Southcrest  Loan  Agreement.    As  condition  to  the  issuance  of  any  Bond  or  other  indebtedness

excluding any subvention payments made by the State) will be at least equal to 125% of Maximum Annual 
Debt Service for all Housing Parity Bonds which will be Outstanding immediately after the issuance of the

meeting the criteria described in the prior paragraph unless all then Outstanding Senior Obligations are covered 
by one or more Municipal Bond Insurance Policies and the Agency first obtains the prior written consent of all 
Insurers of the Outstanding Senior Obligations.

Limited Obligation 

The Bonds are not a debt of the City, the Agency, the State, or any of its political subdivisions, and 
neither the City, said Agency, the State, nor any of its political subdivisions is liable hereon, nor in any event 
shall  the  Bonds  be  payable  out  of  any  funds  or  properties  other  than  those  of  the  Authority  and  Agency 
specified  in  the  Indentures.    The  Bonds  do  not  constitute  an  indebtedness  of  the  Agency  or  the  Authority 
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction. 

Investments 

The proceeds of the Bonds and other moneys required to be deposited by the Agency in the funds and 
accounts established under the Indentures and the Loan Agreements will be held and invested in Permitted

FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE 

The following information has been supplied by Radian Asset Assurance Inc.  for inclusion in this 
Official  Statement.  No  representation  is  made  by  the  Agency  or  the  Underwriters  as  to  the  accuracy  or 
completeness of the information.  See APPENDIX G – “FORM OF FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE 
POLICY” attached hereto. 

Description Of Financial Guaranty Insurance Policy 

A financial guaranty insurance policy for the Taxable Bonds and a financial guaranty insurance policy 
for the Tax-Exempt Bonds (each, the "Policy") will be issued by Radian Asset Assurance Inc. (the "Insurer") 
simultaneously with the issuance and delivery of the Taxable Bonds and the Tax Exempt-Bonds, respectively.  
The Policy is noncancelable during its term and provides for the prompt payment of principal of and interest 
on  the  related  Bonds  to  the  extent  that  Trustee,  has  not  received  sufficient  funds  from  the  Authority  for 
payment of the related Bonds on the "due date."  The Insurer is obligated to make the required payment on the 
later of the due date or the first business day after which the Insurer has received notice from The Bank of New 
York, as Insurance Trustee (the "Insurance Trustee"), that the Authority has failed to pay amounts due on the 
related  Bonds.    Under  the  Policy,  the  "due  date"  of  the  related  Bonds,  when  referring  to  the  payment  of 
principal, means the stated maturity date thereof or the date on which payment of principal is due by reason of 

23 

 

 

mandatory sinking fund payments and does not mean any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of 
any  call  for  redemption,  acceleration,  or  other  advancement  of  maturity,  other  than  in  the  discretion  of  the 
Insurer.  With respect to interest on the related Bonds, the "due date" means the stated date for payment of 
interest.  The Policy guarantees reimbursement of any recovery of any such payment from a Holder or the 
Trustee  pursuant  to  a  final  judgment  by  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  holding  that  such  payment 
constituted a voidable preference within the meaning of any applicable bankruptcy law. 

For specific information on the coverage provided, reference should be made to the Policy that has 
been reproduced in specimen form in Appendix G hereto.  The Policy does not insure against nonpayment of 
principal or interest on the related Bonds due to the insolvency, misconduct or negligence of the Trustee.  The 
Policy does not insure the payment of any redemption premium.

The Insurer is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Radian, a publicly owned corporation with its 
shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol “RDN”).  Radian is a global credit risk management 
company headquartered in Philadelphia with significant operations in both New York and London.  Radian 
develops  innovative  financial  solutions  by  applying  its  core  mortgage  credit  risk  expertise  and  structured 
finance capabilities to the credit enhancement needs of the capital markets worldwide, primarily through credit 
insurance products. The company also provides credit enhancement for public finance and other corporate and 
consumer assets on both a direct and reinsurance basis and holds strategic interests in credit-based consumer 
asset  businesses.    NONE  OF  RADIAN,  RADIAN’S  OTHER  SUBSIDIARIES  OR  ANY  OF  RADIAN’S 
INVESTORS IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE DEBTS OF OR CLAIMS AGAINST THE INSURER. 

On June 29, 2006, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, 
Inc.  (“S&P”)  affirmed  the  Insurer’s  “AA”  financial  strength  rating  and  revised  upward  its  outlook  on  the 
Insurer  from  “negative”  to  “stable.”    The  Insurer  also  has  an  insurance  financial  strength  rating  of  “Aa3” 
(outlook: stable) from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and a claims paying ability rating of “AA” 
(outlook: negative) from Fitch Ratings Services (“Fitch”).  The ratings of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch reflect only 
the views of the applicable rating agency, respectively, do not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold 
securities  and  are  subject  to  revision  or  withdrawal  at  any  time  by  such  rating  agencies.    Any  further 
explanation of any rating may be obtained only from the applicable rating agency.  Any downward revision or 
withdrawal of any of the above ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds.  The 
Insurer does not guarantee the market price or investment value of the Bonds nor does it guarantee that the 
ratings on the Bonds will not be revised or withdrawn. 

The Insurer is licensed and subject to regulation as a financial guaranty insurance corporation under 
the laws of the State of New York, its state of domicile. In addition, Radian and its insurance subsidiaries are 
subject  to  regulation  by  insurance  laws  of  the  various  other  jurisdictions  in  which  they  are  licensed  to  do 
business. As a financial guaranty insurance corporation licensed to do business in the State of New York, the 
Insurer is subject to Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law which, among other things, limits the business 
of each financial guaranty insurer to financial guaranty insurance and related business lines, requires that each 
financial  guaranty  insurer  maintain  a  minimum  surplus  to  policyholders,  establishes  contingency,  loss  and 
unearned premium reserve requirements for each financial guaranty insurer, and limits the size of individual 
transactions and the volume of transactions that may be underwritten by each financial guaranty insurer.  Other 
provisions of the New York Insurance Law, applicable to non-life insurance companies such as the Insurer 
regulate,  among  other  things,  permitted  investments,  payment  of  dividends,  transactions  with  affiliates, 
mergers, consolidations, acquisitions or sales of assets and incurrence of liability for borrowings.

Neither the Insurer nor any of its affiliates accepts any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness 
of, nor have they participated in the preparation of, this Official Statement or any information or disclosure that 
is provided to potential purchasers of the Bonds, or omitted from such disclosure, other than with respect to the 
accuracy of information presented under the heading FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE" and as set 
forth in Appendix G of this Official Statement. The Insurer's role is limited to providing the coverage set forth 
in  the  Policy.    In  addition,  the  Insurer  makes  no  representation  regarding  the  Bonds  or  the  advisability  of 
purchasing the Bonds. 

On February 6, 2007, Radian and MGIC Investment Corporation (NYSE: MTG) (“MGIC”) entered 
into  an  Agreement  and  Plan  of  Merger,  pursuant  to  which  Radian  has  agreed,  subject  to  the  terms  and 
conditions of the merger agreement, to merge with and into MGIC, with the combined company to be renamed 
MGIC Radian Financial Group Inc.  Additional information regarding this merger may be found in a Current 
Report on Form 8-K of Radian filed on February 6, 2007 and the attachments thereto.  The merger has been 
approved by each company’s board of directors and shareholders and is currently expected to be completed 
late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2007, subject to various regulatory approvals. 

Upon completion of the merger, certain of the Insurer’s reinsurance customers will have the right to 
recapture  reinsurance  business  previously  assumed  by  the  Insurer.    At  March  31,  2007,  the  Insurer  has 
assumed an aggregate of up to $10.2 billion par in force and up to $88.0 million of unearned premium reserves 
(on a statutory basis). If all this reinsurance business were recaptured, the Insurer estimates it would have to 
disburse $63.4 million in cash to settle the recaptures.  A small portion of this reinsurance business from these 
customers is not subject to recapture.  The Insurer cannot provide any assurances as to whether the merger 
shall be consummated, and if so whether any or which of these customers will recapture all or any portion of 
this business upon consummation of the merger described above or the exact impact of the actual recapture, if 
any. 

TAX ALLOCATION FINANCING AND LIMITATIONS ON TAX REVENUES 

General 

The  Redevelopment  Law  provides  a  means  for  financing  redevelopment  projects  based  upon  an 
allocation of taxes collected within a project area.  The taxable valuation of a project area last equalized prior 
to adoption of the redevelopment plan, or base roll, is established and, except for any period during which the 
taxable  valuation  drops  below  the  base year  level,  the  taxing  agencies  within  the  project  area  (the  “Taxing 
Agencies”) thereafter receive the taxes produced by the levy of the then current tax rate upon the base roll.  
Taxes collected upon any increase in taxable valuation over the base roll (the “tax increment”) are allocated to 
a redevelopment agency and may be pledged by a redevelopment agency to the repayment of any indebtedness 
incurred in financing or refinancing a redevelopment project.  The tax increment, however, may be subject to a 
number  of  claims  and  reductions  which  are  prior  to  the  pledge  of  the  repayment  of  redevelopment  agency 
indebtedness, including, among others, pass-through agreements with the Taxing Agencies and administrative 
charges by the County.   

Article XIIIA of State Constitution 

On June 6, 1978, California voters approved an amendment (commonly known as both Proposition 13 
and the Jarvis–Gann Initiative) to the California Constitution. This amendment, which added Article XIII A to 
the  California  Constitution,  among  other  things  affects  the  valuation  of  real  property  for  the  purpose  of 
taxation in that it defines the full cash property value to mean “the county assessor’s valuation of real property 
as shown on the 1975–76 tax bill under ‘full cash value,’ or thereafter, the appraised value of real property 
newly  constructed,  or  when  a  change  in  ownership  has  occurred  after  the  1975  assessment.”  The  full  cash 
value may be adjusted annually to reflect inflation at a rate not to exceed 2 percent per year, or a reduction in 
the consumer price index or comparable local data at a rate not to exceed 2 percent per year, or reduced in the 
event of declining property value caused by damage, destruction or other factors including a general economic 

26 

 

 

downturn. The amendment further limits the amount of any ad valorem tax on real property to one percent of 
the full cash value except that additional taxes may be levied to pay debt service on indebtedness approved by 
the voters prior to July 1, 1978, and bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property 
approved on or after July 1, 1978, by two-thirds of the votes cast by the voters voting on the proposition.  

Legislation Implementing Article XIIIA 

Legislation enacted by the California Legislature to implement Article XIII A provides that all taxable 
property is shown at full assessed value. In conformity with this procedure, all taxable property value included 
in this Official Statement (except as noted) is shown at 100 percent of assessed value and all general tax rates 
reflect the $1 per $100 of taxable value. Future assessed valuation growth allowed under Article XIIIA (new 
construction, change of ownership, two percent annual value growth) will be allocated on the basis of “situs” 
among the jurisdictions that serve the tax rate area within which the growth occurs except for certain utility 
property assessed by the State Board of Equalization (“Unitary Property”) which is allocated by a different 
method. See “– Unitary Property” herein. 

Article XIIIB of State Constitution 

An 

initiative 

to  amend 

the  California  constitution  entitled  “Limitation  of  Government 
Appropriations,”  was  approved  on  September  6,  1979,  thereby  adding  Article  XIIIB  to  the  California 
Constitution (“Article XIIIB”).  Under Article XIIIB, as amended, state and local governmental entities have 
an  annual  “appropriations  limit”  and  are  not  permitted  to  spend  certain  moneys  which  are  called 
“appropriations subject to limitation” (consisting of tax revenues, state subventions and certain other funds) in 
an amount higher than the “appropriations limit.” 

The Redevelopment Law provides that the allocation and payment of taxes to a redevelopment agency 
for  the  purpose  of  paying  principal  of  or  interest  on  loans,  advances  or  indebtedness  incurred  for 
redevelopment activity shall not be deemed the receipt by the Agency of proceeds of taxes levied by or on 
behalf of an agency within the meaning or for the purpose of Article XIIIB of the State Constitution, nor shall 
such portion of taxes be deemed receipt of proceeds of taxes by, or an appropriation subject to the limitation 
of, any other public body within the meaning or for the purposes of Article XIIIB of the State Constitution or 
any statutory provision enacted in implementation of Article XIIIB. 

Unitary Property 

Assessed value derived from utility property assessed by the State Board of Equalization are allocated 
to each taxing entity in the County in the following manner (1) each taxing entity will receive the same amount 
as  in  the  previous  year  plus  an  increase  for  inflation  of  up  to  two  percent,  (2)  if  utility  tax  revenues  are 
insufficient to provide the same amount as in the previous year, each taxing entity’s share would be reduced 
pro-rata  county  wide,  and  (3)  any  increase  in  revenue  above  two  percent  would  be  allocated  in  the  same 
proportion  as  the  taxing  entity’s  local  secured  taxable  values  are  to  the  local  secured  taxable  values  of  the 
County.  The portion of tax revenues allocable to the Agency with respect to the Redevelopment Project Areas 
and  attributable  to  unitary  property  for  fiscal  year  2006-07  is  expected  to  be  $4,237  for  the  Southcrest 
Redevelopment Project Area, $581 for the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area and $7,661 for the 
Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area. 

Property Tax Collection Procedures 

For assessment and collection purposes, property is classified either as “secured” or “unsecured” and 
is listed accordingly on separate parts of the assessment roll.  The “secured roll” is that part of the assessment 
roll  containing  state–assessed  public  utilities  property  and  property  the  taxes  on  which  are  a  lien  on  real 
property sufficient, in the opinion of the County Assessor, to secure payment of the taxes.  Other property is 
assessed  on  the  “unsecured  roll.”  A  tax  levied  on  unsecured  property  does  not  become  a  lien  against  the 

27 

 

 

unsecured property but may become a lien on certain other property owned by the taxpayer.  Every tax which 
becomes a lien on secured property has a priority over all other liens arising pursuant to California law on the 
secured property, regardless of the time of creation of the other liens. 

Property taxes on the secured roll are due in two installments, on November 1 and February 1 of each 
Fiscal Year.  If unpaid, such taxes become delinquent on December 10 and April 10, respectively, and a 10% 
penalty attaches to any delinquent payment.  In addition, property on the secured roll with respect to which 
taxes are delinquent is sold to the State on or about June 30 of the Fiscal Year. Such property may thereafter be 
redeemed by payment of the delinquent taxes and delinquent penalty, plus a redemption penalty of 1-1/2% per 
month to the time of redemption.  If taxes are unpaid for a period of five years or more, the property is deeded 
to the State and then is subject to sale by the County Tax Collector. Current law provides for the supplemental 
assessment  and  taxation  of  property  as  of  the  occurrence  of  a  change  of  ownership  or  completion  of  new 
construction. 

Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due as of the January 1 lien date and become delinquent, if 
unpaid, on the following August 31.  A 10% penalty attaches to delinquent taxes on property on the unsecured 
roll,  and  an  additional  penalty  of  1-1/2%  per  month  begins  to  accrue  on  the  first  day  of  the  third  month 
following the delinquency date.  The taxing authority has four ways of collecting unsecured personal property 
taxes:  (1) a civil action against the taxpayer; (2) filing a certificate in the office of the County Clerk specifying 
certain facts in order to obtain a judgment lien on certain property of the taxpayer; (3) filing a certificate of 
delinquency for recording in the County Recorder’s office, in order to obtain a lien on certain property of the 
taxpayer;  and  (4)  seizure  and  sale  of  personal  property,  improvements  or  possessory  interests  belonging  or 
assessed to the assessee. 

The  County  offered  an  alternative  method  of  tax  apportionment  pursuant  to  Section  4701  of  the 
Revenue  and  Taxation  Code  of  the  State,  known  as  the  “Teeter  Plan,”  to  all  taxing  agencies,  districts, 
redevelopment  agencies  and  non–county  treasury  legal  depositories  in  the  County.  Participating  entities  are 
held harmless from property tax payment delinquencies in their jurisdictions in exchange for County retention 
of penalties and interest income derived when delinquent taxes are eventually paid.  Tax revenues allocated to 
local entities continue to reflect adjustments to the tax roll and property tax refunds.  The Agency does not 
participate  in  the  County’s  Teeter  Plan.    See  “RISK  FACTORS  –  Property  Tax  Payment  Delinquencies” 
herein. 

Plan Limitations 

Provisions of the Redevelopment Law and the Redevelopment Plans establish various time limits for 
undertaking redevelopment activities and for repaying debt incurred to finance redevelopment projects in the 
respective Redevelopment Project Areas.  These time limits for the Redevelopment Project Areas are set forth 
in Table 1 below.  Pursuant to Senate Bill 211, the City Council adopted Ordinance Nos. O-19417 and O-
19484  which  eliminated  the  time  limits  for  incurring  debt  that  previously  applied  to  the  Mount  Hope 
Redevelopment Project Area and the Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area.  Pursuant to Senate Bill 1045, 
adopted in connection with the approval of the State Budget for Fiscal Year 2003-04, redevelopment agencies 
are permitted to extend the effective date of their redevelopment plans and the date to receive tax increment 
revenues by one year.  The Agency is expecting to extend each of the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project 
Area and the Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area redevelopment plan time limits by one year.  In addition, 
pursuant  to  Senate  Bill  1096,  adopted  in  connection  with  the  approval  of  the  State  Budget  for  Fiscal  Year 
2004-05, the Agency expects to extend the effective date of the Mount Hope Redevelopment Plan and the date 
to  receive  its  tax  increment  revenues  by  two  years.    See  "RISK  FACTORS  –  Educational  Revenue 
Augmentation Fund" herein. 

The Agency may not receive and may not repay indebtedness with the proceeds from property taxes 
received  pursuant  to  Section  33670  of  the  Redevelopment  Law  and  the  Redevelopment  Plans  beyond  their 
respective  termination  dates,  except  to  repay  debt  established  in  order  to  fulfill  the  Agency’s  affordable 

28 

 

 

housing  obligations  under  Section  33333.8(a)  of  the  Redevelopment  Law.    There  is  presently  no  such 
outstanding debt. 

Pursuant to each Redevelopment Plan, there is a maximum amount of tax increment that the Agency 
may receive from the respective Redevelopment Project Area, and a maximum amount of outstanding bonded 
indebtedness that is payable from tax increment in the respective Redevelopment Project Area.  These limits 
are listed in Table 1 below. Payments to the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund are not included in this 
tax increment limitation. See “RISK FACTORS – Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund” herein.

The scheduled debt service on the Bonds is based on the assumption of a 2% annual increase in tax 
increment receipts in each respective Redevelopment Project Area. However, over the last several years the 
assessed  valuation  growth  in  each  Redevelopment  Project  Area  exceeded  this  assumed  2%  growth. 
Furthermore, depending on the rate of increase in the assessed value of property in the Redevelopment Project 
Areas, the Agency may reach the Tax Increment Limit for one or more of the Redevelopment Project Areas 
prior to the payment in full of the Bonds.  The annual average real property growth rate over the previous 10 
years  was  approximately  9%  for  the  Mount  Hope  Redevelopment  Project  Area,  19%  for  the  Southcrest 
Redevelopment Project Area and 14% for the original Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area together 
with the Central Imperial Redevelopment Area (Amendment No. 2 Area).  The annual average growth rate was 
approximately  8%  for  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Area  (Amendment  No.  3  Area)  over  the  last  4 
years.  This rate of growth may not continue, and it is possible for one or more of the Redevelopment Project 
Areas  to  experience  a  decline  in  assessed  value  in  the  future.    See  “RISK  FACTORS  –  Tax  Increment 
Estimates” and “– Reduction in Assessed Value” herein.  Based on the assumption that future growth matches 
the  growth  rates  described  above,  the  Agency  projects  that  the  tax  increment  limit  will  be  reached  during 
Fiscal Year 2022-23 for the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area (Original and Amendment No. 2 
Area), during Fiscal Year 2032-33 for the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area (Amendment No. 3 
Area),  during  Fiscal  Year  2017-18  for  the  Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project  Area,  and  during  Fiscal  Year 
2018-2019 for the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area. 

29 

 

 

The  Agency  is  pursuing  amendments  to  the  Redevelopment  Plan  for  each  Redevelopment  Project 
Area  to  increase  the  respective  tax  increment  limits  to  an  amount  expected  to  be  sufficient,  based  on  the 
historical growth rates described above, to meet the scheduled debt service requirements under the respective 
Loan  Agreements  while  the  Bonds  are  scheduled  to  be  outstanding.    The  proposed  amendments  to  the 
Redevelopment  Plans  would  require  public  hearings  and  various  governmental  approvals.    No  assurance  is 
made by the Agency that any or all of such Redevelopment Plans will be amended to increase its respective tax 
increment limitation or that, if amended, that any of such revised tax increment limits will be sufficient to pay 
the  Bonds  as  scheduled  if  growth  rates  in  assessed  value  exceed  the  rates  assumed  by  the  Agency  in 
determining the new proposed tax increment limit for a Redevelopment Project Area.   

Under each Loan Agreement, the Agency agrees to annually review the total amount of Tax Revenues 
remaining to be received by the Agency under the Tax Increment Limitation for the respective Redevelopment 
Project  Area,  without  deduction  for  any  amounts  reserved  to  taxing  entities  under  Health  and  Safety  Code 
Sections  33676,  33607.5  and  33607.7  or  under  other  provisions  of  Redevelopment  Law,  and  to  annually 
review  future  cumulative  Annual  Debt  Service  and  future  cumulative  payments  reserved  to  taxing  entities 
under  Health  and  Safety  Code  Sections  33676,  33607.5  and  33607.7  (or  under  other  provisions  of 
Redevelopment Law).  The Agency has covenanted not to accept Tax Revenues or incur additional obligations 
payable from Tax Revenues, if such acceptance or incurrence will cause the amount remaining under the Tax 
Increment  Limitation  to  fall  below  110%  of  remaining  aggregate  cumulative  debt  service  on  all  of  the 
Agency’s  Bonds  payable  from  such  Redevelopment  Project  Area,  estimated  future  aggregate  payments 
reserved to the taxing entities under Health and Safety Code Sections 33676, 33607.5 and 33607.7 or under 
other provisions of Redevelopment Law and other indebtedness established pursuant to Section 33333.2 of the 
Redevelopment  Law,  except  for  the  purpose  of  depositing  such  revenues  in  escrow  for  future  debt  service 
payment with respect to such Bonds, payments to such taxing entities or other indebtedness.  See “SECURITY 
FOR THE BONDS – Pledge under the Loan Agreements” and “RISK FACTORS – Tax Increment Estimates” 
herein and APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS” attached hereto. 

Filing of Agency Indebtedness 

Section 33675 of the Redevelopment Law provides for the filing not later than the first day of October 
of each year with the county auditor of a statement of indebtedness certified by the chief fiscal officer of the 
agency for each redevelopment project that receives tax increment.  The statement of indebtedness is required 
to contain the date on which any bonds were delivered, the principal amount, term, purpose and interest rate of 
bonds and the outstanding balance on bonds.  Similar information must be given for each loan, advance or 
indebtedness that the agency has incurred or entered into to be payable from tax increment.  

Section  33675  also  provides  that  the  county  auditor  is  limited  in  payment  of  tax  increment  to  the 
agency to the amounts shown on the agency’s statement of indebtedness. This law further provides that the 
statement of indebtedness is prima facie evidence of the indebtedness of the agency, but that the county auditor 
may dispute the amount of indebtedness shown on the statement in certain cases.  Provision is made for time 
limits under which the dispute can be made by the county auditor as well as provisions for determination by 
the Superior Court in a declaratory relief action of the property disposition of the matter.  The issue in any such 
action  must  involve  only  the  amount  of  the  indebtedness  and  not  the  validity  of  any  contract  or  debt 
instrument, or any expenditures pursuant thereto.  An exception is made for payments to a public agency in 
connection with payments by such public agency pursuant to a bond issue which shall not be disputed in any 
action under Section 33675. 

Property Tax Administrative Charges 

Counties  are  allowed  to  charge  for  the  cost  of  assessing,  collecting  and  allocating  property  tax 
revenues  to  local  government  jurisdictions  on  a  prorated  basis.  The  property  tax  administrative  charges  are 
included  as  a  deduction  to  tax  increment  revenues.  See  APPENDIX  A  –  “REPORT  OF  THE  FISCAL 
CONSULTANT” attached hereto. 

30 

 

 

Pass-Through Agreements 

Prior  to  the  adoption  of  Section  33607.5  of  the  Redevelopment  Law,  a  redevelopment  agency  was 
authorized to enter into an agreement to pay tax increment revenues to any taxing agency that had territory 
located within a redevelopment project area in an amount which in the agency’s determination was appropriate 
to alleviate any financial burden or detriment caused by the redevelopment project. These agreements normally 
provided for a pass-through of tax increment revenues directly to the affected taxing agency, and, therefore, are 
commonly referred to as “pass-through agreements.” 

Three  affected  taxing  entities,  the  San  Diego  Unified  School  District,  the  San  Diego  Office  of 
Education and the San Diego Community College District, made a determination that the Plan would have an 
adverse fiscal impact during the fiscal review period for the original Central Imperial Redevelopment Plan. To 
mitigate  this  impact,  the  Agency  agreed  to  pay  a  portion  of  the  tax  increment  revenues  from  the  original 
Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area to the taxing entities.  These agreements are collectively referred 
to as the “Pass-Through Agreements.”  Each of the Pass-Through Agreements is subordinate to the payment of 
debt service on the certain Agency obligations relating to the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area, 
including the payments due under the Central Imperial Loan Agreement.  See APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF 
THE FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto. 

Statutory Pass-Through Payments 

Section  33607.5  of  the  Redevelopment  Law  repealed  the  provisions  that  enabled  pass-through 
agreements,  although  existing  pass-through  agreements  remain  in  place.    Section  33607.5  replaces  the 
payments  from  new  pass-through  agreements  with  a  statutory  tax  increment  sharing  formula  for  all 
redevelopment  project  areas  established  on  or  after  January  1,  1994  and  requires  statutory  pass-through 
payments (“Statutory Pass-through Payments”) to all taxing entities.  Statutory Pass-through Payments are paid 
based on increases in revenue calculated pursuant to a statutory formula at several points in time over the term 
of  a  project  area’s  receipt  of  tax  increment.    See  APPENDIX  A  –  “REPORT  OF  THE  FISCAL 
CONSULTANT” attached hereto. 

The area added by Amendment No. 2 and area added by Amendment No. 3 to the Central Imperial 
Redevelopment Area are each subject to the statutory pass through requirements of Section 33607.5, which 
provides  for  Statutory  Pass-through  Payments  to  be  made  by  the  Agency  to  affected  taxing  entities.    The 
amount of Statutory Pass-through Payments under Section 33607.5 are computed as follows: (1) from the first 
fiscal year in which the Agency receives tax increment until the last fiscal year in which the Agency receives 
the tax increment, 25% of the tax increments are passed through to the entities (net of the 20% Housing set 
aside); (2) commencing in the eleventh year, an additional 21% of the tax increment in excess of the tenth year 
tax increment is passed through to the entities (net of the 20% housing set aside); and (3) commencing in the 
thirty first year, an additional 14% of the tax increment in excess of the thirtieth year tax increment is passed 
through to the entities (net of the 20% housing set aside).  For fiscal year 2006-07, tax increment revenues in 
the amount of approximately $145,000 for the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area are to be paid to 
taxing agencies as a result of statutory pass-through allocations.  See APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF THE 
FISCAL CONSULTANT”. 

Section 33607.7 was subsequently added to the Redevelopment Law to provide for Statutory Pass-
through  Payments  to  affected  taxing  entities  that  do  not  have  existing  tax  sharing  agreements  if  a 
redevelopment plan adopted prior to January 1, 1994 is amended to eliminate its time limit on the establishing 
of  loans,  advances  and  indebtedness.    In  determining  the  applicable  amount  of  Statutory  Pass-through 
Payments under this law, the first fiscal year of payment shall be the first fiscal year following the fiscal year 
in which the adjusted base year value is determined.  The adjusted base year value is the value of the Project 
Area in the year in which the limit being amended would have taken effect without the amendment.  

31 

 

 

The amount of Statutory Pass-through Payments under Section 33607.7 are computed as follows: (1) 
commencing from the first fiscal year in which the debt incurrence time limitation would have taken effect 
without the amendment (the adjusted base year), 25% of the tax increments are passed through to the entities 
(net  of  the  20%  Housing  set  aside);  (2)  commencing  in  the  eleventh  year,  an  additional  21%  of  the  tax 
increment in excess of the tenth year tax increment is passed through to the entities (net of the 20% housing set 
aside); and (3) commencing in the thirty first year, an additional 14% of the tax increment in excess of the 
thirtieth year tax increment is passed through to the entities (net of the 20% housing set aside). 

Statutory pass through obligations under Section 33607.7 were triggered by the Agency’s adoption of 
Ordinances 19484 and 19417, to eliminate the debt incurrence time limit for the Southcrest Redevelopment 
Project Area and Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area, pursuant to SB 211.  For fiscal year 2006-07, tax 
increment revenues in the amount of approximately $69,000 for the Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area 
and $66,000 of for the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area are to be paid to taxing agencies as a result of 
statutory  pass-through  allocations.    See  APPENDIX  A  –  “REPORT  OF  THE  FISCAL  CONSULTANT” 
attached hereto. 

The  Statutory  Pass-through  Payments  may  be  subordinated  to  payments  due  on  indebtedness 
(including the payments due under the Loan Agreements) if the Agency requests an affected taxing entity to 
subordinate the Statutory Pass-through Payments and the Agency provides the affected taxing with substantial 
evidence  that sufficient  funds  will be available  to pay  both  the  debt  service  and the  Statutory Pass-through 
Payments,  when  due.    The  affected  taxing  entity  must  approve  or  disapprove  the  request  for  subordination 
within 45 days of the Agency's request, and if the affected taxing entity does not act on the request within 45 
days, the subordination request is deemed to be approved.  The Agency sent letters and provided evidence that 
sufficient funds will be available to pay debt service due on under the Loan Agreements and other applicable 
indebtedness of the Agency and the Statutory Pass-through Payments to the taxing entities entitled to Statutory 
Pass-through Payments.  The Agency has received confirmation of subordination from taxing agencies that are 
entitled to approximately 99% of the total Statutory Pass-through Payments payable from the Redevelopment 
Project Areas.  The Agency expects to obtain subordination of the Statutory Pass-through Payments from the 
remaining affected taxing entities, although the Agency can not guarantee this result. 

The  tables  under  “SOUTHCREST  REDEVELOPMENT  PROJECT  AREA  –  Projected  Tax 
Revenues”, “CENTRAL IMPERIAL REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA – Projected Tax Revenues” and 
“MOUNT  HOPE  REDEVELOPMENT  PROJECT  AREA  –  Projected  Tax  Revenues”  assume  that  the 
Statutory Pass-through Payments have not been subordinated.   

Section 33676 Resolutions 

Pursuant  to  Section  33676  of  the  Redevelopment  Law,  the  County,  the  San  Diego  Unified  School 
District and the San Diego Community College District have elected to be allocated a portion of tax increment 
revenues  generated  by  the  Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project  Area  and  the  original  Central  Imperial 
Redevelopment Project Area attributable to increases in their override tax rates, and increases in the assessed 
value  of  taxable  property  in  the  Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project  Area  and  the  original  Central  Imperial 
Redevelopment Project Area attributable to a maximum annual inflationary growth of 2 percent allowed by 
Article XIIIA of the California Constitution.  Allocations resulting from the inflationary increase in value are 
computed by the County by compounding the base year value of a redevelopment project by two percent per 
year and allocating to the electing taxing entity its share of base levy (1%) taxes generated by the difference 
between the compounded and actual base year value.  Payments are paid to these entities prior to the allocation 
of Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area Tax Revenues and original Central Imperial Redevelopment Project 
Area  Tax  Revenues  to  the  Agency.    For  fiscal  year  2006-07,  these  payments  totaled  $168,665  from  the 
Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project  Area  and  $87,000  from  the  original  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment 
Project Area.  See APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF THE FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto. 

32 

 

 

Low and Moderate Income Housing Set-Aside 

The Redevelopment Law requires that except under certain circumstances, redevelopment agencies set 
aside  20%  of  all  gross  tax  increment  derived  from  redevelopment  project  areas  into  a  low  and  moderate 
income  housing  fund, to be  used  for  the  purpose  of  increasing,  improving  and  preserving  the community’s 
supply of low and moderate income housing.  Housing Set–Aside Amounts are pledged to and are available to 
pay 20% of the debt service on the Bonds.  A portion of the proceeds of the Bonds is to be deposited into the 
Agency’s  Low  and  Moderate  Income  Housing  Fund.  See  “SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS”,  and 
APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF THE FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto.

General 

SOUTHCREST REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA 

The Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area was formally created with the adoption of the Southcrest 
Plan on April 14, 1986 by Ordinance No. 16622.  The redevelopment plan for the Southcrest Project Area was 
approved  by  the  City  Council  pursuant  to  Ordinance  No.  16622,  finally  adopted  on  April  14,  1986.    As 
described in the Southcrest Redevelopment Plan, the principal redevelopment goal for this area is to revitalize 
deteriorating  commercial  and  residential  areas,  redevelop  the  rescinded  Highway  252  corridor,  and  provide 
business and employment opportunities for the residents of the southeastern community. 

The Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area encompasses approximately 301 acres in the southeastern 
area of the City of San Diego.  The Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area is bordered on the west by State 
Route 15 and Interstate 5, to the east by 44th Street, to the south by Gamma and Vesta Streets and to the north 
by Logan Avenue.  The Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area, encompasses a variety of land uses including 
residential, commercial and business park property, park space and open space. 

Historical and Current Development 

The Southcrest Park Plaza retail and commercial development was completed in 1995 and includes 
Lucky’s  Foods,  Sav-On,  Pep  Boys,  other  neighborhood  small  businesses  and  the  Southcrest  Cultural  Arts 
Center.  In 1998, Phase I of the Southcrest Park Estates residential development was completed, providing 33 
affordable,  single-family,  three-  and  four-bedroom  homes.    The  38th  Street  Development  provided  four 
affordable single-family homes and Boston Village provided 12 affordable single-family homes.  Construction 
of the design award-winning Cesar Chavez Elementary School was completed in 1997.   

Southcrest  Park  Estates  Phase  II  was  completed  in  2004,  providing  an  additional  62  moderately-
priced, single-family, three and four-bedroom homes with both price and owner occupancy restrictions.  These 
units were the lowest priced new homes sold in San Diego County during 2004 and 2005.  Ten of the homes 
are restricted for 45 years to affordability to low-to-moderate income households, which is consistent with the 
Agency’s inclusionary requirements.  A 10 year owner-occupancy restriction applies to all 62 homes to help 
maintain neighborhood stability. 

In 2004, the Agency entered into an Owner Participation Agreement with the Olson Company for the 
development  of  110  town  homes,  Legacy  Walk,  on  an  approximate  6  acre  site  located  at  43rd  Street  and 
National Avenue.  Construction of the town homes began in 2005, and over seventy-five percent of the units 
have been constructed and sold to date (but only six of which have been reflected on the 2006-07 tax roll).  
Eleven of the homes built on-site have prices restricted for affordable to families earning up to 100% of area 
median income in compliance with the City’s Inclusionary Housing Program.  All 110 homes are restricted as 
owner-occupied for a period of ten years. 

There are a number of new developments occurring in the Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area 
that are anticipated to add assessed value and generate additional tax increment for the Agency within the next 
five years.  The following summarizes these new developments. Except for completed projects there can be no 
guaranty that the projects will be completed as, or in the timeframe, proposed.

Plan Limitations 

The  Southcrest  Redevelopment  Plan  establishes  various  time  limits  for  undertaking  redevelopment 
activities and for repaying debt incurred to finance redevelopment projects in the Southcrest Redevelopment 
Project Area.  See “TAX ALLOCATION FINANCING AND LIMITATIONS ON TAX REVENUES – Plan 
Limitations” for a description of these limitations. 

Outstanding Debt 

As of the date of issuance of the Bonds, there will be no bonded indebtedness (except for the Loan 
related to the Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area) secured by tax increment generated from the Southcrest 
Redevelopment Project Area.  See “PLAN OF FINANCE” herein. 

The Agency has entered into long–term loans with the City in the aggregate amount of approximately 
$18,807,764 that are payable from tax increment generated from the Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area 
on a basis subordinate to the Loans.  The Agency also has other miscellaneous obligations in the aggregate 
amount of $35,623 payable from tax increment generated from the Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area. 
These loans and other obligations may not be accelerated in a manner which may adversely affect the payment 
of debt service on the Loan related to the Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area. 

Tax  increment  from  the  Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project  Area  is  subject  to  certain  pass-through 
agreements  and  statutory  tax  sharing.    See  “SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS”,  “TAX  ALLOCATION 
FINANCING AND LIMITATIONS ON TAX REVENUES” herein and APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF THE 
FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto.

Assessment Appeals 

Property  owners  in  the City  can  appeal the  assessment  of their property  to the County  Assessment 
Appeals Board. Property taxable values may be reduced as a result of a successful appeal of the taxable value 
of property determined by the County Assessor.  An appeal may result in a reduction to the County Assessor’s 
original taxable value and a tax refund to the applicant property owner.  The Fiscal Consultant researched the 
status  of  assessment  appeals  in  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  with  the  County  and  determined  that  for 
fiscal year 2006-07 no appeals has been filed and for fiscal year 2005-06 there were 6 appeals, 5 of which were 
withdrawn and 1 resolved with no change in value.  The Fiscal Consultant has not made any adjustments for 
appeals in the projections under “– Projected Tax Revenues” below or in the Report of the Fiscal Consultant.  
See  “RISK  FACTORS  –  Assessment  Appeals”  herein  and  APPENDIX  A  –  “REPORT  OF  THE  FISCAL 
CONSULTANT” attached hereto.

General 

CENTRAL IMPERIAL REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA 

The redevelopment plan for the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area (the “Central Imperial 
Redevelopment Plan”) was approved by the City Council pursuant to Ordinance No. 0-17831, finally adopted 
on  September  14,  1992,  as  amended  by  Ordinance  No.  0-18252,  finally  adopted  on  January  18,  1996,  as 
further  amended  by  Ordinance  No.  0-18367,  finally  adopted  on  December  10,  1996,  which  expanded  the 
Central Imperial Project Area to include approximately 115 additional acres on the west side of Interstate 805 
(the “Expansion Area”) and as further amended by Ordinance No. 0-18882, finally adopted on October 24, 
2000.  As described in the Central Imperial Redevelopment Plan, the principal redevelopment goal for this area 
is  to  improve  and  rehabilitate property, to  provide incentives  for  development  of property  and employment 
opportunities, and to increase communication relating to such redevelopment activities among the residents. 

The  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Project  Area  encompasses  approximately  580  acres  in  the 
Southeastern area of the City. The portion of the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area that is located 
west of Interstate 805 (constituting most of the Expansion Area) is generally bounded east of 41st Street, north 
of Ocean View Boulevard and south of the Eastline Trolly. The portion of the Central Imperial Redevelopment 
Project Area that is located east of Interstate 805 is generally bounded on the west by Euclid Avenue, north of 
Ocean View Boulevard and south of G Street and Guymon Street. The Project also extends east from Euclid 
Avenue  to  Flicker  Street,  generally  between  Market  Street  and  Imperial  Avenue.  The  Central  Imperial 
Redevelopment Project Area is composed primarily of residential and commercial land uses. 

Historical and Current Development 

The  Agency’s  residential  redevelopment  activities  for  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Project 
Area  have  included  the  development  of  over  175  primarily  single-family  residential  units  in  the  Sunshine 
Garden,  Knox  Glen,  Kings Row,  Casa  de  Sueños,  Jarrett  Heights,  Evergreen  Village  and  Village  at  Euclid 
housing developments.   

In 2005, SEDC completed the acquisition of an approximately 10 acre site at Hilltop Drive and Euclid 
Avenue  which  is  currently  proposed  for  a  mix  of  development.    A  relocation  plan  was  prepared  and 
implemented for the existing nine households during 2005.  In 2006, SEDC issued a public notice inviting bids 
and selected the lowest bidding contractor to demolish the structures at the site.  Demolition was completed in 
October, 2006.  

In  2006,  negotiations  began  for  various  developments  within  the  Imperial  Avenue  Corridor  Master 
Plan area.  Exclusive negotiating agreements are contemplated for a development of up to 35 residential units 
at the Ouchi Courtyards development located at 50th Street and Imperial Avenue, and for a development of up 
to  100  residential  units  on  Imperial  Avenue  near  66th  Street.    Negotiations  are  continuing  for  additional 
residential and mixed-use developments within the Imperial Avenue Corridor Master Plan area. 

Four commercial developments have been completed in the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project 

Area: 

The Ultramar Gas Station was completed in 1998, and includes a one-story retail mini-mart, self-serve 

gasoline station with canopy and an automatic car wash. 

Phase  I  of  Market  Creek  Plaza  was  completed  in  2002,  including  new  construction  of  a  142,000 
square foot retail center anchored by Food 4 Less and includes a food court as well as general commercial and 
specialty shops.   

42 

 

 

Imperial Marketplace is the location of an approximately 300,000 square foot retail/office complex 
anchored  by  Home  Depot.    Imperial  Marketplace  also  contains  a  Sizzler’s,  Starbuck’s,  Subway,  99¢  Only 
Store,  Greenwood  Floral,  and  Domino’s  Pizza.    Construction  of  an  8,000  square  foot  Navy  Federal  Credit 
Union will begin in July, 2007.  One building pad remains to be completed for an approximately 35,000 square 
foot structure. 

The Valencia Business Park is a light industrial/commercial development of up to 100,000 square feet 
on an approximately 8-acre site.  In 2002, SEDC completed all necessary public infrastructure improvements 
including  elevating  the  site  out  of  the  flood  plain,  preparing  building  pads,  expanding  the  capacity  of  Las 
Chollas Creek, installing all related utilities, a new public street, along with sidewalk, curb and gutter. Since 
2004, within the Valencia Business Park, the 25,000 square-foot Earl B. Gillam Encanto Post Office facility 
has  been  completed,  as  well  as  a  unique  public  art  bus  shelter.    In  2005,  a  Request  for  Proposals  for 
development of the balance of the site of up to 65,000 square feet was issued and a developer selected.  A 
development agreement with the selected developer was approved in November, 2006. 

In 2006, SEDC negotiated a Third Implementation Agreement to the Disposition and Development 
Agreement  with  TayRad  LLC  for the  assumption of  the development obligations  by  Har-Bro Construction, 
Inc.    The  2-acre  development  site  located  at  54th  and  Market  Streets  will  provide  two  15,000  square-foot 
industrial buildings, as well as improvements to remove the site from the flood plain.  Site grading began in 
March, 2007, and completion of construction is scheduled for the first quarter of 2008. 

There  are  a  number  of  new  developments  occurring  in  the  Central  Imperial  Project  Area  that  are 
anticipated to add assessed value and generate additional tax increment for the Agency within the next five 
years.  The  following  summarizes  these  new  developments.  Except  for  completed  projects  there  can  be  no 
guaranty that the projects will be completed as, or in the timeframe, proposed.

The  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Plan  establishes  various  time  limits  for  undertaking 
redevelopment  activities  and  for  repaying  debt  incurred  to  finance  redevelopment  projects  in  the  Central 
Imperial Redevelopment Project Area.  See “TAX ALLOCATION FINANCING AND LIMITATIONS ON 
TAX REVENUES – Plan Limitations” for a description of these limitations. 

Outstanding Debt 

As of the date of issuance of the Bonds, there will be no bonded indebtedness (except for the Loan 
related  to  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Project  Area)  secured  by  tax  increment  generated  from  the 
Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area.  See “PLAN OF FINANCE” herein. 

The Agency has entered into long–term loans with the City in the aggregate amount of approximately 
$29,312,283 that are payable from tax increment generated from the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project 
Area  on  a  basis  subordinate  to  the  Loans.    The  Agency  also  has  other  miscellaneous  obligations  in  the 
aggregate  amount  of  $413,946  payable  from  tax  increment  generated  from  the  Central  Imperial 
Redevelopment Project Area. These loans and other obligations may not be accelerated in a manner which may 

43 

 

 

adversely  affect  the  payment  of  debt  service  on  the  Loan  related  to  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment 
Project Area. 

Tax  increment  from  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Project  Area  is  subject  to  certain  pass-
through agreement and statutory tax sharing.  See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS”, “TAX ALLOCATION 
FINANCING AND LIMITATIONS ON TAX REVENUES” herein and APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF THE 
FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto. 

Tax Rate 

The  tax  rate  for  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Project  Area  for  fiscal  year  2005-06  was 
1.010222%.    For  historical  tax  rates,  see  APPENIDIX  A  –  “REPORT  OF  THE  FISCAL  CONSULTANT” 
attached hereto.  The projections herein and in the Report of the Fiscal Consultant assume a tax rate of 1.00%. 

Ten Largest Assessees 

The  table  below  sets  forth  the  ten  largest  assessees  in  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Project 
Area.    The  cumulative  taxable  value  of  the  ten  largest  assessees  is  $79,100,472,  which  represents 
approximately  27.61%  of  the  total  taxable  value  of  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Project  Area  and 
38.68% of the incremental value of the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area.  The taxable value of 
the largest assessee, Jacobs Facilities LLC, represents approximately 6.75% of the total taxable value in the 
Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area.

Assessment Appeals 

Property  owners  in  the City  can  appeal the  assessment  of their property  to the County  Assessment 
Appeals Board. Property taxable values may be reduced as a result of a successful appeal of the taxable value 
of property determined by the County Assessor.  An appeal may result in a reduction to the County Assessor’s 
original taxable value and a tax refund to the applicant property owner.  The Fiscal Consultant researched the 
status  of  assessment  appeals  in  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  with  the  County  and  determined  that  for 
fiscal year 2006-07 no appeals has been filed and for fiscal year 2005-06 there were 6 appeals, 5 of which were 
withdrawn and 1 resolved with no change in value.  The Fiscal Consultant has not made any adjustments for 
appeals in the projections under “– Projected Tax Revenues” below or in the Report of the Fiscal Consultant.  
See  “RISK  FACTORS  –  Assessment  Appeals”  herein  and  APPENDIX  A  –  “REPORT  OF  THE  FISCAL 
CONSULTANT” attached hereto.

General 

MOUNT HOPE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA 

The  Mount  Hope  Redevelopment  Project  Area  was  formally  created  with  the  adoption  of  the 
Redevelopment  Plan  on  November  22,  1982  by  Ordinance  No.  0-15862.  As  described  in  the  Mount  Hope 
Redevelopment Plan, the principal redevelopment goal for this area is to revitalize deteriorating commercial 
and residential areas, redevelop the rescinded Highway 252 corridor, and provide business and employment 
opportunities for the residents of the southeastern community. 

The Mount Hope Redevelopment Plan describes the boundaries of the Mount Hope Redevelopment 
Project Area, contains a general statement of the objectives of the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area, 
land use, layout of principal streets, building intensities and standards, and other criteria proposed as the basis 
for redevelopment of the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area. The Mount Hope Redevelopment Plan 
also describes how it effectuates the purposes of the Act and how the proposed redevelopment conforms to the 
General Plan of the City, and describes the impact of the Mount Hope Redevelopment Plan upon residents 
thereof and upon the surrounding neighborhood. 

Historical and Current Development 

A 66-acre site (formerly unimproved cemetery property) was acquired and developed by SEDC on 
behalf of the Agency, as the Gateway Center East Business Park, home to approximately 1,400 employees and 
33 businesses, including Wallace Commercial Press, Costco, Quality Cabinets and Life Deck. 

Since 2006, SEDC has hosted a series of meetings with the residents and business owners in Mount 
Hope to provide residents the opportunity to discuss the redevelopment potential focused on the Market Street 
Corridor, identify public infrastructure improvements needs, and provide the community dialogue to potential 
developers  of  Agency-owned  sites.    The  Market  Street  corridor  provides  an  opportunity  for  mixed-use 
commercial/residential development.   The Agency-owned sites currently located on the corridor is expected  
to  be  used  to  assist  with  this  development.    A  development  feasibility  analysis  of  the  site  is  currently 
underway. 

Plan Limitations 

The Mount Hope Redevelopment Plan establishes various time limits for undertaking redevelopment 
activities and for repaying debt incurred to finance redevelopment projects in the Mount Hope Redevelopment 
Project Area.  See “TAX ALLOCATION FINANCING AND LIMITATIONS ON TAX REVENUES – Plan 
Limitations” for a description of these limitations. 

Outstanding Debt 

In  addition  to  the  indebtedness  under  the  Loan  related  to  the  Mount  Hope  Redevelopment  Project 
Area, the Agency’s Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Tax Allocation Bonds, Series 1995A outstanding in 
an aggregate principal amount of $840,000 (the “Mount Hope 1995A Bonds”) and the Agency’s Mount Hope 
Redevelopment  Project  Tax  Allocation  Bonds,  Series  2002A  (the  “Mount  Hope  2002A  Bonds"  and 
collectively  with  the  Mount  Hope  1995A  Bonds,  the  "Unrefunded  Mount  Hope  Bonds")  outstanding  in  an 
aggregate principal amount of $3,055,000 are payable from Tax Revenues on a parity with the payments due 
under the Mount Hope Loan Agreement.  See “PLAN OF FINANCE” herein. 

The Agency has entered into long–term loans with the City in the aggregate amount of approximately 
$4,481,151 that are payable from tax increment generated from the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area 
on a basis subordinate to the Loans.  The Agency also has other miscellaneous obligations in the aggregate 
amount of $24,257 payable from tax increment generated from the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area. 

50 

 

 

These loans and other obligations may not be accelerated in a manner which may adversely affect the payment 
of debt service on the Loan related to the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area. 

Tax  increment  from  the  Mount  Hope  Redevelopment  Project  Area  is  also  subject  to  certain  pass-
through agreements and statutory tax sharing.  See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS”, “TAX ALLOCATION 
FINANCING AND LIMITATIONS ON TAX REVENUES” herein and APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF THE 
FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto.

Assessment Appeals 

Property  owners  in  the City  can  appeal the  assessment  of their property  to the County  Assessment 
Appeals Board. Property taxable values may be reduced as a result of a successful appeal of the taxable value 
of property determined by the County Assessor.  An appeal may result in a reduction to the County Assessor’s 
original taxable value and a tax refund to the applicant property owner.  The Fiscal Consultant researched the 
status  of  assessment  appeals  in  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  with  the  County  and  determined  that  for 
fiscal year 2006-07 no appeals has been filed and for fiscal year 2005-06 there were 6 appeals, 5 of which were 
withdrawn and 1 resolved with no change in value.  The Fiscal Consultant has not made any adjustments for 
appeals in the projections under “– Projected Tax Revenues” below or in the Report of the Fiscal Consultant.  
See  “RISK  FACTORS  –  Assessment  Appeals”  herein  and  APPENDIX  A  –  “REPORT  OF  THE  FISCAL 
CONSULTANT” attached hereto.

RISK FACTORS 

Prospective investors should carefully consider the factors set forth below regarding an investment in 
the Bonds and other information contained in this Official Statement. The following discussion of risk factors 
is  not  intended  to  be  a  complete  list  of  the  risks  associated  with  the  purchase  of  the  Bonds  and  does  not 
necessarily reflect the relative importance of the various risks.  Potential investors of the Bonds are advised to 
consider the following factors, among others, and to review the other information in this Official Statement in 
evaluating the Bonds. In addition, there can be no assurance that other risk factors will not become material in 
the  future;  and  the  Agency  has  not  undertaken  to  advise  investors  of  such  other  risk  factors  should  they 
become known. 

Tax Increment Estimates 

The  maximum  amount  of  tax  increment  the  Agency  may  receive  from:  (i)  the  Southcrest 
Redevelopment Project Area is $87,000,000 (ii) the Central Imperial Redevelopment Project Area (Original 
and  Amendment  No.  2  Area)  is  $142,000,000,  (iii)  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment  Project  Area 
(Amendment  No.  3  Area)  is  $20,000,000,  and  (iv)  the  Mount  Hope  Redevelopment  Project  Area  is 
$47,000,000.  As of the end of Fiscal Year 2005-06, the Agency had received approximately (i) $9,062,754 
from  the  Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project  Area  (ii)  $6,157,071  from  the  Central  Imperial  Redevelopment 
Project Area (Original and Amendment No. 2 Area), (iii) $702,692 from the Central Imperial Redevelopment 
Project Area (Amendment No. 3 Area), and (iv) $15,128,090 from the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project 
Area.    The  Agency  has  retained  the  Fiscal  Consultant  to  estimate  the  tax  increment  available  to  pay  debt 
service  on  the  Bonds.  The  Fiscal  Consultant  has  made  certain  assumptions  with  regard  to  the  assessed 
valuation in each of the Redevelopment Project Areas, future tax rates, percentage of taxes collected, and the 
amount of funds available for investment.  The Agency believes these assumptions to be reasonable, however, 
to  the  extent  that  the  assessed  valuation,  the  tax  rates,  or  the  percentage  of  taxes  collected  are  less  than 
projected by the Fiscal Consultant, the tax increment available to pay debt service on the Bonds may be less 
than  projected  in  the  tables  herein.  See  APPENDIX  A  –  “REPORT  OF  THE  FISCAL  CONSULTANT” 
attached hereto.  

Depending  on  the  rate  of  increase  in  the  assessed  value  of  property  in  the  Redevelopment  Project 
Areas, the Agency may reach the Tax Increment Limit for one or more of the Redevelopment Project Areas 
while  the  Bonds  are  outstanding.      See  “SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS  –  Pledge  under  the  Loan 
Agreements”,  “TAX  ALLOCATION  FINANCING  AND  LIMITATIONS  ON  TAX  REVENUES  –  Plan 
Limitations” herein and APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF THE FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto. 

If future growth rates match recent historical growth, it is likely that the Tax Increment Limit for one 
or more of the Redevelopment Project Areas will be reached before the final maturity date of the Bonds.  See 
“TAX  ALLOCATION  FINANCING  AND  LIMITATIONS  ON  TAX  REVENUES  –  Plan  Limitations” 
herein.  The Agency has covenanted not to accept Tax Revenues or incur additional obligations payable from 
Tax  Revenues  if  such  acceptance  or  incurrence  will  cause  the  amount  remaining  under  the  Tax  Increment 
Limitation to fall below a certain level, except for the purpose of depositing such revenues in escrow for future 
debt  service  payments.    See  “TAX  ALLOCATION  FINANCING  AND  LIMITATIONS  ON  TAX 
REVENUES  –  Plan  Limitations”  herein  and  APPENDIX  C  –  “SUMMARY  OF  PRINCIPAL  LEGAL 
DOCUMENTS” attached hereto. 

In  addition,  the  Agency  is  pursuing  an  amendment  to  the  Redevelopment  Plan  for  each 
Redevelopment  Project  Area    to  increase  the  respective  tax  increment  limits  to  an  amount  expected  to  be 
sufficient,  based  on  the  historical  growth  rates  described  under  “TAX  ALLOCATION  FINANCING  AND 
LIMITATIONS ON TAX REVENUES – Plan Limitations”, to meet the scheduled debt service requirements 
under  the  respective  Loan  Agreements  while  the  Bonds  are  scheduled  to  be  outstanding.    The  proposed 
amendments to the Redevelopment Plans would require public hearings and various governmental approvals.  
No assurance is made by the Agency that any or all of such Redevelopment Plans will be amended to increase 

56 

 

 

its respective tax increment limitation or that, if amended, that any of such revised tax increment limits will be 
sufficient to pay the Bonds as scheduled if growth rates in assessed value exceed the rates assumed by the 
Agency in determining the new proposed tax increment limit for a Redevelopment Project Area.   

Reduction in Assessed Value 

Tax Revenues allocated to the Agency are determined in part by the amount by which the assessed 
valuation of property in a Redevelopment Project Area exceeds the respective base year assessed valuation for 
such property, and by the current rate at which property in such Redevelopment Project Area is taxed. The 
Agency itself has no taxing power with respect to property, nor does it have the authority to affect the rate at 
which property is taxed.  Assessed valuation of taxable property within the Redevelopment Project Areas may 
be reduced by economic factors beyond the control of the Agency, such as a downturn in the local economy, 
relocation out of the Redevelopment Project Area by one or more major property owners or sale of property to 
a non-profit corporation exempt from property taxation, or by substantial damage, destruction or condemnation 
of  such  property.    See  “–  Real  Estate  and  General  Economic  Risks,”  “–Risk  of  Earthquake  and  Other 
Disasters” and “–Concentration of Ownership” below.  Such a reduction could have an adverse affect on the 
Agency’s ability to make timely payments of principal and interest due under the Loans. 

Substantial  growth  has  occurred  in  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  in  recent  years.  However,  a 
reduction  of  the  assessed  valuation  of  taxable  property  in  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  caused  by 
economic factors or other factors beyond the Agency’s control, such as relocation out of the Redevelopment 
Project Areas by one or more major property owners, successful appeals by property owners for a reduction in 
a property’s assessed valuation, a reduction of the general inflationary rate, a reduction in transfers of property 
or construction activity, or the destruction of property caused by natural or other disasters, or other events that 
permit  reassessment  of  property  at  lower  values  could  result  in  a  reduction  of  tax  increment  revenues.  In 
addition, substantial delinquencies in the payment of property taxes by the owners of taxable property within 
the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  could  impair  the  timely  receipt  by  the  Agency  of  Tax  Revenues.  See  “– 
Reduction  in  Inflationary  Rate”  and  “–  Risk  of  Earthquake  and  Other  Disasters”  herein.  Further,  the  State 
electorate or legislature could adopt further limitations with the effect of reducing Tax Revenues. See “TAX 
ALLOCATION  FINANCING  AND  LIMITATIONS  ON  TAX  REVENUES  –  Property  Tax  Rate  and 
Appropriation Limitations” herein and “– Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund” herein. Other events that 
are beyond the control of the Agency could occur and cause a reduction in Tax Revenues, thereby impairing 
the ability of the Agency to make payments of principal and interest and premium (if any) when due on the 
Bonds on a timely basis. See APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF THE FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto. 

The Fiscal Consultant has made certain assumptions with regard to the availability of tax increment 
revenues to estimate the total revenues available to pay debt service on the Bonds. The Agency believes these 
assumptions to be reasonable, but to the extent tax increment revenues are less than anticipated, including for 
any of the reasons set forth in the previous paragraph, the total revenues available to pay debt service on the 
Bonds  or  to  refinance  the  Bonds  may  be  less  than  those  projected  herein.  No  independent  third  party  has 
reviewed the estimates or assumptions made by the Agency, unless specifically referenced herein.   

Reduction in Inflationary Rate 

Article XIII A of the California Constitution provides that the full cash value base of real property 
used in determining taxable value may be adjusted from year to year to reflect the inflation rate, not to exceed 
a two percent increase for any given year, or may be reduced to reflect a reduction in the consumer price index, 
comparable local data or any reduction in the event of declining property value caused by damage, destruction 
or  other  factors  (as  described  herein).  This  measure  is  computed  on  a  calendar  year  basis.  Any  resulting 
reduction in the full cash value base over the term of the Bonds could reduce Tax Revenues available to pay 
the principal of and interest on the Loans securing the Bonds.  See “TAX ALLOCATION FINANCING AND 
LIMITATIONS ON TAX REVENUES” herein.

Real Estate and General Economic Risks 

The general economy of the area in and surrounding the Redevelopment Project Areas is subject to all 
the  risks  generally  associated  with  real  estate  and  real  estate  development.  Projected  redevelopment  of  real 
property within and around the Redevelopment Project Areas by the Agency and private development may be 
adversely  affected  by  changes  in  general  economic  conditions,  fluctuations  in  the  real  estate  market  and 
interest rates, unexpected increases in development costs and by other similar factors.  The County’s real estate 
market has shown some recent signs of weakening.  During the first quarter of 2007, residential foreclosures 
have increased to reach their highest numbers since late 1996.  Further, real estate development within and 
around  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  could  be  adversely  affected  by  future  governmental  policies, 
including  governmental  policies  to  restrict  or  control  certain  kinds  of  development.  If  development  and 
redevelopment  activities  in  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  encounter  significant  obstacles  of  the  kind 
described  herein  or  other  impediments,  the  economy  of  the  area  in  and  around  the  Redevelopment  Project 
Areas could be adversely affected, causing  reduction of the Tax Revenues.  In addition, if there is a decline in 
the general economy of the region, the City or the Redevelopment Project Areas, the owners of property within 
the Redevelopment Project Areas may be less able or less willing to make timely payments of property taxes, 
causing a delay or cessation in the receipt of tax revenues received by the Agency from the Redevelopment 
Project Areas. 

Assessment Appeals 

Property  taxable  values  may  be  reduced  as  a  result  of  a  successful  appeal  of  the  taxable  value  of 
property determined by the County Assessor. An appeal may result in a reduction to the County Assessor’s 
original taxable value and a tax refund to the applicant property owner.  An assessee may contest either (i) the 
original determination of the “base assessment value” of a parcel (i.e., the value assigned after a change of 
ownership  or  completion  of  new  construction),  or  (ii)  the  “current  assessment  value”  (i.e.,  the  value  as 
determined  by  the  County  Assessor,  which  may  be  no  more  than  the  base  assessment  value  plus  the 
compounded 2% annual inflation factor) when specified factors have caused the market value of the parcel to 
drop below current assessment value. At the time of reassessment, after a change of ownership or completion 
of new construction, the assessee may appeal the base assessment value of the property.  Under an appeal of a 
base assessment value, the assessee appeals the actual underlying market value of the sales transaction or the 
recently completed improvement.  A successful appeal of the base assessment value of a parcel has significant 
future revenue impacts, because a reduced base year assessment will reduce the compounded future value of 
the property prospectively.  Except for the two percent inflation factor, the value of the property cannot be 
increased until a change in ownership occurs or improvements are made.  Reductions in taxable values in the 
Redevelopment Project Areas resulting from successful appeals by property owners will reduce the amount of 
Tax Revenues available to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds. The Fiscal Consultant researched the 
status  of  assessment  appeals  in  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  with  the  County  and  determined  that  for 
fiscal year 2006-07 no appeals has been filed and for fiscal year 2005-06 there were 6 appeals, 5 of which were 
withdrawn and 1 resolved with no change in value.  The Fiscal Consultant has not made any adjustments for 
appeals in the projections herein or in the Report of the Fiscal Consultant.  See APPENDIX A – “REPORT OF 
THE FISCAL CONSULTANT” attached hereto.  Reductions in taxable values in the Redevelopment Project 
Areas resulting from successful appeals by property owners will reduce the amount of Tax Revenues available 
to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds. 

Investment of Tax Revenues 

Tax Revenues from the County are deposited in the City’s Investment Pool prior to the deposit of the 
Revenues with the Trustee.  Under the Indentures, moneys held by the Trustee must be invested by the Trustee 
and Agency, as applicable, in Permitted Investments. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Investments” and 
APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS” attached hereto. The Agency cannot 
predict the impact on the investment of any Tax Revenues by the Agency if the City experiences significant 
losses in its Investment Pool. See also “RISK FACTORS – Certain Bankruptcy Risks” herein. 

58 

 

 

Certain Bankruptcy Risks 

The enforceability of the rights and remedies of the owners of the Bonds and the obligations of the 
Agency  may  become  subject  to  the  federal  bankruptcy  code  and  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency, 
reorganization,  moratorium,  or  similar  laws  relating  to  or  affecting  the  enforcement  of  creditors’  rights 
generally, now or hereafter in effect; usual equitable principles which may limit the specific enforcement under 
state law of certain remedies; the exercise by the United States of America of the powers delegated to it by the 
federal Constitution; and the reasonable and necessary exercise, in certain exceptional situations of the police 
power  inherent  in  the  sovereignty  of  the  State  and  its  governmental  bodies  in  the  interest  of  servicing  a 
significant and legitimate public purpose.  Bankruptcy proceedings, or the exercise of powers by the federal or 
state government, if initiated, could subject the owners of the Bonds to judicial discretion and interpretation of 
their rights in bankruptcy or otherwise and consequently may entail risks of delay, limitation, or modification 
of their rights. A delay would increase the likelihood of a delay or default in payment of the principal of and 
interest on the Bonds and the possibility of delinquent tax installments not being paid in full. 

Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund 

Redevelopment  agencies  were  required  to  shift  $135  million  of  tax  increment  revenues  to  the 
Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (“ERAF”) for Fiscal Year 2003-04 due to a shortfall in the State 
budget  for  Fiscal  Year  2003-04.  The  shift  to  ERAF  offset  the  need  for  a  similar  amount  of  State  aid  to 
education.  Legislation required that half of the shift be calculated on the basis of Fiscal Year 2001-02 gross 
tax increment of a project area and the other half on net revenues after tax–sharing payments.  The Agency’s 
portion  of  the  ERAF  requirement  for  Fiscal  Year  2003-04  was  $2,647,000,  of  which  the  Redevelopment 
Project Areas obligation totaled $149,000.  The adopted State budget for Fiscal Year 2004-05 included a $250 
million multi–year ERAF shift, limited to Fiscal Years 2004-05 and 2005-06, to be imposed on redevelopment 
agencies. The Agency’s portion of the ERAF requirement for Fiscal Year 2004-05 was $5,395,000, of which 
the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  obligation  totaled  $306,000.    The  Agency’s  portion  of  the  ERAF 
requirement  for  Fiscal  Year  2005-06  was  approximately  $6,059,000,  of  which  the  Redevelopment  Project 
Areas  obligation  totaled  $289,000.    The  Agency  is  not  able  to  predict  whether  legislation  requiring  ERAF 
payments or a shift of other payments which would adversely affect Tax Revenues will be enacted in future 
years.  

Pursuant to Senate Bill 1045, adopted in connection with the approval of the State Budget for Fiscal 
Year 2003-04, redevelopment agencies are permitted to extend the effective date of their redevelopment plans 
and the date to receive tax increment revenues by one year.  The Agency is expecting to extend each of the 
Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area and the Southcrest Redevelopment Project Area plan time limits by 
one year.  ERAF payments are not included in the maximum amount of tax increment the Agency may receive 
from  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  pursuant  to  the  related  Redevelopment  Plan.  See  “TAX 
ALLOCATION FINANCING AND LIMITATIONS ON TAX REVENUES – Plan Limitations” herein. 

Pursuant to Senate Bill 1096, adopted in connection with the approval of the State Budget for Fiscal 
Year 2004-05, redevelopment agencies are permitted to extend the effective date of their redevelopment plans 
and the date to receive tax increment revenues by one year for each of the two payments required.  A one year 
extension  is  authorized  for  each  payment  made  for  project  areas  that  have  less  than  10  years  of  plan 
effectiveness remaining from the last day of the fiscal year in which such a payment is made.  A one year 
extension is authorized for each payment made for project areas that have for project areas that have more than 
10 years and less than 20 years of plan effectiveness remaining from the last day of the fiscal year in which 
such a payment is made if the City Council can make certain findings that the Agency is in compliance with 
specified state housing requirements.  For those areas with more than 20 years of plan effectiveness remaining 
from  the  last  day  of  the  fiscal  year  in  which  a  payment  is  made,  no  extension  of  time  is  authorized.    The 
Agency is expecting to extend the Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area plan time limits by two years. 

59 

 

 

Risk of Earthquake and Other Disasters 

The State, including the City, is subject to periodic earthquake activity.  There are several faults in and 
near the San Diego area that pose earthquake hazards to the Redevelopment Project Areas. The Rose Canyon 
fault zone extends from La Jolla to San Diego Bay and is considered capable of producing a large, damaging 
earthquake.  Several active strands of the Rose Canyon fault have been discovered in downtown San Diego.  
An “active” fault is a fault that has moved within the past 10,000 years or so, and is considered capable of 
renewed movement.  The City requires geologic studies to investigate possible faulting prior to issuance of 
Building Permits.  More distant potential sources of damaging earthquakes are located about 10 miles offshore 
(Coronado  Bank  fault)  and  about  25  miles  northeast  of  the  City  (Elsinore  Fault).  Historically,  coastal  San 
Diego has experienced some earthquake damage as a result of distant earthquakes.  The City of San Diego is 
assigned to Seismic Zone 4, which is the same seismic zone assigned to Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Also, 
the City is located in an area that can be subject to tsunamis, other natural or man-made disasters or "acts of 
God"  that  could  cause  significant  damage  to  taxable  property  with  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas.  
Earthquake  faults  and  other  natural  conditions    may  change  over  time,  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of 
disasters.  

If an earthquake or other disaster were to substantially damage or destroy taxable property within the 
Redevelopment Project Areas, the assessed valuation of such property could be reduced.  There is no assurance 
that property owners within the Redevelopment Project Areas maintain earthquake or disaster  insurance or 
that any such insurance would be sufficient in the event of an earthquake.  Further, there is no assurance that 
federal,  State  or  other  emergency  funds  will  be  provided  or  would  be  sufficient  for  reconstruction  in  the 
Redevelopment  Project  Areas  in  the  event  of  an  earthquake  or  other  disaster.  A  reduction  of  assessed 
valuations  in  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  could  result  in  a  reduction  of  Tax  Revenues,  which  could 
impair the ability of the Agency to make payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds when due. 

Hazardous Substances 

Owners and operators of real property may be required by law to remedy conditions of the property 
relating to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances.  The federal Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, sometimes referred to as “CERCLA” or “Superfund Act,” 
is  the  most  well  known  and  widely applicable  of these  laws.  In  addition, California  laws impose particular 
requirements  with  regard  to  hazardous  substances.  Under  many  of  these  laws,  the  owner  (or  operator)  is 
obligated to remedy a hazardous substances condition of property whether or not the owner (or operator) has 
anything to do with creating or handling the hazardous substance. Further, such liabilities may arise not simply 
from the existence of a hazardous substance but from the method of handling it. All of these possibilities could 
significantly affect the financial and legal ability of a property owner or operator in the Redevelopment Project 
Areas to develop the affected property or other adjacent property and the value of such property. 

Property Tax Payment Delinquencies 

The County has offered an alternative method of tax apportionment pursuant to Section 4701 of the 
Revenue  and  Taxation  Code  of  the  State,  known  as  the  “Teeter  Plan,”  to  all  taxing  agencies,  districts, 
redevelopment agencies and non–county treasury legal depositories in the County. The Agency has elected not 
to participate in the Teeter Plan. Thus, there is no guaranty that the Agency will receive property tax payment 
delinquencies  in  the  Redevelopment  Project  Areas  in  the  future.  See  “TAX  ALLOCATION  FINANCING 
AND LIMITATIONS ON TAX REVENUES – Property Tax Collection Procedures” herein. 

Concentration of Ownership 

The  top  ten  property  owners  in  the  Southcrest  Redevelopment  Project  Area,  Central  Imperial 
Redevelopment Project Area and Mount Hope Redevelopment Project Area account for 19.00%, 38.68% and 
46.81%, respectively, of the total incremental assessed values for those Redevelopment Project Areas.  This 

60 

 

 

concentration of ownership presents a risk, in that failure of a large taxpayer or one or more of its tenants to 
pay property taxes when due could result in a delay in the timing of collection and in the amount of property 
taxes,  including  the  Tax  Revenues,  of  the  Redevelopment  Project  Area,  which  could  delay  or  imperil  the 
payment  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Loans,  and  could  thereby  result  in  delay  or  nonpayment  of  the 
Bonds.  See “Real Estate and General Economic Risk” for a description of general real estate and development 
risks. 

Change in Law 

No assurance can be given that the State electorate will not adopt initiatives or that the Legislature will 
not enact legislation that will amend the Constitution of the State, the Redevelopment Law or other laws in a 
manner that results in a reduction of Tax Revenues that could adversely affect the Agency’s ability to make 
payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.   

In  addition,  tax  legislation,  administrative  actions  taken  by  tax  authorities,  and  court  decisions, 
whether at the federal or state level, may adversely affect the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds under 
federal or state law and could affect the market price or marketability of the Bonds. 

Prospective purchasers should be aware that the United States Supreme Court has agreed to review 
Davis  v.  Dep’t.  of  Revenue  of  the  Finance  and  Admin.  Cabinet,  197  S.W.  3d  557  (Ky.  App.  2006),  cert. 
granted 2007 U.S. LEXIS  5914 (May 21, 2007), a decision of a Kentucky appellate court, which held that 
provisions of Kentucky tax law that provided more favorable income tax treatment for holders of bonds issued 
by  Kentucky  municipal  bond  issuers  than  for  holders  of  non-Kentucky  municipal  bonds  violated  the 
Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  State statutes provide more favorable State income tax 
treatment  for  holders  of  bonds  issued  by  State  and  its  political  subdivisions,  including  the  Bonds,  than  for 
bonds issued by other states and their political subdivisions.  If the United States Supreme Court were to affirm 
the  holding  of  the  Kentucky  appellate  court,  subsequent  State  judicial  decisions  or  legislation  designed  to 
ensure  the  constitutionality  of  State  tax  law  could,  among  other  alternatives,  adversely  affect  the  State  tax 
exemption of outstanding bonds, including the Bonds, to the extent constitutionally permissible, or result in the 
exemption  from  State  income  tax  of  interest  on  certain  bonds  issued  by  other  states  and  their  political 
subdivisions, either of which actions could affect the market price or marketability of the Bonds. 

Prospective  purchasers  of  the  Bonds  should consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding the  foregoing 

matters. 

CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS 

Certain legal matters incidental to the authorization, issuance and sale of the Bonds are subject to the 
approving  opinions  of  Robinson  &  Pearman  LLP,  Bond  Counsel.  The  proposed  form  of  opinion  of  Bond 
Counsel  is  attached  hereto  as  Appendix  E.    Certain  legal  matters  will  be  passed  upon  for  the  Agency  by 
Hawkins Delafield & Wood LLP,  Disclosure Counsel to the Agency, and by the City Attorney as Agency 
General  Counsel.    In  connection  with  the  issuance  of  the  Bonds,  the  fees  payable  to  Bond  Counsel  and 
Disclosure Counsel are contingent upon the issuance of the Bonds. 

VERIFICATION 

Upon  delivery  of  the  Bonds,  Grant  Thornton  LLP,  a  firm  of  independent  public  accountants,  will 
deliver  a  report  on  the  mathematical  accuracy  of  certain  computations  based  upon  certain  information  and 
assertions  provided  to  them  by  the  Underwriters  relating  to  (a)  the  adequacy  of  the  cash  and  the  maturing 
principal and interest on the government obligations in the Escrow Funds to pay all of the principal, interest 
and  redemption  premium  on  the  related  Refunded  Bonds  (see  “PLAN  OF  FINANCE”  herein)  and  (b)  the 
computations of  yield of  the  Series  B  Bonds  and  the federal  securities  in the  Escrow  Funds  which  support 

61 

 

 

Bond  Counsel’s  opinion  that  the  interest  on  the  Series  B  Bonds  is  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal 
income tax purposes. 

TAX MATTERS 

The  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986  (the  “Code”)  imposes  certain  requirements  that  must  be  met 
subsequent to the issuance and delivery of bonds, such as the Series A Bonds and the Series B Bonds, for 
interest thereon to be and remain excluded pursuant to section 103(a) of the Code from the gross income of the 
owners  thereof  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.    Noncompliance  with  such  requirements  could  cause  the 
interest on such bonds to be included in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes 
retroactive to the date of issuance of the bonds.  The Agency has indicated that no attempt will be made to 
comply with those requirements for the Series A Bonds and expects the interest on the Series A Bonds to be 
included  in  gross  income  pursuant  to  Section  103(a)  of  the  Code  (federally  taxable).    The  Agency  has, 
however, covenanted to maintain the exclusion of the interest on the Series B Bonds from the gross income of 
the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. 

In the opinion of Robinson & Pearman LLP, Bond Counsel, under existing law, interest on the Series 
A  Bonds  and  the  Series  B  Bonds  is  exempt  from  personal  income  taxes  of  the  State  of  California.    Bond 
Counsel is further of the opinion, assuming compliance with the aforementioned covenant, that interest on the 
Series B Bonds is excluded pursuant to section 103(a) of the Code from the gross income of the owners thereof 
for federal income tax purposes, that the Series B Bonds are not “specified private activity bonds” within the 
meaning of section 57(a)(5) of the Code and, therefore, the interest on the Series B Bonds will not be treated as 
an item of tax preference for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax imposed by section 55 of the 
Code.    The  receipt  or  accrual  of  interest  on  the  Series  B  Bonds  owned  by  a  corporation  may  affect  the 
computation of its alternative minimum taxable income, upon which the alternative minimum tax is imposed, 
to  the  extent  that  such  interest  is  taken  into  account  in  determining  the  adjusted  current  earnings  of  that 
corporation (75 percent of the excess, if any, of such adjusted current earnings over the alternative minimum 
taxable  income  being  an  adjustment  to  alternative  minimum  taxable  income  (determined  without  regard  to 
such adjustment or to the alternative tax net operating loss deduction)).  Bond Counsel expresses no opinion as 
to  the  exclusion  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  of  interest  on  the  Series  A  Bonds  or 
regarding any other federal tax consequence relating to the accrual or receipt of interest on the Series A Bonds 
or the Series B Bonds. 

Bond Counsel has not undertaken to advise in the future whether any events after the date of issuance 
of the Series A Bonds or the Series B Bonds may affect the tax status of interest on such bonds or the tax 
consequences  of  the  ownership  of  such  bonds.    No  assurance  can  be  given  that  future  legislation,  or 
amendments  to  the  Code,  if  enacted  into  law,  will  not  contain  provisions  that  could  directly  or  indirectly 
reduce the benefit of the exemption of interest on the Series A Bonds and the Series B Bonds from personal 
income taxation by the State of California or of the exclusion of the interest on the Series B Bonds from the 
gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes.  Furthermore, Bond Counsel expresses no 
opinion  as  to  any  federal,  State  or  local  tax  law  consequences  with  respect  to  the  Series  B  Bonds,  or  the 
interest thereon, if any action is taken with respect to the Series B Bonds or the proceeds thereof predicated or 
permitted upon the advice or approval of bond counsel if such advice or approval is given by counsel other 
than Bond Counsel. 

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Series B Bonds is excluded from the 
gross  income  of  the  owners  thereof  for  federal  income  tax  purposes,  an  owner’s  federal,  State  or  local  tax 
liability may be otherwise affected by the ownership or disposition of such bonds.  The nature and extent of 
these  other  tax  consequences  will  depend  upon  the  owner’s  other  items  of  income  or  deduction.    Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, prospective purchasers of the Series B Bonds should be aware that (a) 
section 265 of the Code denies a deduction for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or 
carry the Series B Bonds or, in the case of a financial institution, that portion of an owner’s interest expense 
allocated to interest on the Series B Bonds, (b) with respect to insurance companies subject to the tax imposed 

62 

 

 

by section 831 of the Code, section 832(b)(5)(B)(i) reduces the deduction for loss reserves by 15% of the sum 
of certain items, including interest on the Series B Bonds, (c) interest on the Series B Bonds earned by certain 
foreign corporations doing business in the United States could be subject to a branch profits tax imposed by 
section  884  of  the  Code,  (d)  passive  investment  income,  including  interest  on  the  Series  B  Bonds,  may  be 
subject to  federal  income  taxation  under  section 1375  of  the  Code  for  Subchapter  S  corporations  that  have 
Subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of the taxable year if greater than 25% of the gross receipts of 
such Subchapter S corporation is passive investment income, (e) section 86 of the Code requires recipients of 
certain  Social  Security  and  certain  Railroad  Retirement  benefits  to  take  into  account,  in  determining  the 
taxability of such benefits, receipts or accruals of interest on the Series B Bonds and (f) under section 32(i) of 
the Code, receipt of investment income, including interest on the Series B Bonds, may disqualify the recipient 
thereof from obtaining the earned income credit.  Bond Counsel has expressed no opinion regarding any such 
other tax consequences. 

Bond Counsel’s opinion is not a guarantee of a result, but represents its legal judgment based upon its 
review  of  existing  statutes,  regulations,  published  rulings  and  court  decisions  and  the  representations  and 
covenants of the Agency described above.  No ruling has been sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the 
“Service”) with respect to the Series B Bonds.  The Service has an ongoing program of auditing the tax-exempt 
status of the interest on municipal obligations.  If an audit of the Series B Bonds is commenced, under current 
procedures the Service is likely to treat the Agency as the “taxpayer,” and the owners of the Series B Bonds 
would  have no  right  to participate in  the  audit  process.    In  responding to  or defending  an  audit  of the  tax-
exempt status of the interest on the Series B Bonds, the Agency may have different or conflicting interest from 
the owners of the Series B Bonds.  Further, the disclosure of the initiation of an audit may adversely affect the 
market price of the Series B Bonds, regardless of the final disposition of the audit. 

LITIGATION 

There  is  no  action,  suit,  proceeding  or  investigation  at  law  or  in  equity  before  or  by  any  court  or 
governmental agency or body pending or, to the knowledge of the Agency, threatened against the Agency or 
the Authority to restrain or enjoin the authorization, execution or delivery of the Bonds or the pledge of the 
Pledged  Tax  Revenues  under  each  of  the  Loan  Agreements,  or  the  collection  of  the  payments  to  be  made 
pursuant to the Indentures, or in any way contesting or affecting the validity of the Bonds or the Indentures. 

RATINGS 

Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) have assigned their ratings 
of “Aa3,” and “AA,” respectively, to the Bonds based upon delivery of the Policy for the Taxable Bonds and 
the Policy for the Tax-Exempt Bonds by the Insurer.  Moody’s has assigned underlying ratings of “Baa2” to 
the Bonds.  On September 20, 2004, S&P suspended its uninsured ratings and underlying ratings on general 
obligation bonds, general fund–backed lease underlying ratings, all water and sewer revenue bond ratings, and 
all outstanding bonds and short–term notes of the City.  S&P’s ratings on the outstanding obligations of the 
Agency were also suspended at this time, including its obligations with respect to the Redevelopment Project 
Areas.  An explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained from the respective rating agencies. 
The  ratings  reflect  the  views  of  the  rating  agencies  and  the  Agency  makes  no  representation  as  to  the 
appropriateness  of  the  ratings.    Further,  there  is  no  assurance  that  such  ratings  will  continue  for  any  given 
period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn entirely if in the sole judgment of rating agencies 
circumstances so warrant.  Any such downward revision or withdrawal of a rating may have an adverse effect 
on the trading value and the market price of the Bonds.  Other than as provided in the Continuing Disclosure 
Certificates, the Agency undertakes no responsibility either to bring to the attention of the owners of the Bonds 
any downward revision or withdrawal of any rating obtained or to oppose any such revision or withdrawal.

UNDERWRITING 

The  Bonds  are  being  purchased  by  the  underwriters  listed  on  the  cover  page  hereof  (the 
“Underwriters”). RBC Capital Markets is the name under which RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. will be performing 
underwriting  services  in  connection  with  the  Bonds.  The  Underwriters  have  agreed,  subject  to  certain 
conditions, to purchase the Taxable Bonds from the Authority at a price of $17,132,995.10 (which represents 
the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Taxable  Bonds,  less  an  underwriters’  discount  of  $97,004.90).  The 
Underwriters have agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase the Tax-Exempt Bonds from the Authority 
at a price of $18,044,796.15 (which represents the aggregate principal amount of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, plus 
net original issue premium of $389,246.60, and less an underwriters’ discount of $99,450.45). The purchase 
agreement provides that the Underwriters will purchase all of the Bonds if any are purchased, the obligation to 
make such a purchase being subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the 
approval of certain legal matters by counsel and certain other conditions. The Underwriters may offer and sell 
the Bonds to certain dealers and others at prices lower than the offering price stated on the inside cover page. 
The offering prices may be changed from time to time by the Underwriters. 

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE 

The  Agency  has  covenanted  for  the  benefit  of  the  owners  of  the  Bonds  to  provide,  so  long  as  the 
Bonds are outstanding, the Annual Report setting forth certain financial information and operating data relating 
to the Agency by not later than 270 days following the end of the Agency’s Fiscal Year (which is currently 
June  30),  commencing  with  the  Annual  Report  for  the  2005-06  Fiscal  Year  and  to  provide  notices  of  the 
occurrences of certain enumerated events, if material.  These covenants have been made in order to assist the 
Underwriters in complying with the Rule.  The specific nature of the information to be contained in the Annual 
Report or the notices of material events by the Agency is set forth in the Continuing Disclosure Certificate for 
the Bonds. See APPENDIX F – “FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE CERTIFICATE” attached hereto. 

The Agency did file Annual Reports but did not provide financial statements with respect to Fiscal 
Years 2002-03 through 2005-06 for the outstanding obligations of the Agency identified in the following table, 
in  part,  because  the  City’s  financial  statements  were  not  available.    The  Agency  filed  notices  of  failure  to 
provide required annual financial information as required by its disclosure undertakings for Fiscal Years 2002-
03,  2003-04,  2004-05  and  2005-06.    Except  as  indicated  below,  the  Agency  has  otherwise  complied  in  all 
material respects in the last five years with each of its previous undertakings with regard to the Rule to provide 
Annual Reports or notices of material events in accordance with the Agency’s respective continuing disclosure 
undertakings.

1.1 

Report Overview 

Keyser Marston Associates, Inc. (KMA) has been retained as Fiscal Consultant to 

 
 
 
the Redevelopment Agency of the City of San Diego (Agency) to prepare a projection of tax 
increment revenues for the Mount Hope Project Area, Southcrest Project Area, and Central Imperial 
Project Area, as amended.  The Agency is proposing to issue bonds to be secured by tax increment 
revenues from the Project Areas.   
 
 
The California Community Redevelopment Law (CRL) provides for the creation of a 
redevelopment corporation for the purpose of eliminating blight.  To achieve this purpose, the CRL, 
along with Article 16, Section 16 of the California Constitution, authorizes the Agency to receive that 
portion of property tax revenue generated from the increase of the current year project taxable 
values over the Base Year taxable values that existed at the time of the Project Areas adoption.  
This portion of property tax revenue is referred to as tax increment revenue.  The CRL provides that 
the tax increment revenue may be pledged by the Agency for the repayment of Agency 
indebtedness. 
 
 
the basis from which a multi-year tax increment revenue projection is created.  The projected 
taxable values and resulting tax increment revenues for the Project Areas are based on 
assumptions determined by a review of the taxable value history of the Project Areas; Agency 
identified developments recently completed, presently under construction or proposed for the 
Project Areas; and the property tax assessment and property tax apportionment procedures of San 
Diego County. 

This Fiscal Consultant Report will examine the Project Areas valuations that provide

1.3 

Cumulative Tax Increment Limits  

 

Each of the Project Areas has a cumulative gross tax increment revenue limit 

 
imposed by the respective Redevelopment Plans.  Once the cumulative allocation of gross tax 
increment revenues reaches the respective limits, no additional tax allocations are projected.  The 
future year gross tax increment revenues projected in this Report are subject to the cumulative tax 
increment limits and have been added to the amounts already received by the Agency (amount 
reported by the County Auditor-Controller through FY 2005-06).  Based upon the assumptions 
incorporated in the projection of tax increment revenues shown on Tables 6.1 through 6.3, the 
cumulative limits are projected to be reached prior to the last date of tax increment eligibility for the 
following Project Areas, as summarized below:

The anticipation of reaching the respective cumulative revenue limits is subject to 
factors that go beyond the assumptions incorporated in the attached projections.  Future valuation 
growth was limited to growth resulting from a 2% inflationary increase (Proposition 13) on Real 
Property value plus site specific new developments identified by Agency staff.  Future valuation 
increases will be subject to local real estate market fluctuations that the County Assessor will 
consider when valuing future new development or transfer of ownership activities.  The resulting 
Project Area values reported by the County will therefore result in the Agency reaching the 
cumulative revenue limits sooner or later than what KMA has projected at the present time.    

 2. 

REVIEW OF PROJECT TAXABLE VALUES 

2.1 

Real and Personal Property 

Real Property, as referred to in this Report, is defined to represent land and 

 
 
 
improvement assessed values.  Annual increases in the assessed value of Real Property are 
limited to an annual inflationary increase of up to 2%, as governed by Article XIIIA of the State 
Constitution.  Real Property values are also permitted to increase or decrease as a result of a 
property's change of ownership or new construction activity.  As discussed below, the assessed 
value of taxable property is subject to reduction under certain conditions.   
 
 
For FY 1995-96 and FY 1996-97, the County Assessor applied a 1.19% and 1.11% 
inflationary factor to Real Property values in the respective fiscal years to reflect the change in the

1994 and 1995 State Consumer Price Indices.  For FY 1997-98 and FY 1998-99, the County 
Assessor applied the maximum 2% inflationary factor.  For FY 1999-2000, the County Assessor 
applied a 1.85% inflationary factor and commencing with FY 2000-01, the maximum 2% inflationary 
factor was used each year until FY 2004-05 when the inflationary factor was again adjusted to 
1.867%.  For FY 2005-06 and FY 2006-07, the 2% inflation factor was used.  Therefore, for 
purposes of this analysis, a 2% Real Property inflationary factor will continue to be applied in 
subsequent fiscal years.  
 
 
The assessed value of Personal Property is not subject to the maximum 2% 
inflationary increase and is subject to annual appraisal, either upward or downward.  State 
assessed Non-Unitary properties assessed by the State Board of Equalization (SBE) also may be 
revalued annually and such assessments are not subject to the annual 2% inflation limitation of 
Article XIIIA. 
 
 
until FY 1996-97, have reflected the March 1st lien date.  Commencing with FY 1997-98, the 
property tax lien date has been changed to January 1.  Each property assessment is assigned a 
unique Assessor Parcel Number (APN) which correlates to assessment maps prepared by the 
County.  The corresponding assessed values for each parcel are then encoded to Tax Rate Areas 
(TRAs) which are geographic subareas with common distribution of taxes and which are contained 
within the Project Area boundaries.  There is 1 TRA in the Mount Hope Project Area, 1 TRA in the 
Southwest Project Area, and 3 TRAs in the Central Imperial Project Area. 

Each Project Area’s assessed values are prepared by the County Assessor and, 

 

 

2.2 

FY 2006-07 Assessed Values  

 
 
 
The County Auditor-Controller is responsible for the aggregation of the assessed 
values assigned by the Assessor for properties within the boundaries of the Project Areas.  This 
results in the reported total current year assessed value for each project area and becomes the 
basis for determining tax increment revenues due to the Agency for each project area.  The 
preliminary reported values for each of the project areas for FY 2006-07 are as follows:

Secured Property includes property on which any property tax levied by the County 

 
 
becomes a lien on that property.  Unsecured Property typically includes the value of tenant 
improvements, trade fixtures and personal property.  The taxes levied on Unsecured Property are 
levied at the previous year's Secured Property tax rate. 

 

 

 

2.3 

Historic Taxable Values 

Historic Project Area taxable values were reviewed by KMA.  The historic reported 

 
 
 
taxable values of the Project Area covering fiscal years 2002-03 to 2006-07, is shown on Tables 1.1 
through 1.3.  The values are reported by the San Diego County Auditor-Controller.   
 
 
The Mount Hope Project Area values of Table 1.1 reflect an overall average annual 
increase of 7.5% for the period.  The secured taxable values, representing 85% of the Mount Hope 
Project Area’s reported value for FY 2006-07, increased an average of 7.4% per year over the 
same period.  The year to year changes in total Mount Hope Project Area value ranged from a high 
of 11.5% in FY 2005-06 to a low of -2.5% in 2003-04.1 
 
 
increase of 23.2% for the period.  The secured taxable values, representing 98.8% of the 
Southcrest Project Area’s reported value for FY 2006-07, increased an average of 24.4% per year 
over the same period.  The year to year changes in total Southcrest Project Area value ranged from 
a high of 26.2% in FY 2005-06 to a low of 7.4% in 2003-04. 
 

The Southcrest Project Area values of Table 1.2 reflect an overall average annual 

                     
1 This decline was the result of new exemption filings on nine secured parcels assessed to two qualifying non-profit 
owners: IG Partners and the San Diego Urban League.

The Central Imperial Project Area values of Table 1.3 reflect an overall average 
annual increase of 23.9% for the period.  The secured taxable values, representing 95.5% of the 
Central Imperial Project Area’s reported value for FY 2006-07, increased an average of 22.9% per 
year over the same period.  The year to year changes in the total Central Imperial Project Area 
value ranged from a high of 21.3% in FY 2002-03 to a low of 10.3% in 2006-07.

Values by Property Use  

 
 
 
Based upon a review of the FY 2006-07 values for each of the Project Areas, a 
distribution of values by property use was prepared for each Project Area and summarized on 
Table 2.1 through 2.3.  The summary Tables identify the amount of reported assessed value is 
represented by residential, commercial, industrial and other uses in each of the Project Areas.   
 
 
The Mount Hope Project Area land uses by assessed value (Table 2.1) indicates 
that 47.2% of the property values are related to residential uses, 16.5% of the property values are 
related to industrial uses and 20.4% of the property values are related to commercial uses.  
Unsecured and other miscellaneous land use values comprise 15.8% of the total reported value. 
 
 
88% of the property values are related to residential uses and 10.7% of the property values are 
related to commercial uses.  Unsecured and other miscellaneous land use values comprise 1.3% of 
the total reported value. 
 
 
that 59.3% of the property values are related to residential uses, 5.4% of the property values are 
related to industrial uses and 30.6% of the property values are related to commercial uses.  
Unsecured and other miscellaneous land use values comprise 4.7% of the total reported value.

Ten Largest Tax Payers  

The ten largest property owners in each of the Project Areas were identified by KMA 

 
 
 
based upon a review of the FY 2006-07 locally assessed secured and unsecured taxable 
valuations reported by the County Assessor.  The aggregated total assessed value of the identified 
ten largest tax payers is shown on Tables 3.1 through 3.3 and includes the assessee name, 
property use, parcel count, assessed value, percentage share of each of the Project Areas value, 
and percentage share of the total and incremental assessed values.   
 
 
aggregated total assessed value of $63,358,234 or 41.3% of the total reported value.  When 
expressed as a percentage of incremental assessed value, the ten largest tax payer values 
represent 46.8% of the incremental assessed value.   
 
 
aggregated total assessed value of $35,739,619 or 15.3% of the total reported value.  When

expressed as a percentage of incremental assessed value, the ten largest tax payer values 
represent 19% of the incremental assessed value. 
 
 
The ten largest taxpayers in the combined Central Imperial Project Area (Table 3.3) 
represent an aggregated total assessed value of $79,100,472 or 27.6% of the total reported value.  
When expressed as a percentage of incremental assessed value, the ten largest tax payer values 
represent 38.6% of the incremental assessed value. 

 

 

2.6 

Assessment Appeals 

Property taxable values determined by the County Assessor may be subject to an 

 
 
 
appeal by the property owner.  Assessment appeals are annually filed with the County Assessment 
Appeals Board for a hearing and resolution.  The resolution of an appeal may result in a reduction 
to the Assessor's original taxable value and a tax refund to the property owner.  The reduction in 
future Project Areas taxable values and the refund of taxes affects all taxing entities, including the 
Agency. 
 
 
the Project Areas based upon the latest information available from the County Appeals Board 
database.  From this research, KMA identified no assessment filings for FY 2006-07.  A 
comparative extraction of FY 2005-06 assessment appeal filings resulted in a total of 6 appeal 
filings in the previous year, of which 5 were withdrawn by the applicants and 1 resolved with no 
change in value. Therefore, for purposes of this tax increment projection, no adjustments have been 
made for future year tax refunds due to appeals.  
 

KMA researched the status of assessment appeals filed by property owners in all

TAX ALLOCATION AND DISBURSEMENT 

 

3.1 

Tax Rates 

Tax increment revenues projected in this analysis are computed based upon the 

 
 
 
annual incremental assessed value of each Project Area multiplied by a tax rate determined by the 
County Auditor-Controller.  The tax rate consists of the general tax levy of $1.00 per $100 of 
assessed value and the override tax rate which represents the debt service levy whose 
indebtedness has been authorized by voter approval.  
 
 
The override tax rates typically decline each year (1) as increasing property values 
reduce the override rate needed to be levied by the taxing entities to meet debt service, and (2) as 
voter approved debt is eventually retired over time.  An amendment to the Constitution prohibits 
redevelopment agencies from receiving taxes generated by new override tax rates, which are 
reflective of debt approved after December 31, 1988.  Therefore, for purposes of the tax increment 
projection, only the basic tax levy has been used to compute future tax increment.

3.2 

Allocation of Taxes 

 
 
 
Secured taxes are due in two equal installments.  Installments of taxes levied upon 
secured property become delinquent on December 10 and April 10.  Taxes on unsecured property 
are due March 1 and become delinquent August 31.   The County Auditor-Controller is responsible 
for the aggregation of the taxable values assigned by the Assessor as of the lien date for property 
within the boundaries of each Project Area.  This results in the reported total current year for each 
Project Areas taxable value and becomes the basis for determining tax increment revenues due to 
the Corporation.  Although adjustments to taxable values for property within each Project Area may 
occur throughout the fiscal year, such adjustments are not assumed in the tax increment projection 
prepared by KMA, except where noted. 
 
 
November.  Approximately 45% of the total tax increment revenues due to the Agency are allocated 
through January.  By the end of May, over 85% of the total Tax Increment Revenues are allocated 
to the Corporation, reflecting second installment collections.  Final reconciliation payments are 
generally made through August. 
 
 
 
 
collections received in each Project Area.  To estimate the percentage of unpaid taxes in each 
Project Area, a comparison of computed tax levy to actual tax receipts was conducted by KMA. 
This comparison, summarized on Tables 4.1 through 4.3, was reviewed for FY 2001-02 through FY 
2005-06.  The historic average receipts rates during this five-year period are as follows:  
 

The tax increment revenues are disbursed in eight monthly payments beginning in

Unitary Tax Revenue 

Commencing in 1988-89, the reporting of public utility values assessed by the SBE 

 
 
 
was modified pursuant to legislation enacted in 1986 (Chapter 1457) and 1987 (Chapter 921).  
Previously, property assessed by the SBE was assessed State-wide and was allocated according 
to the location of individual components of a utility in a TRA.  Hence, public utility values located 
within a redevelopment project area were fully reflected in each Project Area’s annual taxable 
value.  Since the County no longer included the taxable value of unitary properties as part of the 
reported taxable values in a redevelopment project, a base year reduction was made equal to the

amount of unitary taxable value that existed originally in the base year.  The values of most public 
utility properties are now assessed as a single unit on a County-wide basis (referred to as Unitary 
values).  Railroad properties and utility owned parcels not included by SBE in the Unitary 
assessment are referred to as Non-Unitary assessments.  
 
 
Unitary tax revenues are distributed by the County in the following manner:  (1) each 
taxing entity will receive the same amount as in the previous year plus an increase for inflation of up 
to 2%; (2) if utility tax revenues are insufficient to provide the same amount of revenue as in the 
previous year, allocation of the taxes would be reduced pro-rata County-wide; and (3) any increase 
in revenue above 2% would be allocated in the same proportion as the taxing entity's local secured 
taxable values are distributed to the local secured taxable values of the County.  The reported 
Unitary tax revenues for FY 2006-07 have been incorporated into the tax increment projections, as 
follows:  
 

Mount Hope 
Southcrest 
Central Imperial 

$7,661
$4,237

3.5 

Supplemental Assessments 

 

Supplemental assessments are authorized under Chapter 498 of the Statutes of 

 
 
 
1983, which provides that property may be reassessed upon the occurrence of a change of 
ownership or completion of new construction.  The supplemental assessment reflects the difference 
between the new value and old value.  Prior to the enactment of Chapter 498, property 
reassessments occurred only on the lien date next following the change in ownership or new 
construction.  The supplemental tax (if there is a resulting increase in value) or the supplemental 
refund (if there is a resulting decrease in value) is determined by applying the current year tax rate 
to the amount of supplemental assessment and prorating the resulting tax based upon the number 
of months remaining in the current fiscal year and, in certain instances, in the forthcoming fiscal 
year.2 
 
 
The tax revenues or refunds derived from supplemental assessments are allocated 
to redevelopment agencies on a monthly basis and incorporated in the tax payments prepared by 
the County Auditor-Controller.  Future new developments or property transfers occurring in the 
Project Area could likely result in supplemental tax revenues being allocated to the Corporation.  
However, due to their nature as one-time occurring revenues, supplemental taxes can be a 
relatively minimal revenue source to the Corporation.  In addition, pursuant to conversations with 
County Tax Collector staff, the receipt of supplemental taxes by the Agency can be delayed by as 
much as six to nine months after a property transfer or construction.  Therefore, for purposes of the 
current bond financing, KMA has not included any revenues resulting from future supplemental 
assessments in the tax increment projection. 

 

                     
2  Two  supplemental  assessments  would  occur  in  instances  where  a  change  in  ownership  or  a  new  construction 
occurs between the January 1 lien date and May 31st.

3.6 

County Administrative Fees 

 

Chapter 466, Statutes of 1990, (referred to as SB 2557) permits the County to 

 
 
withhold a portion of annual tax revenues for the recovery of County charges related to property tax 
administration services to cities in an amount equal to their property tax administration costs 
proportionately attributable to cities.  SB 2557, and subsequent legislation under SB 1559 (Statutes 
of 1992), permitted counties to charge all jurisdictions, including redevelopment agencies, on a year 
to year basis.  For FY 2005-06, the County debited the following charges, which represent the 
following percentages of gross revenue for that year:  
 

Mount Hope 
Southcrest 
Central Imperial 

$8,516
$10,978
$10,828

0.68% of gross 
0.80% of gross 
1.22% of gross 

 

 
 
The tax increment projections assume that the County will continue to charge the 
Agency for property tax administration and that charges will continue to be applied in subsequent 
years at each respective rate.  
 

4. 

PROJECT AREA OBLIGATIONS 

4.1 

Low and Moderate Income Housing 

 

The CRL requires redevelopment agencies to annually set aside 20% of all tax 

 
 
increment revenues into a Low and Moderate Income Housing Set Aside Fund.  Under the CRL, 
the set aside requirement could be reduced or eliminated if the redevelopment Agency finds that (1) 
no need exists in the community to improve or increase the supply of low and moderate income 
housing; (2) that some stated percentage less than 20% of the tax increment is sufficient to meet 
the housing need; or (3) that other substantial efforts, including the obligation of funds from certain 
local, state or federal sources for low and moderate income housing, of equivalent impact are being 
provided for in the community.   

 
 

4.2 

Tax Sharing Agreements 

(cid:131) 

Southcrest Project Area 

 

The Agency is obligated to annually distribute tax increment revenues from the 

 
 
Southcrest Project Area pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 33676, affected taxing 
entities may elect and school districts shall elect to receive a portion of annual tax increment 
revenues resulting from the annual inflationary increase allowed under Proposition 13.  Based 
upon discussions with the County Auditor-Controller, this election was made by the County 
General Fund, the San Diego Unified School District and the San Diego Community College

District.  The distribution incorporated on Table 6.2 is based upon the FY 2006-07 tax sharing 
allocation estimated by the County Auditor-Controller amounting to $168,665.  Subsequent year 
distributions are assumed to increase by the 2% inflationary factor.

Central Imperial Original Area 

 

 

 

 

 

As shown on Table 6.3, the Agency is obligated to annually distribute tax 

 
 
increment revenues from the Central Imperial Original Area to the County Office of Education, 
San Diego Unified School District, and the San Diego Community College District pursuant to 
tax sharing agreements with the respective taxing entities.  These tax sharing obligations are 
subordinate to all Agency bonded indebtedness. The projected fiscal impacts of these 
agreements are incorporated in the tax increment projection.  A brief description of the annual 
tax sharing allocations provided under the respective agreements is summarized below:

Statutory Pass Through Allocations 

(cid:131) 

Southcrest and Mount Hope  

 

The projections include statutory pass through obligations triggered by the 

 
 
Corporation’s adoption of Ordinances 19484 and 19417, to eliminate the debt incurrence time 
limit for the Southcrest and Mount Hope Project Areas, pursuant to SB 211.  The statutory pass 
through obligations (set forth under Health and Safety Code Section 33607.7) commence the 
first year following the fiscal year in which the repealed debt incurrence time limit would have 
taken effect without the Summary Ordinance and continue, for purposes of this projection, for as 
along as the Agency is eligible to receive tax increment revenues from the Southcrest and 
Mount Hope Project Areas.  Taxing agencies that do not have existing pass through 
agreements are eligible to receive their allocation of the resulting statutory pass through.   
 

(cid:131) 

Central Imperial Amendment No. 2 and No. 3 

 

Central Imperial Amendment No. 2 and No. 3 are subject to the statutory pass 

 
 
through requirements of AB 1290 which provides for specific formulas for payments to be made by 
the Agency to affected taxing entities as follows:  (1) from the first fiscal year in which the Agency 
receives tax increment until the last fiscal year in which the Agency receives the tax increment, 25% 
of the tax increments are passed through to the entities (net of the 20% Housing set aside); (2) 
commencing in the eleventh year, an additional 21% of the tax increment in excess of the tenth 
year tax increment is passed through to the entities (net of the 20% housing set aside); and (3) 
commencing in the thirty first year, an additional 14% of the tax increment in excess of the thirtieth 
year tax increment is passed through to the entities (net of the 20% housing set aside).

TAX INCREMENT REVENUE PROJECTION 

 

 

5.1 

Tax Increment Revenues 

Property tax revenues in excess of the amount resulting from the valuation 

 
 
 
shown on the assessment roll for the base year of each of the Project Areas is referred to as tax 
increment.  The base year for each of the Project Areas represents the fiscal year in which 
taxable property was last equalized prior to the effective date of the ordinance approving each 
Project Area's Redevelopment Plan. 
 
 
based upon the FY 2006-07 incremental assessed values reported by the County Auditor-
Controller.  The application of the Proposition 13 inflationary increase to Real Property values, 
plus any anticipated values added from new developments identified by Agency staff, results in 
the estimate of future Project Area values.   

The projections of tax increment revenues shown on Tables 6.1 through 6.3 are 

5.2 

New Development Value Added 

 

The new developments identified by Agency staff included projects recently 

 
 
completed, but whose taxable values are not reflected on the tax roll; projects currently under 
construction and projects soon to be built on specific sites in each of the Project Areas within 
the coming two years.  Speculative projects without Agency identified construction 
commencement date have not been included in our analysis.

5.3 

Trended Taxable Value Growth 

The tax increment revenue projections are summarized on Tables 6.1 through 

 
 
 
6.3 commencing with the reported values in FY 2006-07.  Each projection incorporates the 
valuation assumptions previously discussed in this Report.  Each projection is separated into 
Real Property and Personal Property values.  The projected growth in Real Property taxable 
values has been limited to anticipated value added from the identified new developments 
discussed above, and the maximum annual inflationary factor allowed under Proposition 13.   
 
 
Each projection assumes that future inflationary growth commencing in FY 2007-
08 will be at least 2% per year.  Future Personal Property values are assumed to stabilize at the 
previous year level.  Net tax increment revenue represents the Gross tax increment revenue 
and Unitary tax revenues less statutory pass through payments, pass through agreement 
allocations, County administrative fees authorized under SB 2557 and Housing Set Aside. 

 

5.4 

Caveats 

 

The projection reflects KMA's understanding of the assessment and tax 

 
 
apportionment procedures employed by the County.  The County procedures are subject to 
change as a reflection of policy revisions or legislative mandate.  While we believe our 
estimates to be reasonable, taxable values resulting from actual appraisals may vary from the 
amounts assumed in the projections.  Assumptions have also been made that Unitary tax 
revenues will continue to be allocated in the manner discussed herein and that legislatively-
mandated payments to the State will not be required in future fiscal years.  These assumptions 
reflect existing State policies and are subject to future legislative changes. 
 
 
increment revenues shown on Tables 6.1 through 6.4.  Actual revenues may be higher or lower 
than what has been projected and are subject to valuation changes resulting from new 
developments or transfers of ownership not specifically identified herein, actual resolution of 
outstanding appeals, future filing of appeals, or the non-payment of taxes due.   

No assurances are provided by KMA as to the certainty of the projected tax

APPENDIX B 

CERTAIN ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC DATA CONCERNING THE 

CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO 

Set forth below is certain demographic information regarding the City of San Diego (the “City”) 
and the County of San Diego (the “County”). This information is provided for informational purposes only. 
The  Bonds  (as  defined  in  the  Official  Statement)  are  not  a  debt  of  the  City,  the  County,  the  State  of 
California (the “State”), or any of its political subdivisions, and neither the City, County, the State nor any 
of  its  political  subdivisions  is  liable  thereon.  The  Bonds  are  not  payable  from  any  funds  of  the  City, 
including amounts in the City’s General Fund, and Tax Revenues (as defined in the Official Statement) are 
not impacted by the financial condition of the City. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS” in the Official 
Statement. 

Introduction 

The City of San Diego (the “City”), with a total population of approximately 1.3 million in 2007 and a 
land area of approximately 340 square miles, is the eighth largest city in the nation and the second largest city 
in California.  The City is the county seat for the County of San Diego (the “County”).  The City’s population 
increased by approximately 11.9% between 1998 and 2007, with an average annual increase of approximately 
15,549, based on estimates published by the California Department of Finance in May 2007.  In addition to 
having a favorable climate, the City offers a wide range of cultural and recreational services to both residents 
and  visitors.  The  City  has  a  diversified  economy.  Major  components  of  this  diversified  economy  include 
international  trade,  high–tech  manufacturing  and  research,  professional  services,  tourism  and  defense.    The 
City has historically benefited from manufacturing (ship building, industrial machinery, television and video 
equipment,  and  printing  and  publishing),  public  and  private  higher  education,  health  services,  military,  and 
local government employment.

equal the principal of the Bonds coming due and payable on such Interest Payment Date pursuant to 
the Indenture, or the redemption price of the Bonds (consisting of the principal amount thereof and 
any  applicable  redemption  premiums)  required  to  be  redeemed  on  such  Interest  Payment  Date 
pursuant to the Indenture. All moneys in the Principal Account shall be used and withdrawn by the 
Trustee solely for the purpose of (i) paying the principal at maturity of the Bonds at the respective 
maturities  thereof;  (ii) paying  the  principal  of  the  Term  Bonds  upon  the  mandatory  sinking  fund 
redemption thereof pursuant to the Indenture; or (iii) paying the principal of and premium, if any, on 
any  Bonds  upon  the  redemption  thereof  pursuant  to  the  Indenture.  All  amounts  on  deposit  in  the 
Principal Account on the first day of any Bond Year, to the extent not required to pay the principal of 
any  Outstanding  Bonds  then  having  come  due  and  payable,  shall  be  withdrawn  therefrom  and 
transferred to the Agency to be used for any lawful purposes of the Agency. 

(c) Reserve Accounts. If on any date deposits are to be made pursuant to (a) and (b) above, 
and amounts on deposit in the Revenue Fund shall be insufficient to enable the Trustee to make such 
deposits,  the  Trustee  shall  withdraw  the  amount  of  such  insufficiency  from  the  applicable  Reserve 
Account  established  pursuant  to  the  applicable  Constituent  Loan  Agreements  and  transfer  such 
amount to the Revenue Fund, as described in the applicable Loan Agreement. 

Investments.  All moneys in any of the funds or accounts established with the Trustee pursuant to the 
Indenture shall be invested by the Trustee solely in Permitted Investments, as directed in writing by either the 
Authority or the Agency and filed with the Trustee at least two Business Days in advance of the making of 
such investments.  In the absence of any such direction from the Authority or the Agency, the Trustee shall 
invest  any  such  moneys  in  certain  Permitted  Investments  described  in  clause (e) of  the  definition  thereof.  
Obligations purchased as an investment of  moneys in any fund shall be deemed to be part of such fund or 
account. 

Subject  to  the  following  sentence,  Permitted  Investments  of  moneys  in  the  Reserve  Accounts  shall 
have a maturity of no greater than five years. If a Permitted Investment may be liquidated or “put” at a price 
equal to the yield to maturity of such Permitted Investment with or to the provider thereof or such other entity 
rated at least “Aa3” by Moody’s Investors Service, “AA-” by Standard and Poor’s and “AA-“ by Fitch Ratings 
at  least  semiannually  in  connection  with  the  Interest  Payment  Dates  on  the  Bonds,  then  such  Permitted 
Investment may, notwithstanding any other maturity limitation set forth herein or in the definition of Permitted 
Investments in the Indenture, have a maturity of more than five years.  The Authority shall not enter into any 
such liquidation or “put” agreement if such liquidation or “put” agreement would result in the ratings then in 
effect on the Bonds being lowered. 

All interest or gain derived from the investment of amounts in any of the funds or accounts established 
hereunder shall be deposited in the fund or account from which such investment was made.  For purposes of 
acquiring any investments hereunder, the Trustee may commingle funds held by it hereunder as directed by 
either the Authority or the Agency.  The Trustee may act as sponsor, advisor, depository, principal or agent in 
the acquisition or disposition of any investment.  The Trustee shall incur no liability for losses arising from any 
investments made pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture.  The Authority acknowledges that regulations of 
the Comptroller of the Currency grant the Authority the right to receive brokerage confirmations of security 

C-11 

transactions to be effected by the Trustee hereunder as they occur.  The Authority specifically waives the right 
to receive such notification to the extent permitted by applicable law and agrees that it will instead receive 
periodic  cash  transaction  statements  which  include  detail  for  the  investment  transactions  effected  by  the 
Trustee hereunder; provided, however, that the Authority retains its right to receive brokerage confirmation on 
any investment transaction requested by the Authority. 

Valuation and Disposition of Investments. For the purpose of determining the amount in any fund or 
account, the value of Permitted Investments credited to such fund shall be valued, at least semiannually, at the 
market  value  thereof  (excluding  any  accrued  interest).  In  making  any  valuation  of  Permitted  Investments 
hereunder,  the  Trustee  may  utilize  computerized  securities  pricing  services  that  may  be  available  to  it, 
including those available through its regular accounting system and rely thereon. 

Certain additional Covenants 

Punctual Payments. The Authority shall punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal, interest and 
premium, if any, to become due in respect of all the Bonds, in strict conformity with the terms of the Bonds 
and the applicable Indenture, but only out of Revenues and other assets pledged for such payment as provided 
in the Indenture. 

Extension of Payment of Bonds. The Authority shall not directly or indirectly extend or assent to the 
extension  of  the  maturity  of  any  of  the  Bonds  or  the  time  of  payment  of  any  claims  for  interest  by  the 
purchaser of such Bonds or by any other arrangement, and in case the maturity of any of the Bonds or the time 
of payment of any such claims for interest shall be extended, such Bonds or claims for interest shall be subject 
to the prior payment in full of the principal of all of the Bonds then Outstanding and of all claims for interest 
thereon which shall not have been so extended.  Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit the right of 
the Authority to issue Bonds for the purpose of refunding any Outstanding Bonds, and such issuance shall not 
be deemed to constitute an extension of maturity of the Bonds. 

Against  Encumbrances.  The  Authority  shall  not  create,  or  permit  the  creation  of,  any  pledge,  lien, 
charge  or  other  encumbrance  upon  the  Revenues  and  other  assets  pledged  or  assigned  under  the  Indenture 
while any of the Bonds are Outstanding, except the pledge and assignment created by the Indenture. Subject to 
this limitation, the Authority expressly reserves the right to enter into one or more other indentures for any of 
its corporate purposes, including other programs under the Act, and reserves the right to issue other obligations 
for such purposes. 

Power to Issue Bonds and Make Pledge and Assignment. The Authority is duly authorized pursuant to 
law to issue the Bonds and to enter into the Indenture and to pledge and assign the Revenues, the Constituent 
Loan Agreements and other assets purported to be pledged and assigned, respectively, under the Indenture in 
the manner and to the extent provided in the Indenture.  The Bonds and the provisions of the Indenture are, and 
will be the legal, valid and binding special obligations of the Authority in accordance with their terms, and the 
Authority and the Trustee, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, shall at all times, to the extent permitted 
by law, defend, preserve and protect said pledge and assignment of Revenues and other assets and all the rights 
of the Bond Owners under the Indenture against all claims and demands of all persons whomsoever. 

Accounting Records and Financial Statement. The Trustee shall at all times keep, or cause to be kept, 
proper books of record and account, prepared in accordance with corporate trust industry standards, in which 
complete and accurate entries shall be made of all transactions made by the Trustee relating to the proceeds of 
the Bonds, the Revenues, the Constituent Loan Agreements and all funds and accounts established pursuant to 
the Indenture and the Loan Agreements.  Such books of record and account shall be available for inspection by 
the Authority and the Agency during regular business hours with reasonable prior notice. 

No  Additional  Obligations.    The  Authority  covenants  that  no  additional  bonds,  notes  or  other 
indebtedness shall be issued or incurred which are payable out of the Revenues in whole or in part.  Nothing in 

C-12 

this  section  shall  preclude  the  Agency  from  issuing  Parity  Debt  as  defined  under  the  Constituent  Loan 
Agreements in accordance with the provisions of the Constituent Loan Agreements. 

Constituent  Loan  Agreements.    The  Trustee,  as  assignee  of  the  Authority’s  rights  pursuant  to  the 
provisions  of  each  of  the  Loan  Agreements,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Indenture,  shall  promptly  use 
reasonable  efforts  to  collect  all  amounts  due  from  the  Agency  pursuant  to  the  applicable  Constituent  Loan 
Agreement and, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, shall diligently enforce, and take all steps, actions 
and proceedings reasonably necessary for the enforcement of all of the rights of the Authority under the Loan 
Agreements and for the enforcement of all of the obligations of the Agency under the Indenture. 

The Authority, the Trustee and the Agency may at any time amend or modify the Constituent Loan 
Agreements  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  applicable  Loan  Agreement,  (i) but  only  if  the  Trustee  first 
obtains the written consent of the Bond Insurer and the Owners of a majority of aggregate principal amount of 
the Bonds then Outstanding to such amendment or modification; or (ii) without the written consent of any of 
the Bond Owners but with the prior written consent of the Bond Insurer, if such amendment or modification is 
for any one or more of the following purposes: 

(a) to add to the covenants and agreements of the Agency contained in the Constituent Loan 
Agreements, other covenants and agreements thereafter to be observed, or to limit or surrender any 
rights  or  power  therein  reserved  to  or  conferred  upon  the  Agency  so  long  as  such  limitation  or 
surrender of such rights or powers shall not materially adversely affect the Owners of the Bonds; 

(b) to make such provisions for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, or of curing, correcting 
or supplementing any defective provision contained in the Constituent Loan Agreements, or in any 
other  respect  whatsoever  as  the  Agency  may  deem  necessary  or  desirable;  provided,  under  any 
circumstances,  that  such  modifications  or  amendments  shall  not  materially  adversely  affect  the 
interests of the Owners of the Bonds. 

The Authority shall notify the Bond Insurer and each rating agency rating the Bonds at the time of 
such  amendment  or  modification  of  such  amendment  or  modification  at  least  15 days  in  advance  of  the 
effective  date  of  such  amendment  or  modification,  by  giving  written  notice  with  a  copy  of  the  proposed 
amendment or modification included. 

No Arbitrage (2007 Series B Bonds).  The Authority shall not take, nor permit nor suffer to be taken 
by the Trustee, the Agency or otherwise, any action with respect to the proceeds of the 2007 Series B Bonds 
which,  if  such  action  had  been  reasonably  expected  to  have  been  taken,  or  had  been  deliberately  and 
intentionally taken, on the Closing Date would have caused the 2007 Series B Bonds to be “arbitrage bonds” 
within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code. 

Rebate of Excess Investment Earnings to Federal Government (2007 Series B Bonds).  The Authority 
hereby covenants to rebate excess investment earnings to the federal government in accordance with applicable 
requirements of Section 148(f) of the Code.  

Private Business Use Limitation (2007 Series B Bonds).  The Authority shall assure that: 

(a) not  more  than  10%  of  the  Proceeds  of  the  2007  Series  B  Bonds  is  used  for  Private 
Business Use if, in addition, the payment of the principal of, or the interest on, more than 10% of the 
Proceeds of the 2007 Series B Bonds is, under the terms of the 2007 Series B Bonds or any underlying 
arrangement directly or indirectly (i) secured by any interest in property, or payments in respect of 
property, used or to be used for a Private Business Use; or (ii) to be derived from payments, whether 
or not to the Authority, in respect of property or borrowed money used or to be used for a Private 
Business Use; and 

C-13 

(b) in the event that an amount in excess of 5% of the Proceeds of the 2007 Series B Bonds is 
used for a Private Business Use, and, in addition, the payment of the principal of, or the interest on, 
more than 5% of the Proceeds of the 2007 Series B Bonds during the term thereof is, under the terms 
of  the  2007  Series  B  Bonds  or  any  underlying  arrangement,  directly  or  indirectly  secured  by  any 
interest in property, or payments in respect of property, used or to be used for said Private Business 
Use  or  is  to  be  derived  from  payments,  whether  or  not  to  the  Authority,  in  respect  of  property  or 
borrowed money used or to be used for a Private Business Use, then, (i) said excess over 5% of the 
Proceeds of the 2007 Series B Bonds which is used for a Private Business Use shall be used for a 
Private  Business  Use  related  to  a  government  use  of  such  Proceeds;  and  (ii) each  such  Private 
Business Use over 5% of the Proceeds of the Bonds which is related to a government use of such 
Proceeds  shall  not  exceed  the  amount  of  such  Proceeds  which  is  used  for  the  government  use  of 
Proceeds to which such Private Business Use is related. 

Limitation on Use of Proceeds for Loan (2007 Series B Bonds).  The Authority shall assure that the 
Proceeds of the 2007 Series B Bonds are not used, directly or indirectly, to make loans to two or more ultimate 
borrowers  (including  governmental  units)  and  in  the  event  that  loans  are  made,  directly  or  indirectly,  to  a 
single  borrower  other  than  a  governmental  unit,  the  Authority  shall  assure  that  not  in  excess  of  5%  of  the 
Proceeds of the 2007 Series B Bonds is used for such purpose.  The provisions of this section do not apply to 
loans constituting Nonpurpose Investments or to loans which enable the borrower to finance any governmental 
tax or assessment of general application for specific essential governmental functions. 

Federal  Guarantee  Prohibition  (2007  Series  B  Bonds).    The  Authority  shall  not  take  any  action  or 
permit or suffer any action to be taken if the result of the same would be to cause any of the 2007 Series B 
Bonds to be “federally guaranteed” within the meaning of Section 149(b) of the Code. 

Modification and Amendment of the Indentures 
 

Amendment. Each Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Authority and of the owners of the 
Series of Bonds may be modified or amended at any time by a Supplemental Indenture which shall become 
binding upon adoption, without consent of any bond owners but with the prior written consent of the Bond 
Insurer, to the extent permitted by law but only for any one or more of the following purposes: 

 

(a) to add to the covenants and agreements of the Authority contained in the Indenture, other 
covenants  and  agreements  thereafter  to  be  observed,  or  to  limit  or  surrender  any  rights  or  powers 
herein  reserved  to  or  conferred  upon  the  Authority  so  long  as  such  limitation  or  surrender  of  such 
rights or powers shall not materially adversely affect the Owners of the Bonds; 
 

(b) to make such provisions for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, or of curing, correcting 
or  supplementing  any  defective  provision  contained  in  the  Indenture,  or  in  any  other  respect 
whatsoever as the Authority may deem necessary or desirable; provided that under any circumstances 
such modifications or amendments shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the Owners of 
the Bonds. 
 
Except  as  set  forth  in  the  preceding  paragraph,  the  Indenture  and  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the 
Authority and of the Owners of the Bonds may only be modified or amended at any time by a Supplemental 
Indenture  which  shall  become  binding  when  the  written  consent  of  the  Bond  Insurer  and  the  Owners  of  a 
majority  of  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Bonds  Outstanding  are  filed  with  the  Trustee.    No  such 
modification or amendment shall (i) extend the maturity of or reduce the interest or compounding rate on any 
Bond  or  otherwise  alter  or  impair  the  obligation  of  the  Authority  to  pay  the  principal,  and  interest  or 
redemption premiums at the time and place and at the rate and in the currency provided therein of any Bond 
without the express written consent of the Owner of such Bond; (ii) reduce the percentage of the aggregate 
principal  amount  of  the  Bonds  Outstanding  required  for  the  written  consent  to  any  such  amendment  or 
modification; or (iii) without its written consent thereto, modify any of the rights or obligations of the Trustee. 

C-14 

Events of Default and Remedies of Bond Owners 

Events of Default.  The following events shall be Events of Default under the Indenture: 

(a) Default  by  the  Authority  in  the  due  and  punctual  payment  of  the  principal  amount  or 
redemption  premium,  if  any,  of  any  Bond  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Indenture,  whether  at 
maturity as therein expressed, by proceedings for redemption, by declaration or otherwise; 

(b) Default by the Authority in the due and punctual payment of any installment of interest 

on any Bond pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture; 

(c) Default by the Authority in the observance of any of the other covenants, agreements or 
conditions on its part in the Indenture or in the Bonds contained, if such default shall have continued 
for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof, specifying such default and requiring the same to 
be  remedied,  shall  have  been  given  to  the  Authority  by  the  Trustee  or  the  Bond  Insurer,  or  to  the 
Authority and the Trustee by the Owners of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the 
Bonds Outstanding with the prior written consent of the Bond Insurer; provided that such default shall 
not constitute an Event of Default hereunder if, with the prior written consent of the Bond Insurer, the 
Authority shall commence to cure such default within said 30-day period and thereafter diligently and 
in good faith shall cure such default within a reasonable period of time; and 

(d) the filing by the Authority of a petition or answer seeking reorganization or arrangement 
under the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law of the United States of America, or if a 
court  of  competent  jurisdiction  shall  approve  a  petition,  filed  with  or  without  the  consent  of  the 
Authority, seeking reorganization under the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law of the 
United States of America, or if, under the provisions of any other law for the relief or aid of debtors, 
any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control of the Authority or of the whole or 
any substantial part of its property. 

Remedies and Rights of Bond Owners.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee may 
pursue any available remedy at law or in equity to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest and 
premium, if any, on the Outstanding Bonds, and to enforce any rights of the Trustee under or with respect to 
the Indenture. 

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and if the Trustee has been indemnified 
as provided in the Indenture, the Trustee shall, upon the request of the Owners of at least 25% in aggregate 
principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding, be obligated to exercise such one or more of the rights and powers 
conferred by the Indenture, as the Trustee, being advised by counsel, shall deem most expedient in the interests 
of the Bond Owners, provided however, if the Bond Insurer is not in default under the applicable Financial 
Guaranty Insurance Policy, the Bond Insurer, acting alone,  shall have to right to control such proceedings. 

No  remedy  conferred  upon  or  reserved  to  the  Trustee  or  the  Bond  Owners  by  the  terms  of  the 
Indenture is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but each and every such remedy shall be cumulative 
and shall be in addition to any other remedy given to the Trustee or the Bond Owners hereunder or now or 
hereafter existing at law or in equity. 

No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair 
any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or acquiescence 
therein; such right or power may be exercised from time to time as often as may be deemed expedient. 

Rights and Remedies of Bond Owners.  No Owner of any Bond issued hereunder shall have the right 
to institute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity, for any remedy under or upon the Indenture, 
unless (a) such Owner shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of the occurrence of an Event 

C-15 

of Default; (b) the Owners of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding shall have 
made a written request upon the Trustee to exercise the powers granted herein or to institute such action, suit 
or  proceeding  in  its  own  name;  (c) said  Owners  shall  have  tendered  to  the  Trustee  indemnity  reasonably 
acceptable  to  the  Trustee  against  the  costs,  expenses  and  liabilities  to  be  incurred  in  compliance  with  such 
request; and (d) the Trustee shall have refused or omitted to comply with such request for a period of 30 days 
after such written request shall have been received by, and said tender of indemnity shall have been made to, 
the Trustee, 

Such notification, request, tender of indemnity and refusal or omission are hereby declared, in every 
case, to be conditions precedent to the exercise by any Owner of Bonds of any remedy hereunder; it being 
understood and intended that no one or more Owners of Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatsoever, 
by his or their action, to enforce any right under the Indenture, except in the manner herein provided, and that 
all  proceedings  at  law  or  in  equity  to  enforce  any  provision  of  the  Indenture  shall  be  instituted,  held  and 
maintained in the manner herein provided and for the equal benefit of all Owners of the Outstanding Bonds. 

The right of any Owner of any Bond to receive payment of the principal of and interest and premium, 
if any, on such Bond as herein provided or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, shall not 
be impaired or affected without the written consent of such Owner, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions 
of the Indenture or any other provision of the Indenture. 

If the Bond Insurer is not in default under the Financial Guaranty Insurance Policy, notwithstanding 
any other provision of the Indenture, the Bond Insurer, acting alone, shall have the right to direct all remedies 
in  the  event  of  default  under  the  Indenture.    For  this  purpose,  the  Bond  Insurer  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the 
Owner of all of the Bonds and shall have the right to institute any suit, action, or proceeding at law or in equity 
under the same terms given to Bond Owners under the Indenture. 

Application of Revenues and Other Fund After Default. All amounts received by the Trustee pursuant 
to any right given or action taken by the Trustee under the provisions of the Indenture shall be applied by the 
Trustee in the following order, upon presentation of the several Bonds and the stamping thereon of the amount 
of the payment if only partially paid, or upon the surrender thereof if fully paid: 

First,  to  the  payment  of  the  fees,  costs  and  expenses  of  the  Trustee,  including  reasonable 
compensation to its agents, attorneys and counsel incurred in and about the performance of its powers 
and duties under this Indenture; and 

Second, to the payment of the whole amount of principal of and interest on, the Bonds then 
due and unpaid, with interest on overdue installments of principal and interest to the extent permitted 
by  law  at  the  rate  of  interest  then  borne by  the  Outstanding  Bonds; provided,  however,  that  in  the 
event such amounts shall be insufficient to pay in full the amount of such interest and principal, then 
such amounts shall be applied in the following order of priority: 

(a) to the payment of all installments of interest on the Bonds then due and unpaid, 
on  a  pro  rata  basis  in  the  event  that  the  available  amounts  are  insufficient  to  pay  all  such 
interest in full; 

(b) to the payment of principal of all installments of the Bonds then due and unpaid, 
on  a  pro  rata  basis  in  the  event  that  the  available  amounts  are  insufficient  to  pay  all  such 
principal in full; and 

(c) to the payment of interest on overdue installments of principal and interest, on a 
pro rata basis in the event that the available amounts are insufficient to pay all such interest in 
full. 

C-16 

Power of Trustee to Control Proceedings.  In the event that the Trustee, upon the happening of an 
Event  of  Default,  shall  have  taken  any  action,  by  judicial  proceedings  or  otherwise,  pursuant  to  its  duties 
hereunder, whether upon its own discretion or upon the request of the Owners of a majority of the aggregate 
principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding, it shall have full power (subject to the right of the Bond Insurer to 
control such proceedings), in the exercise of its discretion for the best interest of the Owners of the Bonds with 
respect  to  the  continuance,  discontinuance,  withdrawal,  compromise,  settlement  or  other  disposal  of  such 
action; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not, unless there no longer continues an Event of Default, 
discontinue, withdraw, compromise or settle, or otherwise dispose of any litigation pending at law or in equity, 
if at the time there has been filed with it a written request signed by the Owners of a majority of the aggregate 
principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding hereunder opposing such discontinuance, withdrawal, compromise, 
settlement or other disposal of such litigation.  Any suit, action or proceeding which any Owner of Bonds shall 
have the right to bring to enforce any right or remedy hereunder may be brought by the Trustee for the equal 
benefit and protection of all Owners of Bonds similarly situated and the Trustee is hereby appointed (and the 
successive  respective  Owners  of  the  Bonds  issued  hereunder,  by  taking  and  holding  the  same,  shall  be 
conclusively deemed so to have appointed it) the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the respective Owners of 
the Bonds for the purpose of bringing any such suit, action or proceeding and to do and perform any and all 
acts  and  things  for  and  on  behalf  of  the  respective  Owners  of  the  Bonds  as  a  class  or  classes,  as  may  be 
necessary or advisable in the opinion of the Trustee as such attorney-in-fact. 

Appointment  of  Receivers.    Upon  the  occurrence  of  an  Event  of  Default  hereunder,  and  upon  the 
filing of a suit or other commencement of judicial proceedings to enforce the rights of the Trustee and of the 
Bond Owners under the Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to the appointment of a 
receiver or receivers of the Revenues and other amounts pledged hereunder, pending such proceedings, with 
such powers as the court malting such appointment shall confer. 

Non-Waiver.  Nothing in the Indenture, or in the Bonds, shall affect or impair the obligation of the 
Authority,  which  is  absolute  and  unconditional,  to  pay  the  interest  on  and  principal  of  the  Bonds  to  the 
respective Owners of the Bonds at the respective dates of maturity, as herein provided, out of the Revenues 
and other moneys herein pledged for such payment. 

A waiver of any default or breach of duty or contract by the Trustee or any Bond Owner shall not 
affect  any  subsequent  default  or  breach  of  duty  or  contract,  or  impair  any  rights  or  remedies  on  any  such 
subsequent  default  or  breach.    No  delay  or  omission  of  the  Trustee  or  any  Owner  of  any  of  the  Bonds  to 
exercise  any  right  or  power  accruing  upon  any  default  shall  impair  any  such  right  or  power  or  shall  be 
construed  to  be  a  waiver  of  any  such  default  or  an  acquiescence  therein;  and  every  power  and  remedy 
conferred  upon  the  Trustee  or  Bond  Owners  by  the  Bond  Law  or  by  the  Indenture  may  be  enforced  and 
exercised from time to time and as often as shall be deemed expedient by the Trustee or the Bond Owners, as 
the case may be. 

Termination of Proceedings.  In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under the 
Indenture by the appointment of a receiver or otherwise, and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or 
abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely, then and in every such case, the Authority, 
the Trustee and the Bond Owners shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, 
with regard to the property subject to the Indenture, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee shall 
continue as if no such proceedings had been taken. 

Discharge of Indenture  

If the Authority shall pay and discharge any or all of the Outstanding Bonds in any one or more of the 

following ways: 

(a) by paying or causing to be paid the principal of and interest and premium, if any, on such 

Bonds, as and when the same become due and payable; 

C-17 

(b) by irrevocably depositing with the Trustee, in trust, at or before maturity, money which, 
together with the available amounts then on deposit in the funds and accounts established with the 
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture and the Constituent Loan Agreements, is fully sufficient to pay such 
Bonds, including all principal, interest and redemption premiums; or 

(c) by  complying  with  the  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Indenture and  by  irrevocably 
depositing  with  the  Trustee  or  any  other  fiduciary,  in  trust  in  an  escrow,  noncallable  Federal 
Securities,  including,  without  limitation,  State  and  Local  Government  Series  issued  by  the  United 
States  Treasury  (“SLGS”),  United  States  Treasury  bills,  notes  and  bonds,  as  traded  on  the  open 
market; and/or Zero Coupon Treasury Bonds (“STRIPS”), in such amount as an Independent Certified 
Public  Accountant  shall  determine  will,  together  with  the  interest  to  accrue  thereon  and  available 
moneys  then  on  deposit  in  the  funds  and  accounts  established  with  the  Trustee  pursuant  to  the 
Indenture  and  the  Constituent  Loan  Agreements,  be  fully  sufficient  to  pay  and  discharge  the 
indebtedness  on  such  Bonds  (including  all  principal,  interest  and  any  redemption  premiums)  at  or 
before their respective maturity dates; 

and if such Bonds are to be redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall have been 
mailed pursuant to the Indenture or provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made for the mailing 
of such notice and the provisions of the following paragraph have been complied with, then, at the Request of 
the Authority, and notwithstanding that any of such Bonds shall not have been surrendered for payment, the

consecutive days during which no petition in bankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code has been filed by or 
against  the  entity;  which  paid  such  money,  and  no  similar  proceedings  have  been  instituted  under  state 
insolvency  or  other  laws  affecting  creditors'  rights  generally,  or  (iii)    any  monies  with  respect  to  which  an 
unqualified  opinion  from  nationally  recognized  counsel  has  been  received  stating  that  such  payments  to 
bondholders  would  not  constitute  voidable  preferences  under  Section  547  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code,  or 
similar state or federal laws with voidable preference provisions in the event of the filing of a petition for relief 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or similar state or federal laws with voidable preference provisions by or 
against  the  entity  from  whom  the  money  is  received.    No  forward  delivery  agreements,  hedge,  investment 
agreement, purchase and resale agreements or par-put agreements may be used with respect to the investment 
of any funds or securities defeasing the Bonds without the prior written consent of the Bond Insurer. 

Additionally, the Authority and the Agency shall have the right to discharge any Outstanding Bond by 
purchasing  such  Bond  at  public  or  private  sale  as  and  when,  and  at  such  prices  (including  brokerage 
commissions)  not  in  excess  of  the  par  amount  thereof  plus  accrued  interest  thereon  to  the  date  of  such 
purchase, as the Authority or the Agency, as the case may be, in its sole discretion determine, and by tendering 
such Bond to the Trustee for cancellation.  Further, in lieu of depositing any or all of the cash with the Trustee

mailing of notice of redemption, a portion of the applicable Term Bonds in an amount less than or equal to the 
amount of such sinking fund redemption. 

Unclaimed Moneys. 

 
Anything in the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, any moneys held by the Trustee in trust for 
the payment and discharge of any of the Bonds (including without limitation moneys held for the payment of 
the principal of and interest on any of the Bonds) which remain unclaimed for two years after the date when 
such Bonds have become due and payable, either at their stated maturity dates or by call for earlier redemption, 
if such moneys were held by the Trustee at such date, or for two years after the date of deposit of such moneys 
if deposited with the Trustee after said date when such Bonds become due and payable, shall be repaid by the 
Trustee to the Agency, as its absolute property and free from trust, and the Trustee shall thereupon be released 
and discharged with respect thereto and the Bond Owners shall look only to the Agency for the payment of 
such  Bonds;  provided,  however,  that  before  being  required  to  make  any  such  payment  to  the  Agency,  the 
Trustee  shall,  at  the  expense  of  the  Agency,  cause  to  be  mailed  to  the  Owners  of  all  such  Bonds,  at  their 
respective  addresses  appearing on  the Registration  Books, a notice that  said  moneys  remain  unclaimed  and 
that, after a date named in said notice, which date shall not be less than 30 days after the date of mailing of

The Agency has made the following covenants under the Agreement. 

Other Covenants of the Agency 
 
 
 
Punctual Payment.  The Agency will punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal and Accreted 
 
Value of and interest on the Bonds together with any prepayment premiums, if applicable, thereon in strict 
conformity with the terms of the Agreement and the applicable Supplemental Trust Agreements, and it will

the applicable Supplemental Trust Agreements. 
 
Limitation on Superior Debt.  The Agency covenants that, so long as the Bonds remain unpaid, the 
 
Agency shall not issue any bonds, notes or other obligations, enter into any agreement or otherwise incur any 
Bonds, advances or indebtedness, which is in any case secured by a lien on all or any part of the Tax Revenues 
which is superior to or on a parity with the lien established hereunder, for the security of the Bonds, excepting 
only parity Bonds issued pursuant to Section 2.11 of the Trust Agreements.  The Agency covenants and agrees 
that it will take no action related to the expenditure of  Tax Revenues which would preclude the due and timely 
payment  of  principal  of,  Accreted  Value  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  and  that  it  will  comply  with  the 
requirements  of  Section  33675  of  the  Redevelopment  Law,  including  the  annual  filing  of  a  "statement  of 
indebtedness" with the Auditor-Controller of the County.  Nothing herein is intended or shall be construed in

debt. 
 
Payment of Claims.  The Agency will pay and discharge, or cause to be paid and discharged, any and 
 
all lawful claims for labor, materials or supplies which, if unpaid, might become a lien or charge upon the 
properties owned by the Agency or upon the Tax Revenues or any part of the Trust Agreement, or upon any 
funds in the hands of the Trustee, or which might impair the security of the Bonds.  Nothing herein contained 
shall  require  the  Agency  to  make  any  such  payment  so  long  as  the  Agency  in  good  faith  shall  contest  the 
validity of said claims. 
 
Books and Accounts; Financial Statement.  The Agency will keep or cause to be kept, proper books of 
 
record  and  accounts,  separate  from  all  other  records  and  accounts  of  the  Agency  and  the  City,  in  which

upon  prior  written  request,  to  the  reasonable  inspection  of  the  Trustee  and  the  Owners  of  any  Bonds  then 
Outstanding,  or  their  representatives  authorized  in  writing.    The  Trustee  shall  have  no  duty  to  review  such 
books of record and account.  The Agency will cause to be prepared and sent to the Trustee annually, within 
two  hundred  seventy  (270)  days  after  the  close  of  each  Fiscal  Year  so  long  as  any  of  the  Bonds  are

Revenues,  all  disbursements  from  the  Revenue  Funds  and  the  Redevelopment  Funds  and  the  financial 
condition  of  the  Redevelopment  Projects,  including  the  balances  in  all  funds  and  accounts  relating  to  the 
Redevelopment Projects, as the end of such Fiscal Year.  The Agency will furnish a copy of such statements, 
upon reasonable request, to any Bond Owner.  The Trustee shall have no duty to review such statements.

discharged,  all  taxes,  service  charges,  assessments  and other  governmental  charges  which  may  hereafter  be 
lawfully imposed upon the Agency or the properties then owned by the Agency in the Project Area, when the 
same shall become due.  Nothing herein contained shall require the Agency to make any such payment so long 
as the Agency in good faith shall contest the validity of said taxes, assessments or charges.  The Agency will

C-33 

duly  observe  and  conform  with  all  valid  requirements  of  any  governmental  authority  relative  to  the 
Redevelopment Project or any part thereof. 
 
Taxation of Leased Property.[Central Imperial Only]  Twenty percent (20%) of any amounts derived 
 
by the Agency pursuant to Section 33673 of the Redevelopment Law with respect to the lease of property for 
redevelopment shall be treated as Tax Revenues for all purposes of the Trust Agreement, and shall be paid to 
the Agency for deposit in the applicable Revenue Funds. 
 
Disposition of Property.  The Agency will not knowingly participate in the disposition of any land or 
 
real  property  in  the  Redevelopment  Project  Area  to  anyone  which  will  result  in  such  property  becoming 
exempt from taxation because of public ownership or use or otherwise (except property dedicated for public 
right-of-way and except property planned for public ownership or use by the Redevelopment Plan in effect on 
the  date  of  the  Trust  Agreement)  so  that  such  disposition  shall,  when  taken  together  with  other  such 
dispositions, aggregate more than ten percent (10%) of the land area in the Redevelopment Project Area unless 
such  disposition  is  permitted  as  hereinafter  provided.    If  the  Agency  proposes  to  participate  in  such  a 
disposition, it shall thereupon appoint an Independent Redevelopment Consultant to report on the effect of said 
proposed disposition.  If the report of the Independent Redevelopment Consultant concludes that the security 
of the Bonds and the rights of the Agency, the Bond Owners and the Trustee hereunder will not be (and are not 
currently)  materially  impaired  by  said  proposed  disposition  (i.e.,  Housing  Tax  Revenues  or  Project  Tax 
Revenue will not be below 150% [125% for Southcrest] of Maximum Annual Debt Service for Bonds payable 
from such Tax Revenues), the Agency may thereafter make such disposition.  If said Report concludes that 
such  security  will  be  materially  impaired  by  said  proposed  disposition,  the  Agency  shall  disapprove  said 
proposed disposition (or such security is already materially impaired), the Agency covenants and agrees that if 
all or more than five percent of the Redevelopment Project Area should be taken from it, by eminent domain 
proceedings or other proceedings authorized by law, for any public or other use under which the property will 
be  tax  exempt,  the  Agency  shall  use  its  best  efforts  to  adjust,  in  accordance  with  applicable  law,  the  tax 
increment base of the Redevelopment Project Area to reflect such taking(s). 
 
Maintenance of Tax Revenues.  The Agency shall comply with all requirements of the Redevelopment 
 
Law to ensure the allocation and payment to it of the Tax Revenues, including without limitation the timely 
filing of any necessary statements of indebtedness with appropriate officials of the County and (in the case of 
supplemental revenues and other amounts payable by the State) appropriate officials of the State.  The Agency 
shall  not  enter  into  any  agreement  or  any  amendment  of  any  agreement  with  the  County  or  any  other 
governmental  unit  which  would  have  the  effect  of  reducing  the  amount  of  Tax  Revenues  available  to  the 
Agency for payment of the Bonds (excluding taxes attributable to a tax rate levied by a taxing agency for the 
purpose  of  producing  revenues  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  make  annual  repayments  of  the  principal  of, 
Accreted Value, and the interest on, any bonded indebtedness of such taxing agency), unless the Agency shall 
first obtain the Report of an Independent Redevelopment Consultant stating that (i) the Housing Tax Revenues 
and the Project Tax Revenues estimated to be received in the current Fiscal Year and in each of the three (3) 
succeeding Fiscal Years shall be at least equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of Maximum Annual Debt 
Service  [one  hundred  twenty  five  percent  (125%)  for  Southcrest]  payable  from  said  Tax  Revenues    and 
(ii) thereafter  said  amendment  or  agreement  will  not  reduce  Housing  Tax  Revenues  and  the  Project  Tax 
Revenues below one hundred fifty percent (150%) of Maximum Annual Debt Service [one hundred twenty 
five percent (125%) for Southcrest] payable from said Tax Revenues. 
 
Payment of Expenses; Indemnification.  The Agency shall pay to the Trustee all compensation for all 
 
services rendered under the Trust Agreement and any Supplemental Trust Agreement within thirty (30) days of 
the  receipt  of  a  statement  therefor,  including  but  not  limited  to  all  reasonable  expenses,  charges,  legal  and 
consulting fees and other disbursements and those of its attorneys, agents and employees, incurred in and about 
the  performance  of  its  powers  and  duties  hereunder  and  thereunder.    Upon  the  occurrence  of  an  Event  of 
Default of the type described in Sections 8.01 (a), (b) or (c) of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall have a 
first lien on the Pledged Tax Revenues and the Reserve Funds to secure the payment to the Trustee, Registrar 
and Paying Agent of all fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable compensation to its experts, attorneys 

C-34 

and counsel incurred in declaring such Event of Default and in exercising the rights and remedies set forth in 
Article VIII of the Trust Agreement. 
 
 
The Agency further covenants and agrees to indemnify and save the Trustee and its officers, directors, 
agents and employees, harmless against any losses, expenses and liabilities which it may incur arising out of or 
in the exercise and performance of its powers and duties hereunder and under the Agreement, including the 
costs and expense (including the allocated cost of in-house counsel) of defending against any claim of liability, 
but  excluding  any  and  all  losses,  expenses  and  liabilities  which  are  due  to  the  negligence  or  intentional 
misconduct of the Trustee, its officers, directors, agents or employees.  The obligations of the Agency under 
the paragraph shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee under the Agreement and payment of the 
Bonds and the discharge of the Agreement. 
 
Redevelopment  of  Redevelopment  Project  Area.    The  Agency  shall  ensure  that  all  activities 
 
undertaken  by  the  Agency  with  respect  to  the  redevelopment  of  the  Redevelopment  Project  Area  are 
undertaken and accomplished in conformity with all applicable requirements of the Redevelopment Plan and 
the Redevelopment Law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agency covenants that it shall 
deposit  or  cause  to  be  deposited  in  the  Redevelopment  Fund  all  amounts  when,  as  and  if  required  to  be 
deposited therein pursuant to the Redevelopment Law.  The Redevelopment Plan may be amended as provided 
in the Redevelopment Law but, unless said amendment is agreed to in writing by the Insurer, if any, of all 
Outstanding Bonds, no amendment shall be made (i) which would cause, in the  Bond year following such 
amendment, Housing Tax Revenues or Project Tax Revenues to fall below 150% [125% for Southcrest] of 
Maximum  Annual  Debt  Service  payable  from  such  Tax  Revenues    or  (ii)  which  will  impair  the  Agency's 
ability to timely pay the principal of, Accreted Value and interest on the Bonds within the life of the Bonds 
within constraints imposed by the Tax Increment Limitation or otherwise, all as certified by the Independent 
Redevelopment Consultant.  The Agency further covenants and confirms to take any and all further actions 
necessary  to  enforce  the  lien  and  pledge  of  all  Tax  Revenues  lawfully  received  by  the  Agency  from  all 
properties within the Redevelopment Project Area for payment of principal of, Accreted Value and interest on 
the Bonds to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
 
Further  Assurances.    The  Agency  will  adopt,  make,  execute  and  deliver  any  and  all  such  further 
 
resolutions, instruments and assurances as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out the intention or 
to  facilitate  the  performance  of  the  Trust  Agreement  and  for  the  better  assuring  and  confirming  unto  the 
Trustee and the Owners of the Bonds of the rights and benefits provided in the Trust Agreement. 
 
Plan Limit.  The Agency covenants and agrees to annually review the total amount of Tax Revenues 
 
remaining  to  be  received  by  the  Agency  under  the  Tax  Increment  Limitation  without  deduction  for  any 
amounts reserved to taxing entities under Health and Safety Code Sections 33676, 33607.5 and 33607.7 or 
under  other  provisions  of  Law  and  to  annually  review  future  cumulative  Annual  Debt  Service  and  future 
cumulative payments reserved to taxing entities under Health and Safety Code Sections 33676, 33607.5 and 
33607.7 (or under other provisions of Law).  The Agency will not accept Tax Revenues or incur additional 
obligations  payable  from  Tax  Revenues,  if  such  acceptance  or  incurrence  will  cause  the  amount  remaining 
under the Tax Increment Limitation to fall below 110% of remaining aggregate cumulative debt service on all 
of the Bonds payable from Tax Revenues, estimated future aggregate payments reserved to the taxing entities 
under  Health  and  Safety  Code  Sections  33676,  33607.5  and  33607.7  or  under  other  provisions  of 
Redevelopment  Law  and  other  indebtedness  established  pursuant  to  Section 33333.2  of  the  Redevelopment 
Law,  except  for  the  purpose  of  depositing  such  revenues  in  escrow  for  future  debt  service  payments  with 
respect to such Bonds, payments to such taxing entities or other indebtedness. 
 
Additional Disclosure.  The Agency covenants and agrees to comply with the applicable provisions of 
 
Rule 15c2-12 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended with respect to continuing 
disclosure obligations of issuers of municipal obligations for so long as any Bonds issued under the Agreement 
are Outstanding. 
 

C-35 

Tax Exemption.  The Agency has covenanted under the Supplemental Trust Agreement for the tax-
 
exempt  Bonds  not  to  take,  or  permit  or  suffer  to  be  taken  by  the  Trustee,  any  action  with  respect  to  the 
proceeds of the tax exempt Bonds or the funds as accounts held therefor which will have the effect of causing 
the  interest  received  by  the  Holders  of  the  tax  exempt  Bonds  not  to  be  excludable  from  gross  income  for 
federal income tax purposes under the Code. 
 
Investments 
 
Moneys held by the Trustee in the funds and accounts created under the Agreement shall be invested 
 
and reinvested by the Trustee in Permitted Investments as directed by the Agency, subject to the restrictions set 
forth in the Agreement and in any applicable Supplemental Trust Agreement and subject to the investment 
restrictions imposed upon the Agency by the laws of the State.  Moneys on deposit in the Housing Revenue 
Funds,  the  Project  Revenue  Funds,  the  Housing  Debt  Service  Funds,  the  Project  Debt  Service  Funds,  the 
Housing Reserve Funds and the Project Reserve Funds shall be invested solely in (a) Government Obligations 
of the type described in subdivision (i) or (ii) of the definition of the Trust Agreement and (b) obligations of 
any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America backed by the full faith and credit of the United 
States of America; provided, however, that such moneys may be invested on a temporary basis (fourteen days 
or less) in a money market fund rated in the highest rating category by Moody's and S&P.   
 
Defeasance 
 
 
Bonds  or  portions  of  the  Bonds  (each  such  portion  to  be  in  integral  multiples  of  the  Authorized 
Denomination) which have been paid in full or which are deemed to have been paid in full shall no longer be 
secured by or entitled to the benefits of the Agreement except for the purposes of payment from moneys or 
Government Obligations held by the Trustee or a Paying Agent for such purposes.  When all Bonds which 
have been issued under the Agreement have been paid in full or are deemed to have been paid in full, and all 
other  sums  payable  hereunder  by  the  Agency,  including  all  necessary  and  proper  fees,  compensation  and 
expenses of the Trustee, and Registrar and the Paying Agent, have been paid or are duly provided for, then the 
right, title and interest of the Trustee in and to the Tax Revenues shall thereupon cease, terminate and become 
void, and thereupon the Trustee shall cancel, discharge and release the Agreement, shall execute, acknowledge 
and  deliver  to  the  Agency  such  instruments  of  satisfaction  and  discharge  or  release  as  shall  be  requisite  to 
evidence  such  release  and  such  satisfaction  and  discharge  and  shall  assign  and  deliver  to  the  Agency  any 
property and revenues at the time subject to the Agreement which may then be in the Trustee's possession, 
except funds or securities in which such funds are invested and held by the Trustee or the Paying Agents for 
the payment of the principal of, Accreted Value, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds. 
 
 
A Bond shall be deemed to be paid within the meaning of the Article VII and for all purposes of the 
Agreement when (a) payment of the principal, Accreted Value, interest and premium, if any, either (i) shall 
have been made or caused to be made in accordance with the terms of the Bonds and the Agreement or (ii) 
shall  have  been  provided  for  by  irrevocably  depositing  with  the  Trustee  in  trust  and  irrevocably  set  aside 
exclusively  for  such  payment,  (1)  moneys  sufficient  to  make  such  payment  and/or  (2)  noncallable, 
nonprepayable  Government  Obligations  described  in  subdivision  (i)  or  (ii)  of  the  definition  of  the  Trust 
Agreement,  maturing  as  to  principal  and  interest  in  such  amounts  and  at  such  times  as  will  insure  the 
availability of sufficient moneys to make such payment, (b) all necessary and proper fees, compensation and 
expenses of the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent pertaining to the Bonds with respect to which such 
deposit is made shall have been paid or provision made for the payment of the Trust Agreement, and (c) a 
report shall have been delivered to the Agency and Trustee from a nationally recognized firm of Independent 
Accountants verifying the computations which indicate that such Government Obligations and moneys to be 
irrevocably deposited in trust will be sufficient to provide for the payment of all of the principal of, premium, 
if any, and interest on such Bonds when due in accordance with their terms.  At such times as Bonds shall be 
deemed  to  be  paid  hereunder,  such  Bonds  shall  no  longer  be  secured  by  or  entitled  to  the  benefits  of  the 
Agreement, except for the purposes of payment from such moneys or Government Obligations.

The Trustee shall be under no obligation to take any action with respect to any Event 

Bondholders'  Right  to  Direct  Proceedings. 

 
Restoration to Former Position.  In the event that any proceeding taken by the Trustee to enforce any 
 
right  under  the  Agreement  shall  have  been  discontinued  or  abandoned  for  any  reason,  or  shall  have  been 
determined adversely to the Trustee, then the Agency, the Trustee, and the Bondholders shall be restored to 
their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee 
shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken. 
 
  Anything  in  the  Agreement  to  the  contrary 
 
notwithstanding, holders of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding hereunder shall have 
the right, at any time, by an instrument in writing executed and delivered to the Trustee, to direct the time, 
method and place of conducting all remedial proceedings available to the Trustee under the Agreement to be 
taken  in  connection  with  the  enforcement  of  the  terms  of  the  Agreement  or  exercising  any  trust  or  power 
conferred  on  the  Trustee  by  the  Agreement;  provided  that  such  direction  shall  not  be  otherwise  than  in 
accordance with the provisions of the law and the Agreement and that there shall have been provided to the 
Trustee  security  and  indemnity  satisfactory  to  the  Trustee  against  the  costs,  expenses  and  liabilities  to  be 
incurred as a result thereof by the Trustee. So long as the Insurer is not in default under the Municipal 
Bond Insurance Policy, the Insurer shall be deemed the sole holder of the insured Bonds for the purpose 
of exercising any voting right or privilege or giving any consent or direction or taking any other action

any other remedy hereunder or on such Bonds, unless such Bondholder or Bondholders previously shall have 
given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default as hereinabove provided and unless also holders of 
25%  or  more  of  the  principal  amount  and  Accreted  Value  of  the  Bonds  then  Outstanding  shall  have  made  
written request of the Trustee so to do, after the right to institute such suit, action or proceeding under Section 
8.02 of the Trust Agreement shall have accrued, and shall have afforded the Trustee a reasonable opportunity 
to proceed to institute the same in either its or their name and unless there also shall have been offered to the 
Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein 
or  thereby,  and  the  Trustee  shall  not  have  complied  with  such  request  within  a  reasonable  time;  and  such 
notification, request and offer of indemnity are hereby declared in every such case, at the option of the Trustee, 
to be conditions precedent to the institution of such suit, action or proceeding; it being understood and intended 
that no one or more of the Bondholders shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by his or their action to 
affect, disturb or prejudice the security of the Agreement, or to enforce any right hereunder or under the Bonds,

Duties of Trustee. 

(a) 

If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise its 
 
rights and powers and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would 
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs. 

 

(b) 

Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: 

(1) 

 
the Agreement and no others; and 

the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in 

 

 

 

 

(2) 

 
in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as 
to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed, upon certificates 
or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of the Agreement.  
However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether they 
conform to the requirements of the Agreement. 

 
 
No provisions of the Agreement shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise 
incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its 
rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate 
indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. 
 
 
 

Rights of Trustee. 

(a) 

 
Subject  to  the  foregoing  Section,  the  Trustee  may  rely  and  shall  be  protected  in 
acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, request, consent, order, 
bond or other paper document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the 
proper person, and the Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document. 

(b) 

 
Authorized Agency Representative or a written opinion of counsel. 

Before  the  Trustee  acts  or  refrains  from  acting,  it  may  require  a  certificate  of  an 

 
Notice  of  Defaults.    The  Trustee  shall  not  be  deemed  to  have  knowledge  of  any  Event  of  Default 
 
unless  and  until  a  Responsible  Officer  of  the  Trustee  shall  have  actual  knowledge  thereof  or  shall  have 
received written notice thereof at its principal office.  If an event occurs which with the giving of notice or 
lapse of time or both would be an Event of Default, and if the event is continuing and if it is actually known to 
the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Bondholder notice of the event within 30 days after it occurs and 
becomes  known  to the  Trustee.   Except in  the case of  a  default  in payment  or  purchase  of  any  Bonds,  the 
Trustee  may  withhold  the  notice  if  and  so  long  as  a  committee  of  its  Responsible  Officers  in  good  faith 
determines that withholding the notice is in the interest of the Bondholders. 
 
Eligibility of Trustee.  The Agreement shall always have a Trustee that is a trust company or a bank 
 
having the powers of a trust company and is organized and doing business under the laws of the United States 
or  any  state  or  the  District  of  Columbia,  is  subject  to  supervision  or  examination  by  the  United  States  of 
America,  any  State  or  District  of  Columbia  authority  and  has  combined  capital  and  surplus  of  at  least 
$50,000,000  [$75,000,000  for  Central  Imperial]  as  set  forth  in  its  most  recent  published  annual  report  of 
condition. 
 
Replacement of Trustee.  The Trustee may resign by notifying the Agency in writing at least 60 days 
 
prior to the proposed effective date of the resignation.  The Agency, the Insurer or the holders of a majority in 
principal amount of the Bonds may remove the Trustee by notice in writing delivered to the Trustee, if (a) the 

C-39 

No resignation or removal of the Trustee shall be effective until a new Trustee has taken office. 

If the Trustee resigns or is removed or for any reason is unable or unwilling to perform its duties under 

Trustee  fails  to  comply  with  the  terms  of  the  Agreement,  (b)  the  Trustee  is  adjudged  a  bankrupt  or  an 
insolvent,  (c) a  receiver or other  public  officer  takes  charges  of  the Trustee  or  its  property,  (d)  the  Trustee 
otherwise becomes incapable of acting or (e) the Agency determines that the Trustee's services are no longer 
satisfactory  to  the  Agency;  provided,  however,  that  the  Agency  shall  have  no  right  to  remove  the  Trustee 
during any time when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 
 
 
 
 
the Agreement, the Agency shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. 
 
 
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to 
the Agency.  Immediately thereafter, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the 
successor Trustee, the resignation or removal of the rating Trustee shall then (but only then) become effective 
and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under the Agreement.  The 
successor Trustee shall notify the Bondholders of its appointment. 
 
 
If  a  successor  Trustee  does  not  take  office  within  60  days  after  retiring  Trustee  delivers  notice  of 
resignation,  the  Agency  or  the  Holders  of  a  majority  in  principal  amount  of  the  Bonds  or  the  Trustee  may 
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. 
 
Paying  Agents,  Registrars  and  other  Agents.    The  Agency  may  at  any  time  or  from  time  to  time 
 
appoint Paying Agents, Registrars and other agents for one or more Series of Bonds and may remove the same 
all in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement and one or more Supplemental Trust Agreements. 
 
 
 

Accounting Records and Reports of the Trustee. 

 

(a)

account  in  which  complete  and  accurate  entries  shall  be  made  of  all  transactions  relating  to  the 
proceeds  of  the  Bonds,  the  Tax  Revenues  and  all  funds  and  accounts  established  and  held  by  the 
Trustee  pursuant  to  the  Agreement.    Such  books  of  record  and  account  shall  be  available  for 
inspection by the Agency and Bondholder, or his agent or representative duly authorized in writing, at 
reasonable hours under reasonable circumstances. 

(b) 

 
The Trustee shall provide to the Agency each month a monthly report of Pledged Tax

(10) 

 
to comply with the requirements of the Code as are necessary, in the opinion of Bond

Agreement subsequent to the initial Supplemental Trust Agreements, there shall have been delivered to the 
Agency  an  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel  stating  that  such  Supplemental  Trust  Agreement  is  authorized  or 
permitted by the Agreement, the Act and other applicable law, complies with their respective terms, will, upon 
the execution and delivery of the Trust Agreement, be valid and binding upon the Agency in accordance with 
its  terms  and  will  not,  in  itself,  adversely  affect  the  exemption  from  federal  income  taxation  of  interest  on 
Bonds which are then unpaid and for which there has been delivered an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect 
that interest in such Bonds is exempt from federal income taxation. 
 
 
 

B.  Supplemental Trust Agreements Requiring Consent of Bondholders. 

(1) 

 
Except for any Supplemental Trust Agreement entered into pursuant to Paragraph A 
above and any Supplemental Trust Agreement entered into pursuant to Paragraph B(2) below, subject 
to the terms and provisions contained in this Paragraph B and not otherwise, the Holders of not less 
than 60% in aggregate principal amount and Accreted Value of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have 

C-41 

the  right  from  time  to  time  to  consent  to  and  approve  the  execution  by  the  Agency  of  any 
Supplemental  Trust  Agreement  deemed  necessary  or  desirable  by  the  Agency  for  the  purpose  of 
modifying,  altering,  amending,  supplementing  or  rescinding,  in  any  particular,  any  of  the  terms  or 
provisions  contained  in  the  Agreement  or  in  a  Supplemental  Trust  Agreement;  provided,  however, 
that,  unless  approved  in  writing  by  the  holders  of  all  the  Bonds  then  Outstanding  or  unless  such 
change  affects  less  than  all  Series  of  Bonds  then  Outstanding  and  the  following  subsection  (2)  is 
applicable, nothing herein contained shall permit, or be construed as permitting, (i) a change in the 
times,  amounts  or  currency  of  payment  of  the  principal  of,  Accreted  Value  or  interest  on  any 
Outstanding Bonds, or (ii) a reduction in the principal amount, Accreted Value or redemption price of 
any Outstanding Bonds or the rate of or interest thereon; and provided that nothing herein contained, 
including the provisions of Paragraph B(2) below, shall, unless approved in writing by the Holders of 
all the Bonds then outstanding, permit or be construed as permitting (iii) the creation of a lien (except 
as expressly permitted by the Agreement as originally executed) upon or pledge of the Pledged Tax 
Revenues  created  by  the  Agreement,  ranking  prior  to  or  on  a  parity  with  the  claim  created  by  the 
Agreement, or (iv) except with respect to additional security which may be provided for a particular 
Series of Bonds, a preference or priority of any Bond or Bonds over any other Bond or Bonds, or (v) a 
reduction  in  the  aggregate  principal  amount  and  Accreted  Value  of  Bonds  the  consent  of  the 
Bondholders  of  which  is  required  for  any  such  Supplemental  Trust  Agreement  as  authorized  in 
Section 10.02, including the granting, for the benefit of particular Series of Bonds, security in addition 
to the pledge of the Pledged Tax Revenues. 

(2) 

 
The  Agency  and  the  Trustee  may,  from  time  to  time  and  at  any  time  execute  a 
Supplemental  Trust  Agreement  which  amends  the  provisions  of  an  earlier  Supplemental  Trust 
Agreement under which a Series or multiple Series of Bonds were issued.  If such Supplemental Trust 
Agreement is executed for one of the purposes set forth in Paragraph A, no notice to or consent of the 
Bondholders  shall  be  required.    If  such  Supplemental  Trust  Agreement  contains  provisions  which 
affect  the  rights  and  interest  of  less  than  all  Series  of  Bonds  Outstanding  and  Paragraph  A  is  not 
applicable, then this subsection B(2) rather than subsection B(1) above shall control and, subject to the 
terms and provisions contained in this Paragraph B and not otherwise, the Holders of not less than 
60% in aggregate principal amount and Accreted Value of the Bonds of all Series which are affected 
by such changes shall have the right from time to time to consent to and approve the execution by the 
Agency of any Supplemental Trust Agreement deemed necessary or desirable by the Agency for the 
purposes of modifying, altering, amending, supplementing, or rescinding, in any particular, any of the 
terms or provisions contained in such Supplemental Trust Agreement and affecting only the Bonds of 
such Series; provided, however, that, unless approved in writing by the Holders of all the Bonds of all 
the  affected  Series  then  Outstanding,  nothing  herein  contained  shall  permit,  or  be  construed  as 
permitting, (i) a change in the times, amounts or currency of payment of the principal of or interest on 
any Outstanding Bonds of such Series or (ii) a reduction in the principal amount, Accreted Value or 
redemption  price  of  any  Outstanding  Bonds  of  such  Series  or  the  rate  of  interest  thereon.  Nothing 
herein contained, however, shall be construed as making necessary the approval by Bondholders of 
the adoption of any Supplemental Trust Agreement as authorized in Paragraph A above, including the 
granting, for the benefit of particular Series of Bonds, security in addition to the pledge of the Pledged 
Tax Revenues. 

(3) 

 
If  at  any  time  the  Agency  shall  desire  to  enter  into  any  Supplemental  Trust 
Agreement for any of the purposes of this Paragraph B, the Agency shall cause notice of the proposed 
execution  of  the  Supplemental  Trust  Agreement  to  be  given  by  Mail  to  all  Bondholders  or,  under 
Paragraph B(2), all Bondholders of the affected Series.  Such notice shall briefly set forth the nature of 
the proposed Supplemental Trust Agreement and shall state that a copy of the Trust Agreement is on 
file at the office of the Agency for inspection by all Bondholders. 

(4) 

 
Within two weeks after the date of the first mailing of such notice, the Agency and 
the  Trustee  may  execute  and  deliver  such  Supplemental  Trust  Agreement  in  substantially  the  form 

C-42 

 

 

 

 

described in such notice, but only if there shall have first been delivered to the Agency and the Trustee 
(i) the required consents, in writing, of Bondholders and (ii) an opinion of Bond Counsel stating that 
such Supplemental Trust Agreement is authorized or permitted by the Agreement and other applicable 
law, complies with their respective terms and, upon the execution and delivery thereof, will be valid 
and binding upon the Agency in accordance with its terms and will not adversely affect the exemption 
from federal income taxation of interest on the Bonds.   

(5) 

 
If Bondholders of not less than the percentage of Bonds required by this Paragraph B 
shall  have  consented  to  and  approved  the  execution  and  delivery  thereof  and  herein  provide,  no 
Bondholders shall have any right to object to the adoption of such Supplemental Trust Agreement, or 
to  object  to  any  of  the  terms  and  provisions  contained  therein  or  the  operation  thereof,  or  in  any 
manner  to  question  the  propriety  of  the  execution  and  delivery  thereof,  to  enjoin  or  restrain  the 
Agency from executing the same or from taking any action pursuant to the provisions thereof. 

 
Miscellaneous Provisions 
 
No Personal Liability of Agency Officials; Limited Liability of Agency to Bondholders.  No covenant 
 
or agreement contained in the Bonds or in the Agreement shall be deemed to be the covenant or agreement of 
any present or future official, officer, agent or employee of the Agency in his individual capacity, and neither 
the members of the Agency  nor any person executing the Bonds shall be liable personally on the Bonds or be 
subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof. 
 
 
Except for the payment from the Pledged Tax Revenues when due of the payments and the observance 
and  performance  of  the  other  agreements,  conditions,  covenants  and  terms  required  to  be  performed  by  it 
contained  in  the  Agreement,  the  Agency  shall  not  have  any  obligation  or  liability  to  the  Bondholders  with 
respect  to  the  Agreement  or  the  preparation,  execution,  delivery,  transfer,  exchange  or  cancellation  of  the 
Bonds  or  the  receipt,  deposit  or  disbursement  of  the  payments  by  the  Trustee,  or  with  respect  to  the 
performance by the Trustee of any obligation required to be performed by it contained in the Agreement.

APPENDIX D 

BOOK–ENTRY SYSTEM 

The information concerning DTC and DTC book–entry system has been obtained from DTC, 

and the Agency and the Underwriters take no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness thereof. 

DTC  will  act  as  securities depository  for  the Bonds.   The  Bonds  will be  issued as  fully–registered 
securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be 
requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  One fully–registered Bond will be issued for each series 
and maturity of the Bonds, in the aggregate principal amount of each such maturity, and will be deposited with 
DTC. 

DTC is a limited–purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking 
organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a 
“clearing  corporation”  within  the  meaning  of  the  New  York  Uniform  Commercial  Code,  and  a  “clearing 
agency”  registered  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Section  17A  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as 
amended.  DTC  holds  and  provides  asset  servicing  for  over  2.2  million  issues  of  U.S.  and  non–U.S.  equity 
issues,  corporate  and  municipal  debt  issues,  and  money  market  instruments  from  over  100  countries  that 
DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC.  DTC also facilitates the post–trade settlement 
among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic 
computerized  book–entry  transfers  and  pledges  between  Direct  Participants’  accounts.    This  eliminates  the 
need  for  physical  movement  of  securities  certificates.  Direct  Participants  include  both  U.S.  and  non–U.S. 
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations.  
DTC is a wholly–owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”).  DTCC, in 
turn, is owned by a number of Direct Participants of DTC and Members of the National Securities Clearing 
Corporation,  Fixed  Income  Clearing  Corporation,  and  Emerging  Markets  Clearing  Corporation,  (“NSCC,” 
“FICC,” and “EMCC,” also subsidiaries of DTCC), as well as by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the 
American Stock Exchange LLC, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.  Access to the DTC 
system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non–U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust 
companies,  and  clearing  corporations  that  clear  through  or  maintain  a  custodial  relationship  with  a  Direct 
Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).  DTC has Standard & Poor’s highest rating: 
AAA.  The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
More  information  about  DTC  can  be  found  at  www.dtcc.com  and  www.dtc.org.  The  information  on  these 
websites is not incorporated herein by reference. 

Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will 
receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records.  The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of Bonds 
(“Beneficial  Owner”)  is  in  turn  to  be  recorded  on  the  Direct  and  Indirect  Participants’  records.  Beneficial 
Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase.  Beneficial Owners are, however, 
expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of 
their  holdings,  from  the  Direct  or  Indirect  Participant through  which  the  Beneficial  Owner  entered  into  the 
transaction.    Transfers  of  ownership  interests  in  the  Bonds  are  to  be  accomplished  by  entries  made  on  the 
books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners.  Beneficial Owners will not 
receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book–
entry system for the Bonds is discontinued. 

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered 
in  the  name  of  DTC’s  partnership  nominee,  Cede  &  Co.,  or  such  other  name  as  may  be  requested  by  an 
authorized representative of DTC.  The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede 
& Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership.  DTC has no knowledge 
of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants 

D-1 

 
 

 

to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners.  The Direct and 
Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 

Conveyance  of  notices  and  other  communications  by  DTC  to  Direct  Participants,  by  Direct 
Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners 
will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be 
in effect from time to time. 

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Bonds 
unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s Procedures.  Under its usual procedures, 
DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Agency as soon as possible after the record date.  The Omnibus Proxy 
assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Bonds are 
credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). 

Payments of principal of and interest, purchase price and redemption premium, if any, on the Bonds 
will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of 
DTC.  DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding 
detail  information  from  the  Agency  or  the  Trustee,  on  a  payable  date  in  accordance  with  their  respective 
holdings  shown  on  DTC’s  records.    Payments  by  Participants  to  Beneficial  Owners  will  be  governed  by 
standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers 
in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, 
the Trustee, or the Agency, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to 
time.  Payment of principal, purchase price, redemption premium, if any, and interest payments to Cede & Co. 
(or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of 
the Agency or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of 
DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and 
Indirect Participants.   

DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Bonds at any 
time by giving reasonable notice to the Agency or the Trustee.  Under such circumstances, in the event that a 
successor depository is not obtained, certificates are required to be printed and delivered. 

The Agency may decide to discontinue use of the system of book–entry transfers through DTC (or a 
successor securities depository).  In that event, securities certificates will be printed and delivered as described 
in the Indentures. 

The  Agency,  the  Authority,  the  Underwriters  and  the  Trustee  cannot  and  do  not  give  any 
assurances that DTC, DTC Participants or others will distribute payments of principal, interest or any 
premium  with  respect  to  the  Bonds  paid  to  DTC  or  its  nominee  as  the  registered  owner,  or  any 
redemption or other notices, to the Beneficial Owners, or that they will do so on a timely basis or will 
serve  and  act  in  the  manner  described  in  this  Official  Statement.    The  Agency,  the  Authority,  the 
Underwriters  and  the  Trustee  are  not  responsible  or  liable  for  the  failure  of  DTC  or  any  DTC 
Participant to make any payment or give any notice to a Beneficial Owner with respect to the Bonds or 
any error or delay relating thereto.

Pooled Financing Bonds, 2007 Series B (Tax Exempt) 

(Southcrest and Central Imperial Redevelopment Projects) 

(Final Opinion) 

 
Ladies and Gentlemen: 
 

  We have served as bond counsel in connection with the issuance by the Public Facilities Financing 
Authority of the City of San Diego, California (the “Authority”) of its $17,230,000 Pooled Financing Bonds, 
2007 Series A (Taxable) (Southcrest, Central Imperial and Mount Hope Redevelopment Projects) (the “Series 
A Bonds”) and its $17,755,000 Pooled Financing Bonds, 2007 Series B (Tax-Exempt) (Southcrest and Central 
Imperial  Redevelopment  Projects)  (the  “Series  B  Bonds”  and,  collectively  with  the  Series  A  Bonds,  the 
“Bonds”). The Bonds are being issued pursuant to the Constitution and the laws of the State of California (the 
“State”), including the provisions of Articles 1 through 4 (commencing with Section 6500) of Chapter 5 of 
Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code of the State, and pursuant to  separate Indentures of Trust, each 
dated as of June 1, 2007 (the “Indentures”), by and between the Authority and the Bank of New York Trust 
Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Series A Bonds are being issued to provide funds to make three 
loans  to  the Redevelopment  Agency  of  the  City  of San  Diego, California  (the “Agency”)  pursuant  to  three 
separate  loan  agreements  and  supplemental  trust  agreements,  all  dated  as  of  June  1,  2007  (the  “Loan 
Agreements”),  each  of  which  are  by  and  among  the  Authority,  the  Agency  and  the  Trustee.  The  Series  B 
Bonds are being issued to provide funds to make two additional loans to the Agency pursuant to two of the 
above mentioned Loan Agreements. 

In  that  connection,  we  have  examined  certified  copies  of  the  proceedings  of  the  Authority  and  the 
Agency with respect to the authorization and issuance of the Bonds, including but not limited to Resolutions 
adopted by the Council of the City of San Diego on June 12, 2007 and July 10, 2007, Resolutions adopted by 
the  Boards  of  the  Authority  and  of  the  Agency  on  June  14,  2007  and  June  12,  2007,  respectively,  the 
Indentures, the Loan Agreements and such opinions, certificates and other documents as we deemed necessary 
or appropriate to render the opinions herein.  

E-1 

 

 

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court 
decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected 
by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof.  We have not undertaken to determine or 
to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur. Our engagement with 
respect to the Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any obligation to update this letter.  
We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to us (whether as originals or as 
copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than the 
Authority and the Agency.  We have not undertaken to verify independently, and have assumed, the accuracy 
of  the  factual  matters  represented,  warranted  or  certified  in  the  documents,  and  of  the  legal  conclusions 
contained  in  the  opinions,  referred  to  in  the  second  paragraph  hereof.    Furthermore,  we  have  assumed 
compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Indentures, the Loan Agreements and other 
relevant documents.  

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the 

opinion that: 

1.  The Authority is a joint exercise of powers authority duly organized and validly existing under 
the laws of the State with full power to enter into the Indentures and the Loan Agreements, to perform the 
agreements on its part contained therein, and to issue the Bonds. 

2.  The  Indentures  and  the  Loan  Agreements  have  been  duly  approved  by  the  Authority  and 
constitute valid and binding obligations of the Authority enforceable against the Authority in accordance with 
their respective terms. Each Indenture creates a valid pledge of the Revenues (as such term is defined in the 
applicable Indenture), in accordance with terms of the applicable Indenture. 

3.  The Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Authority and are valid and 

binding special obligations of the Authority.  

4.  The  Loan  Agreements  have  been  duly  approved  by  the  Agency  and  constitute  the  valid  and 
binding obligations of the Agency enforceable against the Agency in accordance with their respective terms. 
Each Loan Agreement creates a valid pledge of the Pledged Tax Revenues (as such term is defined in each 
Loan Agreement), in accordance with the terms of the applicable Loan Agreement. 

5.  The  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  to  date  (the  “Code”)  imposes  certain 
requirements that must be met subsequent to the issuance and delivery of the Bonds for interest thereon to be 
and  remain  excluded  from  the  gross  income  of  the  owners  thereof  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  
Noncompliance with such requirements could cause the interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income 
retroactive to the date of issue of the Bonds.  The Agency and the Authority have covenanted in the Indenture 
and the Loan Agreements related to the Series B Bonds to maintain the exclusion of interest on the Series B 
Bonds from the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes, but have made no such 
covenants with respect to the Series A Bonds.  In our opinion, under existing law, interest on the Series A 
Bonds and the Series B Bonds is exempt from personal income taxes of the State of California.  Under existing 
statutes,  regulations,  rulings  and  court  decisions,  assuming  compliance  with  the  aforementioned  covenants, 
interest on the Series B Bonds is excluded pursuant to section 103 of the Code from the gross income of the 
owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. We are of the further opinion that the Series B Bonds are not 
“specified  private  activity  bonds”  within  the  meaning  of  section  57(a)(5)  of  the  Code  and,  therefore,  that 
interest on the Series B Bonds will not be treated as an item of tax preference for purposes of computing the 
alternative minimum tax imposed by section 55 of the Code, although we observe that such interest is included 
in  adjusted  current  earnings  in  calculating  corporate  alternative  minimum  taxable  income.    We  express  no 
opinion regarding any other tax consequences relating to the ownership or disposition of, or accrual or receipt 
of interest on the Series A Bonds or the Series B Bonds, although we observe, assuming noncompliance by the 
Agency and the Authority with the above mentioned requirements of the Code with respect to the Series A 

E-2 

 

 

Bonds, that interest on the Series A Bonds will be fully includable in the gross income of the recipients thereof 
for federal income tax purposes (taxable). 

We call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Bonds, the Indentures and the 
Loan  Agreements  may  be  subject  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  arrangement,  fraudulent 
conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, to the application of equitable 
principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies 
against local agencies in the State. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, 
choice  of  law,  choice  of  forum  or  waiver  provisions  contained  in  the  foregoing  documents.  Further,  we 
undertake  no  responsibility  for  the  accuracy,  completeness  or  fairness  of  the  Official  Statement  or  other 
offering material relating to the Bonds and express no opinion with respect thereto and we express no opinion 
as  to  the  sufficiency  of  the  Tax  Revenues,  Pledged  Tax  Revenues  or  Revenues  to  pay  debt  service  on  the 
Bonds. 

Our opinions are based on existing law, which is subject to change. Such opinions are further based on 
our knowledge  of  facts  as of  the date hereof.  We  assume  no duty  to  update or  supplement  our  opinions  to 
reflect any facts or circumstances that may thereafter come to our attention or to reflect any changes in any law 
that may thereafter occur or become effective. Moreover, our opinions are not a guarantee of result and are not 
binding on the Internal Revenue Service; rather, such opinions represent our legal judgment based upon our 
review of existing law that we deem relevant to such opinions and in reliance upon the representations and 
covenants referenced above.

FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE CERTIFICATE 

This Continuing Disclosure Certificate, dated as of June 1, 2007 (the “Disclosure Certificate”) is 
executed and delivered by the Redevelopment Agency of the City of San Diego (the “Agency”) in connection with 
the  issuance  of  the  $17,230,000  Public  Facilities  Financing  Authority  of  the  City  of  San  Diego,  California  (the 
“Authority”),  Pooled  Financing  Bonds  2007  Series  A  (Taxable)  (Southcrest,  Central  Imperial  and  Mount  Hope 
Redevelopment Projects) (the “Taxable Bonds”) and the $17,755,000 Public Facilities Financing Authority of the 
City  of  San  Diego,  California,  Pooled  Financing  Bonds  2007  Series  B  (Tax-Exempt)  (Southcrest  and  Central

The  Taxable  Bonds  are  being  issued  pursuant  to  an  Indenture  of  Trust,  dated  as  of  June  1,  2007  (the  “Taxable

Dissemination  Agent  shall  be  the  Trustee.  The  Dissemination  Agent  may  resign  as  Dissemination  Agent  by 
providing  thirty  days  written  notice  to  the  Agency  and  the  Trustee.    The  Dissemination  Agent  shall  not  be 
responsible for the content of any report or notice prepared by the Agency.  The Dissemination Agent shall have no 
duty to prepare any information report nor shall the Dissemination Agent be responsible for filing any report not 
provided to it by the Agency in a timely manner and in a form suitable for filing. 

The Agency may satisfy its obligations hereunder to file any notice, document or information with 
a National Repository or State Repository by filing the same with any dissemination agent or conduit, including any

SEC staff or required by the SEC. For this purpose, permission shall be deemed to have been granted by the SEC 
staff if and to the extent the dissemination agent or conduit has received an interpretive letter, which has not been 
revoked, from the SEC staff to the effect that using the agent or conduit to transmit information to the National

directly to the National Repository and State Repository. 

Section  8.    Amendment;  Waiver.    Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Disclosure 
Certificate, the Agency may amend this Disclosure Certificate, and any provision of this Disclosure Certificate may 
be waived (provided no amendment that modifies or increases its duties or obligations of the Dissemination Agent 
shall  be  effective  without  the  consent  of  the  Dissemination  Agent),  provided  that  the  following  conditions  are 
satisfied: 

(a)   

if the amendment or waiver relates to the provisions of Sections 3(a), 4 or 5(a), it may only 
be made in connection with a change in circumstances that arises from a change in legal requirements, change in 
law, or change in the identity, nature, or status of an obligated person with respect to the Bonds, or type of business 
conducted; 

(b)   

the undertakings herein, as proposed to be amended or waived, would, in the opinion of 
nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with the requirements of the Rule at the time of the primary 
offering of the Bonds, after taking into account any amendments or interpretations of the Rule, as well as any change 
in circumstances; and 

(c)   

the proposed amendment or waiver either (i) is approved by holders of the Bonds in the 
manner provided in the Indenture for amendments to the Indenture with the consent of holders, or (ii) does not, in 
the  opinion  of    nationally  recognized  bond  counsel,  materially  impair  the  interests  of  the  holders  or  beneficial 
owners of the Bonds. 

If  the  annual  financial  information  or  operating  data  to  be  provided  in  the  Annual  Report  is 
amended pursuant to the provisions hereof, the first annual financial information filed pursuant hereto containing the 
amended operating data or financial information shall explain, in narrative form, the reasons for the amendment and 
the impact of the change in the type of operating data or financial information being provided. 

If an amendment is made to the undertaking specifying the accounting principles to be followed in 
preparing  financial  statements,  the  annual  financial  information  for  the  year  in  which  the  change  is  made  shall 
present a comparison between the financial statements or information prepared on the basis of the new accounting 
principles  and  those  prepared  on  the  basis  of  the  former  accounting  principles.  The  comparison  shall  include  a 
qualitative discussion of the differences in the accounting principles and the impact of the change in the accounting 
principles on the presentation of the financial information, in order to provide information to investors to enable 
them to evaluate the ability of the Agency to meet its obligations. To the extent reasonably feasible, the comparison 
shall be quantitative. A notice of the change in the accounting principles shall be sent to the Repositories in the same 
manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5(c). 

Section 9.  Additional Information.  Nothing in this Disclosure Certificate shall be deemed to 
prevent the Agency from disseminating any other information, using the means of dissemination set forth in this 
Disclosure  Certificate  or  any  other  means  of  communication,  or  including  any  other  information  in  any  Annual 
Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event, in addition to that which is required by this Disclosure Certificate.  
If the Agency chooses to include any information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event in 
addition to that which is specifically required by this Disclosure Certificate, the Agency shall have no obligation 
under this Disclosure Certificate to update such information or include it in any future Annual Report or notice of 
occurrence of a Listed Event. 

Section 10.  Default.  In the event of a failure of the Agency to comply with any provision of this 
Disclosure Certificate, any Participating Underwriter or any holder or beneficial owner of the Bonds may take such 
actions as may be necessary and appropriate, including seeking mandate or specific performance by court order, to 
cause the Agency to comply with its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate. A default under this Disclosure 
Certificate shall not be deemed an Event of Default under the Indentures, and the sole remedy under this Disclosure 

F-4 

 

 

Certificate in the event of any failure of the Agency to comply with this Disclosure Certificate shall be an action to 
compel performance. 

Section 11.  Duties, Immunities and Liabilities of Dissemination Agent.  The Dissemination 
Agent shall have only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Disclosure Certificate, and the Agency agrees to 
indemnify  and  save  the  Dissemination  Agent,  its  officers,  directors,  employees  and  agents,  harmless  against  any 
loss, expense and liabilities which it may incur arising out of or in the exercise or performance of its powers and 
duties  hereunder,  including  the  costs  and  expenses  (including  attorneys  fees)  of  defending  against  any  claim  of 
liability,  but  excluding  liabilities  due  to  the  Dissemination  Agent’s  negligence  or  willful  misconduct.    The 
Dissemination Agent shall be paid compensation by the Agency for its services provided hereunder in accordance 
with its schedule of fees as amended from time  to time  and shall be reimbursed for all expenses, legal fees and 
advances  made  or  incurred  by  the  Dissemination  Agent  in  the  performance  of  its    duties  hereunder.    The 
Dissemination Agent shall have no duty or obligation to review any information provided to it hereunder and shall 
not be deemed to be acting in any fiduciary capacity for the Agency, the Authority, the Bondholders, or any other 
party.  Other than in the case of negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Dissemination Agent, the 
Dissemination Agent shall not have any liability to the Bondholders or any other party for any monetary damages or 
financial  liability  of  any  kind  whatsoever  related  to  or  arising  from  any  breach  of  any  obligation  of  the 
Dissemination Agent.  The obligations of the Agency under this Section shall survive resignation or removal of the 
Dissemination Agent and payment of the Bonds. 

Section  12.    Beneficiaries.    This  Disclosure  Certificate  shall  inure  solely  to  the  benefit  of  the 
Agency,  the  Dissemination Agent,  the  Participating  Underwriter  and holders  and beneficial  owners  from  time  to

consideration of the payment of the premium and subject to the terms of this Policy, hereby unconditionally and 
irrevocably guarantees the payment of the Obligation (hereinafter defined) to the Insurance Trustee for the 
benefit of the Holders (hereinafter defined) from time to time of the Bonds.  This Policy does not insure against 
any risk other than nonpayment of the Obligation by or on behalf of the Obligor or any other obligor to the Bond 
Trustee.  Nonpayment includes recovery from a Holder of Bonds or the Bond Trustee of any portion of the 
Obligation pursuant to a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction holding that such payment 
constituted a voidable preference within the meaning of any applicable bankruptcy law. 
 
Upon receipt by the Insurer of telephonic or telegraphic notice, such notice subsequently confirmed to the 
Insurer in writing by registered or certified mail, from the Insurance Trustee that the Obligor (or other obligor 
responsible for payment of the Obligation) has failed to provide the Bond Trustee with sufficient funds for 
payment of the Obligation on the Due Date (hereinafter defined), the Insurer shall, not later than such Due Date 
or the first business day after receipt of such notice, whichever is later, pay to the Insurance Trustee for the 
benefit of the Holders of the Bonds an amount which shall be sufficient to pay the Obligation, but only upon 
receipt by the Insurer, in a form reasonably satisfactory to it, of (a) evidence of the Holder's right to receive such 
payment and (b) evidence, including any appropriate instruments of assignment, that all the Holder's rights with 
respect to such payment shall thereupon vest in the Insurer.  "Due Date" means, when referring to the principal 
of the Obligation, the stated maturity date thereof or the date on which the same shall have been duly called for 
mandatory sinking fund prepayment and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason 
of any other call for redemption, acceleration or other advancement of maturity unless the Insurer shall elect, in 
its sole discretion, to pay such principal due upon such redemption, acceleration or other advancement of 
maturity together with any accrued interest to the date of redemption, acceleration or other advancement of 
maturity.  Tendering of payment, to the Bond Trustee, of such principal due upon such redemption, acceleration 
or  other  advancement  of  maturity,  together  with  any  accrued  interest  to  the  date  of  such  redemption, 
acceleration or other advancement of maturity, shall satisfy the Insurer's obligations under this Policy, in full.  
When referring to interest on the Obligation, "Due Date" means the stated date for payment of interest.

As used herein, the term “Holder” or "Holders" means the registered owners of the Bonds as indicated in the 
registration  books  maintained  by  the  Bond  Trustee  for  such  purpose  at  the  time  of  nonpayment  of  the 
Obligation.  The terms “Holder” or “Holders” shall not include the Obligor or any person or entity whose direct or 
indirect obligation constitutes the underlying security for the Obligation.  As used herein, the term "Bond 
Trustee" means the Bond Trustee above named and any successor trustee duly appointed.  As used herein, 
the term "Insurance Trustee" means the Insurance Trustee above named and any successor insurance trustee 
duly appointed.  As used herein, the term "Obligation" means the payment of principal and interest regularly

mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration or other advancement of maturity. 
 
This Policy is non-cancelable for any reason.  Premiums paid on this Policy are not refundable for any reason 
including without limitation the payment prior to maturity of the Bonds. 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Insurer has caused this Policy to be issued to the Insurance Trustee for the 
benefit of the Holders from time to time of the Bonds and to be executed and delivered by its duly authorized 
officer to become effective and binding upon the Insurer by virtue of the execution and delivery thereof on this
