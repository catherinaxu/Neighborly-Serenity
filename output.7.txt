(See “RATINGS” herein.)

In the opinion of Nixon Peabody LLP, Bond Counsel, under existing law and assuming compliance with the tax covenants described herein, and the 
accuracy of certain representations and certifications made by the District described herein, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal 
income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  Bond Counsel is also of the opinion that such interest is 
not treated as a preference item in calculating the alternative minimum tax imposed under the Code with respect to individuals and corporations.  Bond Counsel 
is further of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is exempt from personal income taxes of the State of California (the “State”) under present State law.  See “TAX 
MATTERS” herein regarding certain other tax considerations.

(Kern County, California) 

$3,860,000 

$3,115,000 

General Obligation Bonds 

Election of 2014, Series 2015A 

and 

General Obligation  

Refunding Bonds, Series 2015A 

INTRODUCTION 

The Arvin Union School District (the “District”), a school district of the State of California (the 
“State”),  proposes  to  issue  $3,115,000  aggregate  principal  amount  of  its  General  Obligation  Bonds 
Election of 2014, Series 2015A (the “Series A Bonds”), under and pursuant to a bond authorization for 
the  issuance  and  sale  of  not  more  than  $15,000,000  of  general  obligation  bonds  (the  “Authorization”) 
approved by more than 55% of the voters of the District voting at an election held on November 4, 2014 
(the “2014 Election”).   

Proceeds  from  the  sale  of  the  Series  A  Bonds  will  be  used  for  the  acquisition,  construction, 
furnishing and equipping of District facilities (collectively, the “Projects”), and the payment of costs of 
issuance  of  the  Series  A  Bonds,  all  as  further  described  herein  under  “PLAN  OF  FINANCE  –  The 
Projects” and as provided in the bond proposition approved at the 2014 Election, in accordance with the 
Constitution and laws of the State.  

The  District  also  proposes  to  issue  $3,860,000  aggregate  principal  amount  of  its  General 
Obligation  Refunding  Bonds,  Series  2015A  (the  “Refunding  Bonds,”  and  together  with  the  Series  A 
Bonds, the “Bonds”), pursuant to the provisions of Articles 9 and 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 
of Title 5 of the California Government Code (commencing with Sections 53550 and 53580, respectively) 
(the  “Refunding  Law”)  and  other  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  State,  to  (i)  advance  refund  a 
portion  of  the  District’s  General  Obligation  Bonds,  Election  of  2004,  Series  2004A  (the  “Refunded 
Bonds”) and (ii) pay costs of issuance of the Refunding Bonds.  See the caption “PLAN OF FINANCE” 
herein. 

The Series A Bonds are the first issue under the Authorization, after which $11,885,000 of the 
Authorization will remain for issuance of subsequent series of the District’s general obligation bonds.  All 
general obligation bonds issued by or on behalf of the District are or will be issued on a parity with the 
Bonds. 
  See  the  caption  “–  Proposition  39”  under  the  heading  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND 
STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND APPROPRIATIONS” herein. 

THE BONDS  ARE  GENERAL  OBLIGATION  BONDS  OF  THE  DISTRICT,  SECURED 
BY  AND  PAYABLE  FROM  AD  VALOREM  PROPERTY  TAXES  ASSESSED  ON  TAXABLE 
PROPERTIES  WITHIN  THE  DISTRICT,  WITHOUT  LIMITATION  AS  TO  RATE  OR 
AMOUNT.    THE  BONDS  ARE  NOT  AN  OBLIGATION  OF  THE  GENERAL  FUND  OF  THE 
DISTRICT  OR  OF  THE  COUNTY  OF  KERN  (THE  “COUNTY”).    SEE  “SECURITY  AND 
SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS” HEREIN. 

The District was established in 1913.  The District is comprised of an area of approximately 270 
square miles within the County.   The District serves students in grades  kindergarten through 8th grade. 
The District currently operates three (3) elementary schools and one middle school.  See APPENDIX A – 
“THE DISTRICT.”     

The  District  has  certain  existing  lease  financing  obligations  as  set  forth  in  APPENDIX  A  and 
direct  and  overlapping  bonded  indebtedness  as  set  forth  under  “SECURITY  AND  SOURCES  OF 
PAYMENT  FOR  THE  BONDS  –  Direct  and  Overlapping  Debt.”    The  District’s  audited  financial

statements  for  fiscal  year  2013-14  are  attached  hereto  as  APPENDIX  C.    For  further  information 
concerning the District, see APPENDIX A – “THE DISTRICT.” 

Authority for Issuance and Security for the Bonds 

THE BONDS 

The  Series  A  Bonds  are  being  issued  by  the  District  under  the  provisions  of  Article  4.5  of 
Chapter 3  of  Part 1  of  Division 2  of  Title 5  of  the  Government  Code  of  the  State,  as  amended,  and 
pursuant  to  a  resolution  of  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  District  adopted  on  April  21,  2015  (the 
“Resolution”). 

The  Refunding  Bonds  are  being  issued  pursuant  to  the  Refunding  Law  and  the  Resolution.  
Pursuant to the Refunding Law, general obligation bonds issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding 
general  obligation  bonds  previously  authorized  by  the  voters  that  reduce  the  debt  service  obligation  of 
taxpayers  do  not  require  additional  voter  approval,  either  for  issuance  of  such  refunding  general 
obligation bonds or the levy of an ad valorem property tax sufficient to pay principal and interest as due 
on the refunding general obligation bonds.  

Purpose of Issue 

The  District  submitted  a  project  list  (the  “Project  List”)  to  the  voters  at  the  2014  Election, 
specifying the Projects, from which a number of components will be financed with the proceeds of the 
Series A Bonds.  Details regarding the Project List and the proposed components to be financed are set 
forth under the caption “PLAN OF FINANCE – The Projects” herein.   

The  net  proceeds  of  sale  of  the  Series  A  Bonds,  after  payment  of  costs  of  issuance,  shall  be 
deposited into the Debt  Service Fund and Building  Fund of the District and applied to pay  capitalized 
interest  on  the  Series  A  Bonds  and  the  costs  of  certain  of  the  Projects.    Any  excess  proceeds  of  the 
Series A Bonds not needed for the authorized purposes for which  the Series  A Bonds are being issued 
shall be transferred to the Debt Service Fund and applied to the payment of the principal of and interest 
on the Series A Bonds.  Moneys in the Debt Service Fund are expected to be invested through the Kern 
County Treasury Pool.  See “THE KERN COUNTY TREASURY POOL” herein. 

The District  will use the net proceeds of the sale of the Refunding Bonds to effect an advance 
refunding of the Refunded Bonds and to pay the costs of issuance of the Refunding Bonds.  The Refunded 
Bonds will be defeased as of the date of delivery of the Refunding Bonds by the deposit and investment 
of net proceeds of the Refunding Bonds with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, in its capacity as 
Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Agent”) under and pursuant to that certain Escrow Agreement, dated as of 
June  1,  2015  (the  ‘Escrow  Agreement”),  by  and  between  the  District  and  the  Escrow  Agent.    Such 
proceeds  deposited  by  the  District,  together  with  investment  earnings  thereon,  are  intended  to  be 
sufficient to pay the redemption price of the Refunded Bonds, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon on 
to  the  redemption  date.    The  sufficiency  of  amounts  on  deposit  under  the  Escrow  Agreement  will  be 
verified by Causey Demgen & Moore P.C., certified public accountants (the “Verification Agent”).  See 
“PLAN OF FINANCE – The Refunding” and “VERIFICATION” herein. 

Description of the Bonds 

All the following provisions apply equally to the Series A Bonds and the Refunding Bonds unless 

the context requires otherwise. 

 
 

2 

 

The Bonds will be issued in the form of current interest bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any 
integral multiple thereof. The Bonds will mature on the dates and in the amounts and bear interest at the 
rates per annum all as set forth on the inside cover page of this Official Statement.  The Bonds are not 
subject to acceleration. 

The Bonds will be issued in fully registered form and, when issued, will be registered in the name 
of Cede & Co., as registered owner and nominee of The Depository  Trust Company, New York, New 
York  (“DTC”).    DTC  will  act  as  securities  depository  for  the  Bonds.    So  long  as  Cede  &  Co.  is  the 
registered owner of the Bonds, as nominee of DTC, references herein to the Owners or registered owners 
shall mean Cede & Co. as aforesaid, and shall not mean the Beneficial Owners (as defined herein) of the 
Bonds. 

So long as Cede & Co. is the registered owner of the Bonds, principal of and interest or premium, 
if any, on the Bonds are payable by wire transfer of New York Clearing House or equivalent next-day 
funds or by wire transfer of same day funds by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as paying agent 
(the  “Paying  Agent”),  to  Cede  &  Co.,  as  nominee  for  DTC.    DTC  is  obligated,  in  turn,  to  remit  such 
amounts  to  the  DTC  Participants  (“DTC  Participants”)  for  subsequent  disbursement  to  the  Beneficial 
Owners.    Payments  of  principal  and  premium,  if  any,  for  any  Bonds  shall  be  made  only  upon  the 
surrender of such Bonds to the Paying Agent.  See APPENDIX E – “BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY SYSTEM” 
herein. 

Payment of the Bonds 

Interest on each Bond shall accrue from its dated date.  Interest on the Bonds shall be computed 
using  a  year  of  360  days  comprised  of  twelve  30-day  months  and  shall  be  payable  on  May  1  and 
November  1  of  each  year  (each,  an  “Interest  Payment  Date”),  commencing  November  1,  2015,  to  the 
registered owner (each, an “Owner”) thereof as of the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day of 
the month preceding any Interest Payment Date (a “Record Date”).  Interest on each Bond will be payable 
from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of registration thereof, unless (i) it is registered 
after  the  close  of  business  on  any  Record  Date  and  before  the  close  of  business  on  the  immediately 
following Interest Payment Date, in which event interest with respect thereto shall be payable from such 
following Interest Payment Date; or (ii) it is registered prior to the close of business on the first Record 
Date, in which event interest shall be payable from its dated date; provided, however, that if at the time of 
registration of any Bond interest with respect thereto is in default, interest with respect thereto shall be 
payable from the Interest Payment Date to which interest has previously been paid or made available for 
payment.  Payments of interest on the Bonds will be made on each Interest Payment Date by check or 
draft of the Paying Agent sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Owner thereof on the Record 
Date, or by wire transfer to any Owner of $1,000,000 or more of such Bonds, to the account specified by 
such Owner in a written request delivered to the Paying Agent on or prior to the Record Date for such 
Interest  Payment  Date;  provided,  however,  that  payments  of  defaulted  interest  shall  be  payable  to  the 
person  in  whose  name  such  Bond  is  registered  at  the  close  of  business  on  a  special  record  date  fixed 
therefor by the Paying Agent, which shall not be more than 15 days and not less than ten days prior to the 
date of the proposed payment of defaulted interest.

Selection of Bonds for Redemption 

Whenever provision is made for the redemption of Bonds and less than all Outstanding Bonds of 
a Series are to be redeemed, the Paying Agent, upon written instruction from the District given at least 60 
days prior to the date designated for such redemption, shall select Bonds for redemption in such order as 
the District may direct, or, in the absence of such direction, by lot.  Redemption by lot shall be in such 
manner  as  the  Paying  Agent  shall  determine;  provided,  however,  that  the  portion  of  any  Bond  to  be 
redeemed in part shall be in the principal amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. 

Notice of Redemption 

When redemption is authorized or required pursuant to the Resolution, the Paying Agent, upon 
written  instruction  from  the  District  given  at  least  60  days  prior  to  the  date  designated  for  such 
redemption,  shall  give  notice  (each,  a  “Redemption  Notice”)  of  the  redemption  of  the  Bonds.    Such 
Redemption Notice shall specify:  (a) the Bonds or designated portions thereof (in the case of any Bond to 
be redeemed in part but not in whole) which are to be redeemed, (b) the date of redemption, (c) the place 
or places where the redemption will be made, including the name and address of the Paying Agent, (d) the 
redemption price, (e) the CUSIP® numbers assigned to the Bonds to be redeemed, (f) the Bond numbers 
of the Bonds to be redeemed in whole or in part and, in the case of any Bond to be redeemed in part only, 
the principal amount of such Bond to be redeemed, and (g) the original issue date, interest rate and stated 
maturity date of each Bond to be redeemed in whole or in part.  Such Redemption Notice shall further 
state that on the  specified date  there  shall become due and payable upon each Bond or portion thereof 
being redeemed the redemption price thereof, and that from and after such date, interest on such Bonds 
shall cease to accrue. 

 
 

7 

 

The Paying Agent shall take the following actions with respect to each such Redemption Notice:  
(i) at least 20 but not more than 45 days prior to the redemption date, such Redemption Notice shall be 
given to the respective Owners of Bonds designated for redemption by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at 
their addresses appearing on the Bond Register; (ii) in the event the Bonds are no longer held in book-
entry-only  form,  at  least  35  but  not  more  than  45  days  before  the  redemption  date,  such  Redemption 
Notice  shall  be  given  by  (1)  first-class  mail,  postage  prepaid,  (2) telephonically  confirmed  facsimile 
transmission, or (3) overnight delivery service, to DTC and any other securities depositories designated 
by the District in accordance with the Resolution; and (iii) in the event the Bonds are no longer held in 
book-entry-only form, at least 35 but not more than 45 days before the redemption date, such Redemption 
Notice  shall  be  given  by  (1)  first-class  mail,  postage  prepaid,  or  (2)  overnight  delivery  service,  to  the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.  

Neither failure to receive any Redemption Notice nor any defect in any such Redemption Notice 
so given shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the redemption of the affected Bonds.  Each 
check issued or other transfer of funds made by the Paying Agent for the purpose of redeeming Bonds 
shall  bear  the  CUSIP  number  identifying,  by  issue  and  maturity,  the  Bonds  being  redeemed  with  the 
proceeds of such check or other transfer. 

Partial Redemption of Bonds 

Upon  the  surrender  of  any  Bond  redeemed  in  part  only,  the  Paying  Agent  shall  execute  and 
deliver to the Owner thereof a new Bond or Bonds of like Series, tenor and maturity and of authorized 
denominations equal in transfer amounts to the unredeemed portion of the Bond surrendered.  Such partial 
redemption shall be valid upon payment of the amount required to be paid to such Owner, and the County 
and  the  District  shall  be  released  and  discharged  thereupon  from  all  liability  to  the  extent  of  such 
payment. 

Effect of Notice of Redemption 

Notice  having  been  given  as  required  in  the  Resolution,  and  the  moneys  for  redemption 
(including the interest to the applicable date of redemption) having been set aside in the District’s Debt 
Service Fund or a designated escrow account, the Bonds to be redeemed shall become due and payable on 
such date of redemption. 

If on such redemption date, money for the redemption of all the Bonds to be redeemed, together 
with interest to such redemption date, shall be held by the Paying Agent so as to be available therefor on 
such redemption date, and if notice of redemption thereof shall have been given, then from and after such 
redemption date, interest on the Bonds to be redeemed shall cease to accrue and become payable. 

Transfer and Exchange 

Any  Bond  may  be  exchanged  for  Bonds  of  like  tenor,  maturity  and  principal  amount  upon 
presentation  and  surrender  at  the  principal  office  of  the  Paying  Agent,  together  with  a  request  for 
exchange signed by the Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the 
Paying Agent.  A Bond may be transferred on the Bond Register only upon presentation and surrender of 
such Bond at the principal office of the Paying Agent together with an assignment executed by the Owner 
or a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Paying Agent.  Upon exchange or 
transfer, the Paying Agent shall complete, authenticate and deliver a new Bond or Bonds of like tenor and 
of any authorized denomination or denominations equal to the principal amount of the Bond surrendered 
and bearing interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date. 

 
 

8 

 

Discharge and Defeasance 

If  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Outstanding  Bonds  shall  be  paid  and  discharged  in  any  one  of  the 

following ways: 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

by paying or causing to be paid the Principal Amount, premium, if any, and interest on 
such Bonds, and when the same become due and payable; 

by depositing with the Paying Agent, in trust, at or before maturity, cash which together 
with  the  amounts  then  on  deposit  in  the  Debt  Service  Fund  (and  the  accounts  therein 
other than amounts that are not available to pay Debt Service) together with the interest 
to accrue thereon without the need for further investment, is fully sufficient to pay such 
Bonds  at  maturity 
thereon, 
interest 
notwithstanding that any Bonds shall not have been surrendered for payment; or 

including  any  premium  and  all 

thereof, 

by  depositing  with  an  institution  that  meets  the  requirements  of  serving  as  successor 
Paying Agent pursuant to such Resolution selected by the District, in trust, lawful money 
or  noncallable  direct  obligations  issued  by  the  United  States  Treasury  (including  State 
and  Local  Government  Series)  or  obligations  which  are  unconditionally  guaranteed  by 
the  United  States  of  America  and  permitted  under  Section 149(b)  of  the  Code  and 
Regulations which, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, will not impair 
the  exclusion  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  of  interest  on  the 
Bonds, in such amount as  will, together with the interest  to accrue  thereon  without the 
need for further investment, be fully sufficient to pay and discharge all Bonds outstanding 
and designated for defeasance at maturity or earlier redemption thereof, for which notice 
has  been  given  or  provided  for,  including  any  premium  and  all  interest  thereon, 
notwithstanding that any Bonds shall not have been surrendered for payment; 

then all obligations of the District and the Paying Agent under the Resolution with respect to the affected 
Bonds shall cease and terminate, except only the obligation of the Paying Agent to pay or cause to be paid 
to the Owners of such Bonds all sums due thereon, and the obligation of the District to pay the Paying 
Agent amounts owing to the Paying Agent under the Resolution. 

Book-Entry-Only System 

The  Bonds  will  be  issued  under  a  book-entry  system,  evidencing  ownership  of  the  Bonds  in 
principal amounts of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof, with no physical distribution of Bonds made to 
the public.  DTC will act as depository for the Bonds, which will be immobilized in their custody.  The 
Bonds  will  be  registered  in  the  name  of  Cede  &  Co.,  as  nominee  for  DTC.    For  further  information 
regarding DTC and the book-entry system, see APPENDIX E hereto.

exteriors  to  minimize  water  use  and  increase  flexibility  in  outdoor  learning;  furnish  outdoor  learning 
spaces, as appropriate. 

The Refunding 

The net proceeds of the sale of the Refunding Bonds will be used to effect an advance refunding 
of  the  Refunded  Bonds  and  to  provide  for  the  costs  of  issuance  of  the  Refunding  Bonds.    On  the 
redemption date, amounts available under the Escrow Agreement will be applied to the redemption price 
of the Refunded Bonds.  

The Escrow Agreement provides for the investment of a portion of the proceeds of the Refunding 
Bonds prior to the redemption date either in State and Local Government Series Securities issued by the 
Treasury  of  the  United  States  of  America  or  in  certain  other  government  obligations  purchased  in  the 
open  market.    The  sufficiency  of  amounts  and  investment  earnings  on  deposit  under  the  Escrow 
Agreement and to be paid with respect to the Refunded Bonds will be verified by the Verification Agent.  
See “VERIFICATION” herein.

General 

SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS 

The Bonds are general obligations of the District, and the Board of Supervisors of the County has 
the  power  and  is  obligated  to  levy  and  collect  ad  valorem  taxes  upon  all  property  within  the  District 
subject  to  taxation  by  the  County,  without  limitation  as  to  rate  or  amount  (except  certain  personal 
property which is taxable at limited rates) for payment of both principal of and interest on the Bonds.   

Subsequent  to  the  issuance  of  the  Series  A  Bonds,  $11,885,000  will  remain  for  issuance  of 

additional general obligation bonds under the Authorization.   

All general obligation bonds of the District are issued on a parity with one another.   

Assessed Valuations 

The assessed valuation of property in the District is established by the County Assessor, except 
for public utility property which is assessed by the State Board of Equalization.  Assessed valuations are 
reported  at  100%  of  the  full  value  of  the  property,  as  defined  in  Article  XIIIA  of  the  California 
Constitution.  See  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  LIMITATIONS  ON  TAXES  AND 
APPROPRIATIONS” herein.  

The  State-reimbursed  exemption  currently  provides  a  credit  of  $7,000  of  the  full  value  of  an 
owner-occupied  dwelling  for  which  application  has  been  made  to  the  County  Assessor.    The  revenue 
estimated  to  be  lost  to  local  taxing  agencies  due  to  the  exemption  is  reimbursed  from  State  sources.  
Reimbursement is based upon total taxes due upon such exempt value and is not reduced by any amount 
for estimated or actual delinquencies. 

In  addition,  certain  classes  of  property  such  as  churches,  colleges,  not-for-profit  hospitals  and 
charitable  institutions  are  exempt  from  property  taxation  and  do  not  appear  on  the  tax  rolls.    No 
reimbursement is made by the State for such exemptions. 

Economic and other factors beyond the District’s control, such as a general market decline in land 
values, reclassification of property to a class exempt from taxation, whether by ownership or use (such as 
exemptions for property owned by State and local agencies and property used for qualified educational, 
hospital,  charitable  or  religious  purposes),  or  the  complete  or  partial  destruction  of  taxable  property 
caused by natural or manmade disaster such as earthquake, flood, fire, drought, toxic dumping, etc., could 
cause  a  reduction  in  the  assessed  value  of  taxable  property  within  the  District  and  necessitate  a 
corresponding increase in the annual tax rate to be levied to pay the principal and interest on the District’s 
outstanding general obligation bonds, including the Bonds. 

On January 17, 2014, the Governor declared a State-wide Drought State of Emergency.  As of 
such  date,  the  State  faces  water  shortfalls  due  to  the  driest  year  in  recorded  State  history;  California’s 
river and reservoirs were below their record low levels, and manual and electronic readings recorded the 
water content of snowpack at the highest elevations in the State (chiefly in the Sierra Nevada mountain 
range)  at  about  20%  of  normal  average  for  the  winter  season.    As  part  of  his  State  of  Emergency 
declaration,  the  Governor  directed  State  officials  to  assist  agricultural  producers  and  communities  that 
may be economically impacted by dry conditions.  Following the Governor’s declaration, the California 
State Water Resources Control Board (the “Water Board”) issued a statewide notice of water shortages 
and  potential  future  curtailment  of  water  right  diversions.    On  April  1,  2015,  the  Governor  issued  an 

 
 

13 

 

executive order mandating certain conservation measures, including a requirement that the Water Board 
impose restrictions to achieve a statewide 25% reduction in urban water usage through February 28, 2016.  

The  District  cannot  make  any  representation  regarding  the  effects  that  the  current  drought  has 
had, or, if it should continue, may have on the value of taxable property within the District, or to what 
extent the drought could cause disruptions to economic activity within the boundaries of the District. 

The  District’s  fiscal  year  2014-15  total  assessed  valuation  of  property  within  its  boundaries  is 
$1,176,621,514.    Shown  in  the  following  tables  are  the  assessed  valuations  of  property  in  the  District 
during the past seven fiscal years, fiscal year 2014-15 assessed valuation and parcels by land use and the 
twenty largest secured taxpayers in the District for fiscal year 2014-15.

Taxes are levied for each fiscal year on taxable real and personal property which is situated in the 
County as of the preceding January 1.  However, upon a change in ownership of property or completion 
of  new  construction,  State  law  permits  an  accelerated  recognition  and  taxation  of  increases  in  real 
property assessed valuation (known as a “floating lien date”).  For assessment and collection purposes, 
property is classified either as “secured” or “unsecured” and is listed accordingly on separate parts of the 
assessment roll.  The “secured roll” is that part of the assessment roll containing State assessed property 
secured by a lien which is sufficient, in the opinion of the assessor, to secure payment of the taxes.  Other 
property is assessed on the “unsecured roll.” 

The County levies a 1% property tax on behalf of all taxing agencies in the County.  The taxes 
collected are allocated on the basis of a formula established by State law enacted in 1979.  Under this 
formula, the County and all other taxing entities receive a base year allocation plus an allocation on the 
basis  of  “situs”  growth  in  assessed  value  (new  construction,  change  of  ownership,  inflation)  prorated 
among the jurisdictions which serve the tax rate areas within which the growth occurs.  Tax rate areas are 
specifically defined geographic areas which were developed to permit the levying of taxes for less than 
county-wide or less than city-wide special and school districts.  In addition, the County levies and collects 
additional approved property taxes and assessments on behalf of any taxing agency within the County. 

Property taxes on the secured roll are due in two installments on November 1 and February 1.  If 
unpaid, such taxes become delinquent after December 10 and April 10, respectively, then a ten percent 
penalty  attaches  to  any  delinquent  payment.    In  addition,  property  on  the  secured  roll  with  respect  to 

 
 

16 

 

which taxes are delinquent is declared tax-defaulted on or about June 30.  Such property may thereafter be 
redeemed  by  payment  of  the  delinquent  taxes  and  the  delinquency  penalty,  plus  costs  and  redemption 
penalty of one and one-half percent per month to the time of redemption.  If taxes are unpaid for a period 
of five years or more, the tax-defaulted property is subject to sale by the Treasurer. 

Property taxes on the unsecured roll are currently due as of the January 1 lien date prior to the 
commencement of a fiscal year and become delinquent, if unpaid, on August 31.  A ten percent penalty 
attaches to delinquent taxes on property on the unsecured roll and an additional penalty of one and one-
half percent per month begins to accrue on November 1.  The taxing authority has four ways of collecting 
unsecured personal property taxes:  (1) a civil action against the taxpayer; (2) filing a certificate in the 
office of the County Clerk specifying certain facts in order to obtain a judgment lien on certain property 
of the taxpayer; (3) filing a certificate of delinquency for recordation in the County Recorder’s office in 
order to obtain a lien on certain property of the taxpayer; and (4) seizure and sale of personal property, 
improvements, bank accounts or possessory interests belonging or assessed to the taxpayer. 

The County levies and collects all property taxes for property falling within its taxing boundaries. 

Tax Charges and Delinquencies   

The County’s secured tax roll charges and corresponding delinquencies with respect to property 
located in the District for the five-year period from fiscal year 2009-10 through 2013-14 are set forth in

Teeter Plan 

The County has adopted the alternative method of secured property tax apportionment available 
under Chapter 3, Part 8, Division 1 (commencing with Section 4701) of the Revenue and Taxation Code 
of the State (also known as the “Teeter Plan”).  This alternative method provides for funding each taxing 
entity included in the Teeter Plan with its total secured property taxes during the year the taxes are levied, 
including  any  amount  uncollected  at  fiscal  year-end.    Under  the  Teeter  Plan,  the  County  assumes  an 
obligation  under  a  debenture  or  similar  demand  obligation  to  advance  funds  to  cover  expected 
delinquencies, and, by such financing, its general fund receives the full amount of secured property taxes 
levied each year and, therefore, no longer experiences delinquent taxes.  In addition, the County’s general 

 
 

17 

 

fund benefits from future collections of penalties and interest on all delinquent taxes collected on behalf 
of participants in this alternative method of apportionment. 

Upon  adopting  the  Teeter  Plan,  the  County  was  required  to  distribute  to  participating  local 
agencies 95% of the then-accumulated, secured roll property tax delinquencies and to place the remaining 
5%  in  a  tax  losses  reserve  fund.    Taxing  entities  that  maintain  funds  in  the  County  Treasury  are  all 
included  in  the  Teeter  Plan;  other  taxing  entities  may  elect  to  be  included  in  the  Teeter  Plan.    Taxing 
entities that do not elect to participate in the Teeter Plan will be paid as taxes are collected.  Since the 
District maintains funds in the County Treasury, the District is included in the Teeter Plan. 

The Teeter Plan is to remain in effect unless the Board of Supervisors of the County orders its 
discontinuance or unless, prior to the commencement of any fiscal year of the County (which commences 
on July 1), the Board of Supervisors shall receive a petition for its discontinuance joined in by resolutions 
adopted by two-thirds of the participating revenue districts in the County, in which event the Board of 
Supervisors  is  to  order  discontinuance  of  the  Teeter  Plan  effective  at  the  commencement  of  the 
subsequent  fiscal  year.    In  the  event  that  the  Teeter  Plan  were  terminated,  receipt  of  revenue  of  ad 
valorem  taxes  in  the  District  would  depend  upon  the  collections  of  the  ad valorem  property  taxes  and 
delinquency rates experienced with respect to the parcels within the District.  The District knows of no 
consideration by the County to discontinue the Teeter Plan.

Certain Existing Obligations 

On March 2, 2004, an election was held at which more than fifty-five percent of the voters of the 
District  approved  general  obligation  bonds,  which  authorized  the  issuance  and  sale  of  $11  million  in 
general obligation bonds (the “2004 Authorization”).  In 2004, the District issued its General Obligation 
Bonds, Election of 2004, Series 2004A in the initial aggregate  amount of $5,059,348.30.  In 2008, the 
District issued its General Obligation Bonds, Election of 2004, Series 2008 in the aggregate initial amount 
of  $5,059,874.20.    $880,777.50  of  the  2004  Authorization  remains.  Bonds  issued  under  the  2004 
Authorization are payable on a parity with the Bonds.

CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LIMITATIONS 

ON TAXES AND APPROPRIATIONS 

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution 

Article  XIIIA  of  the  California  Constitution  limits  the  amount  of  any  ad  valorem  tax  on  real 
property, to one percent (1%) of the full cash value thereof, except that additional ad valorem taxes may 

 
 

20 

 

be levied to pay debt service on indebtedness approved by the voters prior to July 1, 1978 and on bonded 
indebtedness  for  the  acquisition  or  improvement  of  real  property  which  has  been  approved  on  or  after 
July 1, 1978 by two-thirds of the voters on such indebtedness.  Article XIIIA defines full cash value to 
mean “the county assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975-76 tax bill under “full cash 
value,” or thereafter, the appraised value of real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change 
in ownership have occurred after the 1975 assessment.”  The full cash value may be increased at a rate not 
to exceed two percent per year to account for inflation. 

Article XIIIA has subsequently been amended to permit reduction of the “full cash value” base in 
the  event  of  declining  property  values  caused  by  damage,  destruction  or  other  factors,  to  provide  that 
there  would  be  no  increase  in  the  “full  cash  value”  base  in  the  event  of  reconstruction  of  property 
damaged or destroyed in a disaster and in other minor or technical ways. 

Legislation Implementing Article XIIIA 

Legislation  has  been  enacted  and  amended  a  number  of  times  since  1978  to  implement 
Article XIIIA.  Under current law, local agencies are no longer permitted to levy directly any property tax 
(except to pay voter-approved indebtedness).  The one percent (1%) property tax is automatically levied 
by the county and distributed according to a formula among taxing agencies.  The formula apportions the 
tax roughly in proportion to the relative shares of taxes levied prior to 1979. 

Increases of assessed valuation resulting from reappraisals of property due to new construction, 
change  in  ownership  or  from  the  two  percent  annual  adjustment  are  allocated  among  the  various 
jurisdictions in the “taxing area” based upon their respective “situs.”  Any such allocation made to a local 
agency continues as part of its allocation in future years. 

All taxable property is shown at full market value on the tax rolls, with tax rates expressed as $1 
per  $100  of  taxable  value.    All  taxable  property  value  included  in  this  Official  Statement  is  shown  at 
100% of market value (unless noted differently) and all tax rates reflect the $1 per $100 of taxable value. 

Article XIIIB of the California Constitution 

Under Article XIIIB of the California State Constitution state and local government entities have 
an  annual  “appropriations  limit”  and  are  not  permitted  to  spend  certain  moneys  which  are  called 
“appropriations  subject  to  limitation”  (consisting  of  tax  revenues,  state  subventions  and  certain  other 
funds)  in  an  amount  higher  than  the  “appropriations  limit.”    Article  XIIIB  does  not  affect  the 
appropriations of moneys which are excluded from the definition of “appropriations subject to limitation,” 
including  debt  service  on  indebtedness  existing  or  authorized  as  of  January 1,  1979,  or  bonded 
indebtedness subsequently approved by the voters.  In general terms, the “appropriations limit” is to be 
based  on  certain  1978-79  expenditures,  and  is  to  be  adjusted  annually  to  reflect  changes  in  consumer 
prices, populations, and services provided by these entities.  Among other provisions of Article XIIIB, if 
these entities’ revenues in any year exceed the amounts permitted to be spent, the excess would have to be 
returned by revising tax rates or fee schedules over the subsequent two years. 

Unitary Property 

Assembly Bill 454 (Chapter 921, Statutes of 1986) (“AB 454”) provides that  revenues derived 
from most utility property assessed by the State Board of Equalization (“Unitary Property”) are allocated 
as follows:  (1) each jurisdiction will receive up to 102% of its prior year State-assessed revenue; and (2) 
if county-wide revenues  generated from Unitary Property are less than  the previous  year’s revenues or 
greater than 102% of the previous year’s revenues, each jurisdiction will share the burden of the shortfall 

 
 

21 

 

or excess revenues by a specified formula.  This provision applies to all Unitary Property except railroads, 
whose valuation will continue to be allocated to individual tax rate areas. 

The  provisions  of  AB  454  do  not  constitute  an  elimination  of  the  assessment  of  any  State-
assessed properties nor a revision of the methods of assessing utilities by the State Board of Equalization.  
Generally,  AB 454  allows  valuation  growth  or  decline  of  Unitary  Property  to  be  shared  by  all 
jurisdictions in a county. 

California Lottery 

In 1984, the voters of the State approved a Constitutional Amendment establishing a California 
State Lottery (the “State Lottery”), the net revenues (revenues less expenses and prizes) of which shall be 
used to supplement other moneys allocated to public education.  The legislation further requires that the 
funds shall be used for the education of pupils and students and cannot be used for the acquisition of real 
property, the construction of facilities or the financing of research. 

Allocation  of  State  Lottery  net  revenues  is  based  upon  the  average  daily  attendance  of  each 
school and community college district; however, the exact allocation formula may vary from year to year.  
At this time, the amount of additional revenues that may be generated by the State Lottery in any given 
year cannot be predicted. 

Proposition 46 

On  June 3,  1986,  California  voters  approved  Proposition  46,  which  added  an  additional 
exemption to the 1% tax limitation imposed by Article XIIIA.  Under this amendment to Article XIIIA, 
local governments and school and community college districts may increase the property tax rate above 
1% for the period necessary to retire new, general obligation bonds, if two-thirds of those voting in a local 
election approve the issuance of such bonds and the money raised through the sale of the bonds is used 
exclusively to purchase or improve real property. 

Proposition 39 

On November 7, 2000, California voters approved Proposition 39, called the  “Smaller Classes, 
Safer Schools and Financial Accountability Act” (the “Smaller Classes Act”) which amends Section 1 of 
Article XIIIA,  Section  18  of  Article  XVI  of  the  California  Constitution  and  Section  47614  of  the 
California  Education  Code  and  allows  an  alternative  means  of  seeking  voter  approval  for  bonded 
indebtedness  by  55%  of  the  vote,  rather  than  the  two-thirds  majority  required  under  Section  18  of 
Article XVI of the Constitution.  The 55% voter requirement applies only if the bond measure submitted 
to the voters includes, among other items: (1) a restriction that the proceeds of the bonds may be used for 
“the  construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,  or  replacement  of  school  facilities,  including  the 
furnishing  and  equipping  of  school  facilities,  or  the  acquisition  or  lease  of  real  property  for  school 
facilities,” (2) a list of projects to be funded and a certification that the school district board has evaluated 
“safety,  class  size  reduction,  and  information  technology  needs  in  developing  that  list”  and  (3)  that 
annual,  independent  performance  and  financial  audits  will  be  conducted  regarding  the  expenditure  and 
use of the bond proceeds. 

Section 1(b)(3) of Article XIIIA has been added to exempt the one percent (1%) ad valorem tax 
limitation that Section 1(a) of Article XIIIA of the Constitution levies, to pay bonds approved by 55% of 
the voters, subject to the restrictions explained above.

The  State  Legislature  enacted  AB  1908,  Chapter  44,  which  became  effective  upon  passage  of 
Proposition 39 and amends various sections of the Education Code.  Under amendments to Section 15268 
and 15270 of the Education Code, the following limits on ad valorem taxes apply in any single election:  
(1) for an elementary and high school district, indebtedness shall not exceed $30 per $100,000 of taxable 
property,  (2)  for  a  unified  school  district,  indebtedness  shall  not  exceed  $60  per  $100,000  of  taxable 
property,  and  (3)  for  a  community  college  district,  indebtedness  shall  not  exceed  $25 per  $100,000 of 
taxable property.  Finally, AB 1908 requires that a citizens’ oversight committee must be appointed who 
will review the use of the bond funds and inform the public about their proper usage. 

Proposition 98 

On  November  8,  1988,  voters  approved  Proposition  98,  a  combined  initiative,  constitutional 
amendment  and  statute  called  the  “Classroom  Instructional  Improvement  and  Accountability  Act” 
(“Proposition 98”).  Proposition 98 guarantees K-14 schools a minimum share of the State General Fund 
revenues.  Under Proposition 98 (as modified by Proposition 111, which was enacted on June 5, 1990), 
K-14 schools are guaranteed the greater of (a)  40.9% of State General Fund revenues (the “first test”), or 
(b) the amount appropriated to K-14 schools in the prior year, adjusted for changes in the cost-of-living 
(measured as in Article XIIIB by reference to per capita personal income) and enrollment (the “second 
test”), or (c) a “third test” which would replace the second test in any year when the percentage growth in 
per  capita  State  General  Fund  revenues  from  the  prior  year  plus  1/2  of  1%  is  less  than  the  percentage 
growth in the State per capita personal income.  Under the third test, schools would receive the amount 
appropriated  in  the  prior  year  adjusted  for  changes  in  enrollment  and  per  capita  State  General  Fund 
revenues, plus an additional small adjustment factor.  If the third test is used in any year, the difference 
between the third test  and the second test  would become a “credit” to schools which would be paid in 
future years when State General Fund revenue growth exceeds personal income growth. 

Proposition  98  permits  the  Legislature  by  two-thirds  vote  of  both  houses,  with  the  Governor’s 
concurrence,  to  suspend  this  minimum  funding  formula  for  a  one-year  period,  and  any  corresponding 
reduction  in  funding  for  that  year  will  not  be  paid  in  subsequent  years.    However,  in  determining  the 
funding  level  for  the  succeeding  year,  the  formula  base  for  the  prior  year  will  be  reinstated  as  if  such 
suspension had not taken place.  The Legislature has suspended payment on a number of occasions since 
voters approved Proposition 98.  

Proposition  98  also  changes  how  tax  revenues  in  excess  of  the  State  Appropriations  Limit  are 
distributed.    “Excess”  tax  revenues  are  determined  based  on  a  two-year  cycle,  so  that  the  State  could 
avoid having to return to taxpayers excess tax revenues in one year if its appropriations in the next fiscal 
year were under its limit.  After any two-year period, if there are excess State tax revenues, 50% of the 
excess would be transferred to K-14 schools, with the balance returned to taxpayers.  Further, any excess 
State tax revenues transferred to K-14 schools are not built into the school districts’ base expenditures for 
calculating their entitlement for State aid in the next year, and the State’s appropriations limit will not be 
increased by this amount. 

Proposition 30 

On November 6, 2012, voters approved Proposition 30, also referred to as the “Temporary Taxes 
to  Fund  Education,  Guaranteed  Local  Public  Safety  Funding,  Initiative  Constitutional  Amendment.”  
Proposition 30 (1) increases the personal income tax on certain of the State’s income taxpayers by one to 
three percent for a period of seven years beginning with the 2012 tax year and ending with the 2019 tax 
year, and (2) increases the sales and use tax by one-quarter percent for a period of four years beginning on 
January 1, 2013 and ending with the 2016 tax year. The revenues generated from such tax increases are 
included in the calculation of the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee.  

 
 

23 

 

The  revenues  generated  from  such  temporary  tax  increases  are  deposited  into  a  State  account 
created pursuant to Proposition 30 designated the Education Protection Account, and 89% of the amounts 
therein  are  allocated  to  school  districts  and  11%  of  the  amounts  therein  are  allocated  to  community 
college districts. The governing board of each school district and community college district is granted 
sole authority to determine how the moneys received from the Education Protection Account are spent, 
provided;  however,  the  governing  board  is  required  to  hold  public  hearing  when  making  spending 
decisions and publish annual reports online explaining how the money was spent.   

The District cannot predict the effect the loss of the revenues generated from such temporary tax 
increases  will  have  on  total  State  revenues  and  the  effect  on  the  Proposition  98  formula  for  funding 
schools. 

Proposition 2 

On November 4, 2014, voters approved Proposition 2, also referred to as the “Rainy Day Budget 
Stabilization  Fund  Act.”    Proposition  2  changed  the  State’s  existing  requirements  for  the  Budget 
Stabilization Account (“BSA”) and establishes a Public School System Stabilization Account (“PSSSA”).  

Proposition  2  limits  the  ability  of  the  Governor  to  suspend  or  reduce  transfers  to  the  BSA. 
Specifically, the Governor would have to declare a “budget emergency,” defined in Article XIIB of the 
State Constitution or determine that there are insufficient resources to maintain general fund expenditures 
for  the  current  year,  at  the  highest  level  of  spending  in  the  three  most  recent  fiscal  years.  Any  such 
declaration must be followed by a legislative bill passed by a majority vote of each house.   

Proposition  2  also  requires  the  State  Controller  to  deposit  annually  1.5  %  of  general  fund 
revenues  and  an  amount  equal  to  revenues  derived  from  capital  gains-related  taxes  in  situations  where 
such tax revenues are in excess of 8% of general fund revenues.  Deposits to the BSA are expected to 
begin no later than October 1, 2015, and such deposits will be made until the BSA balance reaches an 
amount  equal  to  10%  of  general  fund  revenues.    Additionally,  from  2015-16  to  2029-30,  half  of  any 
required transfers to the BSA must be allocated to reduce certain state liabilities, such as unfunded state-
level pension plans and making certain payments owed to K-14 school districts.   

The PSSSA will be funded by the capital gains-related tax revenues in excess of 8% of general 
fund  revenues.    The  State  may  deposit  amounts  into  the  PSSSA only  after  certain  conditions  are  met, 
including  the  payment  of  all  amounts  owing  to  school  districts  under  the  Proposition  98  maintenance 
factor and the existence of a “Test 1” year under Proposition 98. 

Article XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution 

On November 5, 1996, an initiative to amend the State Constitution known as the “Right to Vote 
on  Taxes  Act”  (“Proposition  218”)  was  approved  by  a  majority  of  California  voters.    Proposition 218 
added  Articles  XIIIC  and  XIIID  to  the  State  Constitution  and  requires  majority  voter  approval  for  the 
imposition, extension or increase of general taxes and 2/3 voter approval for the imposition, extension or 
increase of special taxes by a local government, which is defined in Proposition 218 to include counties.  
Proposition 218 also provides that any general tax imposed, extended or increased without voter approval 
by any local government on or after January 1, 1995, and prior to November 6, 1996 shall continue to be 
imposed only if approved by a majority vote in an election held within two years following November 6, 
1996.  All local taxes and benefit assessments which may be imposed by public agencies will be defined 
as “general taxes” (defined as those used for general governmental purposes) or “special taxes” (defined 
as taxes for a specific purpose even if the revenues flow through  the  local  government’s general fund) 
both of which would require a popular vote.  New general taxes require a majority vote and new special 

 
 

24 

 

taxes require a two-thirds vote.  Proposition 218 also extends the initiative power to reducing or repealing 
local  taxes,  assessments,  fees  and  charges,  regardless  of  the  date  such  taxes,  assessments  or  fees  or 
charges  were  imposed,  and  lowers  the  number  of  signatures  necessary  for  the  process.    In  addition, 
Proposition 218 limits the application of assessments, fees and charges and requires them to be submitted 
to property owners for approval or rejection, after notice and public hearing. 

The  District  has  no  power  to  impose  taxes  except  property  taxes  associated  with  a  general 
obligation bond election, following approval by 55% or 2/3 of the District’s voters, depending upon the 
Article  of  the  Constitution  under  which  it  is  passed.    Under  previous  law,  the  District  could  apply 
provisions  of  the  Landscape  and  Lighting  Act  of  1972  to  create  an  assessment  district  for  specified 
purposes, based on the absence of a majority protest.  Proposition 218 significantly reduces the ability of 
the  District  to  create  such  special  assessment  districts.    Any  assessments,  fees  or  charges  levied  or 
imposed  by  any  assessment  district  created  by  the  District  will  become  subject  to  the  election 
requirements of Proposition 218 as described above, a more elaborate notice and balloting process and 
other requirements. 

Proposition 218 also expressly extends the initiative power to give voters the power to reduce or 
repeal local taxes, assessments, fees and charges, regardless of the date such taxes, assessments, fees or 
charges  were  imposed,  and  reduces  the  number  of  signatures  required  for  the  initiative  process.    This 
extension  of  the  initiative  power  to  some  extent  constitutionalizes  the  March 6,  1995,  State  Supreme 
Court decision in Rossi v. Brown, which upheld an initiative that repealed a local tax and held that the 
State constitution does not preclude the repeal, including the prospective repeal, of a tax ordinance by an 
initiative, as contrasted with the State constitutional prohibition on referendum powers regarding statutes 
and. ordinances which impose a tax.  Generally, the initiative process enables California voters to enact 
legislation  upon  obtaining  requisite  voter  approval  at  a  general  election.    Proposition  218  extends  the 
authority  stated  in  Rossi  v.  Brown  by  expanding  the  initiative  power  to  include  reducing  or  repealing 
assessments,  fees  and  charges,  which  had  previously  been  considered  administrative  rather  than 
legislative matters and therefore beyond the initiative power.  This extension of the initiative power is not 
limited by the terms of Proposition 218 to fees imposed after November 6, 1996, and absent other legal 
authority could result in retroactive reduction in any existing taxes, assessments or fees and charges. Such 
legal authority could include the limitations imposed on the impairment of contracts under the contract 
clause of the United States Constitution. 

Proposition 218 has no effect upon the District’s ability to pursue approval of a general obligation 
bond  issue  or  a  Mello-Roos  Community  Facilities  District  bond  issue  in  the  future,  both  of  which  are 
already subject to a 2/3 vote, although certain procedures and burdens of proof may be altered slightly.  
The District is unable to predict the nature of any future challenges to Proposition 218 or the extent to 
which, if any, Proposition 218 may be held to be unconstitutional. 

Future Initiatives 

Article XIIIA, Article XIIIB, Article XIIIC, Article XIIID and Propositions 98, 46 and 39 were 
each adopted as measures that qualified for the ballot pursuant to the State’s initiative process.  From time 
to time, other initiative measures could be adopted, further affecting the District’s revenues or their ability 
to expend revenues. 

THE KERN COUNTY TREASURY POOL 

The following information concerning the Kern County Treasury Pool (the “Investment Pool” or 
“Pool”) has been provided by the Treasurer and has not been confirmed or verified by the District or the 
Original  Purchaser.    No  representation  is  made  herein  as  to  the  accuracy  or  adequacy  of  such 

 
 

25 

information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date 
hereof or that the information contained or incorporated hereby by reference is correct as of any time 
subsequent to its date. 

Under the California Education Code, the District is required to pay all moneys received from any 
source into the County of Kern Treasury to be held on behalf of the District.  The Pool consists of monies 
deposited with the  Treasurer by County departments and agencies,  school districts, certain non-County 
governmental agencies and  special  assessment districts.  Most of the Pool’s depositors are required by 
State law to invest their excess moneys in the Pool.   

Each depositor is assigned a distinct fund number within the Investment Pool.  Cash represented 
by the  fund  balances  is  commingled  in  a  Pooled  Cash  Portfolio for  investment  purposes;  no  funds  are 
segregated  for  separate  investment.    Investments  are  selected  from  those  authorized  by  California 
Government  Code  Section  53635.  Authorized  investments  include  obligations  of  the  United  States 
Treasury, agencies of the United States government, federally sponsored enterprises, local and State bond 
issues, bankers acceptances, commercial paper of prime quality, collateralized and negotiable certificates 
of  deposit,  repurchase  and  reverse  repurchase  agreements,  medium  term  corporate  notes,  shares  of 
beneficial  interest  in  diversified  management  companies  (mutual  funds),  and  asset  backed  (including 
mortgage related) and pass-through securities. 

Each  calendar  year,  the  Treasurer  prepares  an  Annual  Statement  of  Investment  Policy  (the 
“Investment Policy”) that sets the framework for the investment practices relating to the County treasury. 
Legislation enacted in 1996 and effective January 1, 1997, requires that the Investment Policy be filed and 
approved  by  the  Board  in  open  session.    Additionally,  the  Board  must  determine  whether  to  delegate 
investment authority to the Treasurer each year.  Failure to so delegate transfers investment responsibility 
to the Board itself.  The Board of Supervisors approved the current Investment Policy as presented by the 
Treasurer and delegated investment responsibility to the Treasurer on December 2, 2014.  Having been so 
approved, the Investment Policy may not be changed without Board approval. 

The approved Investment Policy provides that the County’s investment objectives are “safety and 
liquidity  of  all  investments,  while  obtaining  a  reasonable  return  within  established  investment 
guidelines.”    The  Investment  Policy  provides  that  no  more  than  6%  of  the  assets  in  the  Pool  can  be 
invested in the securities of any single issuer other than the United States Treasury and agencies of the 
United States government. Investments in reverse repurchase agreements are limited to 10% of the total 
Pool and must always be matched in maturity to the reinvestment.  Additionally, no investment will be 
made in any security whose coupon rate varies inversely with general credit market rates. 

In  accordance  with  California  law,  the  Kern  County  Board  of  Supervisors  created  an  eleven-
member Treasury Oversight Committee (the “TOC”) on April 2, 1996.  The statutory role of the TOC is 
to review the Investment Policy as prepared by the Treasurer and make recommendations to the Board, to 
monitor policy compliance as well as investment performance and to cause an annual independent audit 
to be performed.  The TOC meets semi-annually to accomplish its tasks. 

The  following  tables  present  information  with  respect  to  the  Pool  as  of  March  31,  2015.    As 
described above, a wide range of investments is authorized under State law and the  Investment Policy. 
Therefore, there can be no assurance that the investments in the Pool will not vary significantly from the 
investments described below.  In addition, the value of various investments in the Pool will fluctuate on a 
daily basis as a result of several factors, including generally prevailing interest rates and other economic 
conditions.    For  further  information  concerning  County  investments,  access  the  County’s  website:

None of the District, the Financial Advisor or the Original Purchaser has made an independent 
investigation of the investments in the Pool nor have they made any assessment of the current County 
Investment Policy.  The value of the various investments in the Pool will fluctuate on a daily basis as a 
result  of  a  multitude  of  factors,  including  generally  prevailing  interest  rates  and  other  economic 
conditions.  Additionally, the Treasurer, with the consent of the Treasury Oversight Committee and the 
County Board of Supervisors, may change the County Investment Policy at any time.  Therefore, there 
can be no assurance that the values of the various investments in the Pool will not vary significantly from 
the values described herein. 

LEGAL OPINION 

The  legal  opinion  of  Nixon  Peabody  LLP,  Bond  Counsel  to  the  District  (“Bond  Counsel”), 
attesting to the  validity of the Bonds, will be supplied to the original purchasers of the  Bonds without 
charge.    A  copy  of  the  legal  opinion  will  be  delivered  with  the  Bonds.    Bond  Counsel  will  receive 
compensation contingent upon the sale and delivery of the Bonds. 

TAX MATTERS 

The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), imposes certain requirements that 
must be met subsequent to the issuance and delivery of the Bonds for interest thereon to be and remain 
excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.    Noncompliance  with  such  requirements 
could  cause  the  interest  on  the  Bonds  to  be  included  in  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes 
retroactive to the date of issue of the Bonds.  Pursuant to the Resolution and the Tax and Nonarbitrage 
Certificate executed by the District in connection with the issuance of the Bonds (the “Tax Certificate”), 
the District has covenanted to comply with the applicable requirements of the Code in order to maintain 
the exclusion of the interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes pursuant to 
Section 103 of the Code.  In addition, the District has made certain representations and certifications in 
the Resolution and the Tax Certificate.  Bond Counsel will not independently verify the accuracy of those 
representations and certifications. 

In  the  opinion  of  Nixon  Peabody  LLP,  Bond  Counsel,  under  existing  law  and  assuming 
compliance  with  the  aforementioned  covenant,  and  the  accuracy  of  certain  representations  and 
certifications made by the District described above, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income 
for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code.  Bond Counsel is also of the opinion that 
such interest is not treated as a preference item in calculating the alternative minimum tax imposed under 
the Code with respect to individuals and corporations.  Interest on the Bonds is, however, included in the 

 

28 

 

adjusted current earnings of certain corporations for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax 
imposed on such corporations.  

In rendering these opinions, Bond Counsel has relied upon representations and covenants of the 
District in the Tax Certificate concerning the property financed with Bond proceeds, the investment and 
use of Bond proceeds and the rebate to the federal government of certain earnings thereon.  In addition, 
Bond  Counsel  has  assumed  that  all  such  representations  are  true  and  correct  and  that  the  District  will 
comply with such covenants.  Bond Counsel has expressed no opinion with respect to the exclusion of the 
interest on the Bonds from gross income under Section 103(a) of the Code in the event that any of such 
District representations are untrue or the District fails to comply with such covenants, unless such failure 
to comply is based on the advice or the opinion of Bond Counsel. 

State Taxes 

Bond Counsel is also of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is exempt from personal income 
taxes of the State of California under present State law.  Bond counsel expresses no opinion as to other 
state or local tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds nor as to the taxability of the Bonds or 
the income therefrom under the laws of any state other than California. 

Original Issue Discount 

Bond Counsel is further of the opinion that the difference between the principal amount of the 
Bonds maturing on November 1, 2029 through November 1, 2035, inclusive, and on November 1, 2040 
and on November 1, 2044, inclusive (collectively, the “Discount Bonds”) and the initial offering price to 
the public (excluding bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of 
underwriters  or  wholesalers)  at  which  price  a  substantial  amount  of  such  Discount  Bonds  of  the  same 
maturity  was  sold  constitutes  original  issue  discount  which  is  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal 
income tax purposes to the same extent as interest on the Bonds.  Further, such original issue discount 
accrues actuarially on a constant interest rate basis over the term of each Discount Bond and the basis of 
each Discount Bond acquired at such initial offering price by an initial purchaser thereof will be increased 
by  the  amount  of  such  accrued  original  issue  discount.    The  accrual  of  original  issue  discount  may  be 
taken into account as an increase in the amount of tax-exempt income for purposes of determining various 
other  tax  consequences  of  owning  the  Discount  Bonds,  even  though  there  will  not  be  a  corresponding 
cash  payment.    Owners  of  the  Discount  Bonds  are  advised  that  they  should  consult  with  their  own 
advisors with respect to the state and local tax consequences of owning such Discount Bonds. 

Original Issue Premium 

The Bonds maturing on November 1, 2015 through November 1, 2025, inclusive (collectively, 
the  “Premium  Bonds”)  are  being  offered  at  prices  in  excess  of  their  principal  amounts.    An  initial 
purchaser with an initial adjusted basis in a  Premium Bond in excess of its principal amount will have 
amortizable bond premium which is not deductible from gross income for federal income tax purposes.  
The  amount  of  amortizable  bond  premium  for  a  taxable  year  is  determined  actuarially  on  a  constant 
interest rate basis over the term of each Premium Bond based on the purchaser’s yield to maturity (or, in 
the case of Premium Bonds callable prior to their maturity, over the period to the call date, based on the 
purchaser’s  yield to the call date and giving  effect to any call premium).  For purposes of determining 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of a Premium Bond, an initial purchaser who acquires such 
obligation with an amortizable bond premium is required to decrease such purchaser’s adjusted basis in 
such  Premium  Bond  annually  by  the  amount  of  amortizable  bond  premium  for  the  taxable  year.    The 
amortization  of  bond  premium  may  be  taken  into  account  as  a  reduction  in  the  amount  of  tax-exempt 
income for purposes of determining various other tax consequences of owning such Bonds. Owners of the 

 
 

29 

 

Premium Bonds are advised that they should consult with their own advisors with respect to the state and 
local tax consequences of owning such Premium Bonds. 

Ancillary Tax Matters 

Ownership  of  the  Bonds  may  result  in  other  federal  tax  consequences  to  certain  taxpayers, 
including,  without  limitation,  certain  S  corporations,  foreign  corporations  with  branches  in  the  United 
States,  property  and  casualty  insurance  companies,  individuals  receiving  Social  Security  or  Railroad 
Retirement benefits, and individuals seeking to claim the earned income credit.  Ownership of the Bonds 
may also result in other federal tax consequences to taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred or 
continued indebtedness to purchase or to carry the Bonds.  Prospective investors are advised to consult 
their own tax advisors regarding these rules. 

Interest paid on tax-exempt obligations such as the Bonds is subject to information reporting to 
the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (“IRS”)  in  a  manner  similar  to  interest  paid  on  taxable  obligations.    In 
addition,  interest  on  the  Bonds  may  be  subject  to  backup  withholding  if  such  interest  is  paid  to  a 
registered owner that (a) fails to provide certain identifying information (such as the registered owner’s 
taxpayer identification number) in the manner required by the IRS, or (b) has been identified by the IRS 
as being subject to backup withholding. 

Bond  Counsel  is  not  rendering  any  opinion  as  to  any  federal  tax  matters  other  than  those 
described in the opinion attached as APPENDIX B.  Prospective investors, particularly those who may be 
subject  to  special  rules  described  above,  are  advised  to  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding  the 
federal tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Bonds, as well as any tax consequences arising 
under the laws of any state or other taxing jurisdiction. 

Changes in Law and Post-Issuance Events 

Legislative or administrative actions and court decisions, at either the federal or state level, could 
have an adverse impact on the potential benefits of the exclusion from gross income of the interest on the 
Bonds for federal or state income tax purposes, and thus on the value or marketability of the Bonds.  This 
could result from changes to federal or state income tax rates, changes in the structure of federal or state 
income taxes (including replacement with another type of tax), repeal of the exclusion of the interest on 
the Bonds from gross income for federal or state income tax purposes, or otherwise.  We note that each 
year  since  2011,  the  President  has  released  legislative  proposals  that  would  limit  the  extent  of  the 
exclusion from gross income of interest on obligations of states and political subdivisions under Section 
103 of the Code (including the Bonds) for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain thresholds.  It is not 
possible to predict whether any legislative or administrative actions or court decisions having an adverse 
impact  on  the  federal  or  state  income  tax  treatment  of  holders  of  the  Bonds  may  occur.    Prospective 
purchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding the impact of any change in law 
on the Bonds.  Bond Counsel has not undertaken to advise in the future whether any events after the date 
of issuance and delivery of the Bonds may affect the tax status of interest on the Bonds.  Bond Counsel 
expresses no opinion as to any federal, state or local tax law consequences with respect to the Bonds, or 
the  interest  thereon,  if  any  action  is  taken  with  respect  to  the  Bonds  or  the  proceeds  thereof  upon  the 
advice or approval of other counsel.

Bond Insurance Policy 

BOND INSURANCE 

Concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds, Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. ("AGM") will 
issue  its  Municipal  Bond  Insurance  Policy  for  the  Bonds  (the  "Policy").    The  Policy  guarantees  the 
scheduled  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Bonds  when  due  as  set  forth  in  the  form  of  the 
Policy included as an exhibit to this Official Statement. 

The  Policy  is  not  covered  by  any  insurance  security  or  guaranty  fund  established  under  New 

York, California, Connecticut or Florida insurance law. 

Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp.  

AGM is a New York domiciled financial guaranty insurance company and an indirect subsidiary 
of Assured Guaranty Ltd. (“AGL”), a Bermuda-based holding company whose shares are publicly traded 
and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “AGO”.  AGL, through its operating 
subsidiaries, provides credit enhancement products to the U.S. and global public finance, infrastructure 
and structured finance markets.  Neither AGL nor any of its shareholders or affiliates, other than AGM, is 
obligated to pay any debts of AGM or any claims under any insurance policy issued by AGM.   

AGM’s  financial  strength  is  rated  “AA”  (stable  outlook)  by  Standard  and  Poor’s  Ratings 
Services,  a  Standard  &  Poor’s  Financial  Services  LLC  business  (“S&P”),  “AA+”  (stable  outlook)  by 
Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. (“KBRA”) and “A2” (stable outlook) by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. 
(“Moody’s”).    Each  rating  of  AGM  should  be  evaluated  independently.    An  explanation  of  the 
significance of the above ratings may be obtained from the applicable rating agency.  The above ratings 
are  not  recommendations  to  buy,  sell  or  hold  any  security,  and  such  ratings  are  subject  to  revision  or 
withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, including withdrawal initiated at the request of AGM in its 
sole discretion.  In addition, the rating agencies may at any time change AGM’s long-term rating outlooks 
or place such ratings on a watch list for possible downgrade in the near term.  Any downward revision or 
withdrawal  of  any  of  the  above  ratings,  the  assignment  of  a  negative  outlook  to  such  ratings  or  the 
placement of such ratings on a negative watch list may have an adverse effect on the market price of any 
security guaranteed by AGM.  AGM only guarantees scheduled principal and scheduled interest payments 
payable  by  the  issuer  of  bonds  insured  by  AGM  on  the  date(s)  when  such  amounts  were  initially 
scheduled  to  become  due  and  payable  (subject  to  and  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  relevant 
insurance policy), and does not guarantee the market price or liquidity of the securities it insures, nor does 
it guarantee that the ratings on such securities will not be revised or withdrawn. 

Current Financial Strength Ratings 

On November 13, 2014, KBRA assigned an insurance financial strength rating of “AA+” (stable 

outlook) to AGM.  AGM can give no assurance as to any further ratings action that KBRA may take. 

On July 2, 2014, S&P issued a credit rating report in which it affirmed AGM’s financial strength 
rating of “AA” (stable outlook).  AGM can give no assurance as to any further ratings action that S&P 
may take. 

On  July  2,  2014,  Moody’s  issued  a  rating  action  report  stating  that  it  had  affirmed  AGM’s 
insurance financial strength rating of “A2” (stable outlook).  On February 18, 2015, Moody’s published a 
credit opinion under its new financial guarantor ratings methodology maintaining its existing rating and 
outlook on AGM.  AGM can give no assurance as to any further ratings action that Moody’s may take.

Capitalization of AGM 

At March 31, 2015, AGM’s policyholders’ surplus and contingency reserve were approximately 
$3,730 million and its net unearned premium reserve was approximately $1,702 million. Such amounts 
represent the combined surplus, contingency reserve and net unearned premium reserve of AGM, AGM’s 
wholly  owned  subsidiary  Assured  Guaranty  (Europe)  Ltd.  and  60.7%  of  AGM’s  indirect  subsidiary 
Municipal  Assurance  Corp.;  each  amount  of  surplus,  contingency  reserve  and  net  unearned  premium 
reserve for each company was determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles.

Continuing Disclosure 

LEGAL MATTERS 

In accordance with the requirements of Rule 15c2-12 (the “Rule”) promulgated by the Securities 
and  Exchange  Commission,  the  District  will  enter  into  a  Continuing  Disclosure  Undertaking  (the 
“Continuing Disclosure Undertaking”) in the form of APPENDIX D hereto, on or prior to the sale of the 
Bonds  in  which  the  District  will  undertake,  for  the  benefit  of  the  Beneficial  Owners  of  the  Bonds,  to 
provide certain information as set forth therein.  The covenants contained in the Continuing Disclosure 
Undertaking  have  been  made  to  assist  the  Official  Purchaser  in  complying  with  the  Rule.    See 
APPENDIX D – “FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT” hereto. 

While the District filed its annual reports required by the Rule (each, an “Annual Report”) and 
material event notices, as well as notices of certain listed events specified by the Rule (each, an “Event 
Notice”)  required  pursuant  to  its  previous  continuing  disclosure  obligations  for  the  past  five  years,  the 
District’s audit for fiscal year 2013-14 was filed 26 days late.  

Limitation on Remedies; Amounts Held in the County Treasury Pool 

The opinion of Bond Counsel, the proposed form of which is attached hereto as APPENDIX B, is 
qualified by reference to bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws relating to or affecting creditor’s rights. 
The rights of the Owners of the Bonds are subject to certain limitations.  Enforceability of the rights and 
remedies  of  the  Owners  of  the  Bonds,  and  the  obligations  incurred  by  the  District,  are  limited  by 
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and similar laws relating to or affecting 
the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, now or hereafter in effect, equity principles that may limit 
the  specific  enforcement  under  State  law  of  certain  remedies,  the  exercise  by  the  United  States  of 
America  of  the  powers  delegated  to  it  by  the  Constitution,  the  reasonable  and  necessary  exercise,  in 
certain  exceptional  situations,  of  the  police  powers  inherent  in  the  sovereignty  of  the  State  and  its 
governmental  bodies  in  the  interest  of  serving  a  significant  and  legitimate  public  purpose,  and  the 
limitations  on  remedies  against  school  and  community  college  districts  in  the  State.    Bankruptcy 
proceedings,  if  initiated,  could  subject  the  beneficial  owners  of  the  Bonds  to  judicial  discretion  and 
interpretation  of  their  rights  in  bankruptcy  or  otherwise,  and  consequently  may  entail  risks  of  delay, 
limitation, or modification of their rights. 

Under Chapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) (the “Bankruptcy 
Code”),  which  governs  the  bankruptcy  proceedings  for  public  agencies,  no  involuntary  petitions  for 
bankruptcy  relief  are  permitted.    While  current  State  law  precludes  school  districts  from  voluntarily 
seeking  bankruptcy  relief  under  Chapter  9  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code  without  the  concurrence  of  the 
State, such concurrence could be granted or State law could be amended.   

The Resolution and the State Government Code require the County to annually levy ad valorem 
property taxes upon all property subject to taxation by the District, without limitation as to rate or amount 
(except as to certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates), for the payment of the principal 
of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds. The County on behalf of the District is thus expected to be 
in  possession  of  the  annual  ad  valorem  property  taxes  and  certain  funds  to  repay  the  Bonds  and  may 

 
 

33 

 

invest  these  funds  in  the  County’s  Treasury  Pool,  as  described  above.    In  the  event  the  District  or  the 
County were to go into bankruptcy, a federal bankruptcy court might hold that the Owners of the Bonds 
are  unsecured  creditors  with  respect  to  any  funds  received  by  the  District  or  the  County  prior  to  the 
bankruptcy, which may include taxes that have been collected and deposited into the Debt Service Fund, 
where such amounts are deposited into the County Treasury Pool, and such amounts may not be available 
for payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds unless the owners of the Bonds can “trace” those 
funds. There can be no assurance that the Owners could successfully so “trace” such taxes on deposit in 
the Debt Service Fund where such amounts  are invested in the County  Treasury Pool. Under any such 
circumstances, there could be delays or reductions in payments on the Bonds.  

LEGALITY FOR INVESTMENT 

Under  provisions  of  the  California  Financial  Code,  the  Bonds  are  legal  investments  for 
commercial  banks  in  California  to  the  extent  that  the  Bonds,  in  the  informed  opinion  of  the  investing 
bank,  are  prudent  for  the  investment  of  funds  of  depositors.    Under  provisions  of  the  California 
Government Code, the Bonds are eligible to secure deposits of public moneys in California. 

VERIFICATION  

The sufficiency of amounts and investment earnings on deposit under the Escrow Agreement and 
to  be  paid  with  respect  to  the  Refunded  Bonds  will  be  verified  by  the  Verification  Agent.    The 
Verification Agent will deliver a report to that effect on the date of delivery of the Refunded Bonds. The 
report of the Verification Agent will include the statement that the scope of their engagement was limited 
to verifying the mathematical accuracy of the computations contained in such schedules provided to them 
and that they have no obligation to update their report because of events occurring, or data or information 
coming to their attention, subsequent to the date of their report. 

RATINGS 

The  Bonds  have  been  assigned  a  rating  of  “AA”  from  Standard &  Poor’s  Ratings  Services,  a 
Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC business (“S&P”) with the understanding that, upon delivery 
of  the  Bonds,  the  Policy  will  be  issued.    See  “BOND  INSURANCE”  herein.    S&P  has  assigned  an 
underlying municipal bond rating of “A” to the Bonds.  Such ratings reflect only the views of S&P and an 
explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained as follows:  S&P, 7 World Trade Center 
at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10007, tel. (212) 553-0300.  There is no assurance that 
such  ratings  will  continue  for  any  given  period  of  time  or  that  it  will  not  be  revised  downward  or 
withdrawn  entirely  if,  in  the  judgment  of  the  rating  agency,  circumstances  so  warrant.    Any  such 
downward revision or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the 
Bonds. 

NO LITIGATION 

No litigation is pending concerning the  validity of the Bonds. The District is  not aware of any 
litigation  pending  or  threatened  questioning  the  political  existence  of  the  District  or  contesting  the 
District’s  ability  to  receive  ad  valorem  taxes  or  to  collect  other  revenues  or  contesting  the  District’s 
ability to issue the Bonds. 

Morgan  Stanley  &  Co.  LLC,  as  Original  Purchaser  (the  “Original  Purchaser”),  has  agreed  to 
purchase the Series  A Bonds from the District at the purchase price of $3,043,014.64 (being the initial

is subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Sale. 

The Original Purchaser has also agreed to purchase the Refunding Bonds from the District at the

original  issue  premium  of  $350,054.10,  less  amounts  to  be  used  to  pay  certain  costs  of  issuance  of 
$119,373.91, less an underwriter’s discount of $44,159.27 and less $10,485.29 used to pay the premium 
for  the  Policy),  at  the  rates  and  yields  shown  on  the  inside  cover  hereof.  The  Notice  of  Sale  attached 
hereto as APPENDIX F requires that the Original Purchaser will purchase all of the Refunding Bonds, if 
any are purchased.  The obligation to make such purchase is subject to certain terms and conditions set 
forth in the Notice of Sale. 

Morgan Stanley, parent company of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC., the underwriter of the Bonds, 
has entered into a retail distribution arrangement with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.  As part of the 
distribution  arrangement,  Morgan  Stanley  &  Co.  LLC  may  distribute  municipal  securities  to  retail 
investors through the financial advisor network of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.  As part of this 
arrangement, Morgan  Stanley & Co. LLC may  compensate Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC for its 
selling efforts with respect to the Bonds. 

The Original Purchaser intends to offer the Bonds to the public at the offering prices set forth on 
the inside cover page of this Official  Statement.   The Original Purchaser may,  however,  offer and sell 
Bonds to certain dealers and others at prices lower than the offering prices stated on the inside cover page 
of  this  Official  Statement.    The  offering  prices  may  be  changed  from  time  to  time  by  the  Original 
Purchaser. 

FINANCIAL ADVISOR 

Fieldman, Rolapp & Associates  (the  “Financial  Advisor”)  is  employed as Financial  Advisor to 
the  District  in  connection  with  the  issuance  of  the  Bonds.    The  Financial  Advisor’s  fee  for  services 
rendered with respect to the sale of the Bonds is contingent upon the issuance and delivery of the Bonds. 
Fieldman, Rolapp & Associates, in its capacity as Financial Advisor, does not assume any responsibility

the federal income status of the Bond, or the possible impact of any present, pending or future actions

APPENDIX A 

 

THE DISTRICT 

Prospective  purchasers  of  the  Bonds  should  be  aware  that  the  following  discussion  of  the 
financial condition of the Arvin  Union School District (the “District”), its fund balances, budgets and 
obligations,  is  intended  as  general  information  only,  and  no  implication  is  made  that  the  payment  of 
principal of or interest on the Bonds is dependent in any way upon the District’s financial condition. The 
District neither receives nor accounts for ad valorem tax revenues collected by the County of Kern (the 
“County”) to pay debt service on the Bonds (or its other general obligation bonds) in the following tables 
or in its annual financial statements. Pursuant to Section 15251 of the California Education Code, all tax 
revenues collected for payment of debt service on the Bonds must be deposited into the debt service fund 
of the District. The Bonds are and will continue to be payable solely from ad valorem taxes levied and 
collected  by  the  County  within  the  boundaries  of  the  District.  See  the  body  of  this  Official  Statement 
under the caption “SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS.” 

This  Appendix  A  provides  information  concerning  the  operations  and  finances  of  the  District.  
The Bonds are general obligation bonds of the District, secured and payable from ad valorem property 
taxes assessed on taxable properties within the District.  The Bonds are not an obligation of the County, 
the State of California (the “State’) or any of its other political subdivisions or of the general fund of the 
District.  See “SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS” in the forepart of this 
Official Statement.

District Employees 

As  of  June  30,  2014,  the  District  employed  161  full-time  equivalent  certificated  academic 
professionals as well as 71 full-time equivalent classified employees.   In  addition, as of such date, the 
District employed 99 part-time employees.  The certificated employees of the District have assigned the 
California  Teachers  Association  (“CTA”)  as  their  exclusive  bargaining  agent.    The  certificated 
employees’  contract  with  CTA  expires  on  June  30,  2016.    The  classified  employees  have  assigned 
California School Employees Association  (“CSEA”)  as their exclusive bargaining  agent. The  classified 
employees contract with CSEA expires on June 30, 2015.    

Pension Plans 

The District participates in the State Teachers’ Retirement System (“STRS”).  This plan basically 
covers all full-time certificated employees.  The District’s employer contribution to STRS was $1,138,842 
for fiscal year 2013-14, and is projected to be $1,173,758 for fiscal year 2014-15.  

The  District  also  participates  in  the  State  Public  Employees’  Retirement  System  (“CalPERS”).  
This plan covers all classified personnel who are employed four or more hours per day.  The District’s 
employer contribution to CalPERS was $419,857 for fiscal year 2013-14, and estimates a contribution of 
$453,098  in  fiscal  year  2014-15.    The  District  is  currently  required  to  contribute  to  CalPERS  at  an 
actuarially determined rate, which is 11.847% of eligible salary expenditures for fiscal year 2015-16. 

Both CalPERS and STRS are operated on a statewide basis.  District contribution rates to PERS 
can vary annually depending on changes in actuarial assumption and other factors, such as liability.  Both 
PERS and STRS have substantial State unfunded actuarial liabilities. The amounts of the pension/award 
benefit  obligation  (CalPERS)  or  actuarially  accrued  liability  (STRS)  will  vary  from  time  to  time 
depending  upon  actuarial  assumptions,  rates  of  return  on  investments,  salary  scales,  and  levels  of 
contribution.  The District is unable to predict what the amount of liabilities will be in the future, or the 
amount of the contributions which the District may be required to make. 

 
 

A-3 

 

Unlike  typical  defined  benefit  programs,  however,  neither  the  STRS  employer  nor  the  State 
contribution rate varies annually to make up funding shortfalls or assess credits for actuarial surpluses.  
However, in recent years, the combined employer, employee and State contributions to STRS have not 
been sufficient to pay actuarially required amounts.  As a result, and due to significant investments losses, 
the unfunded actuarial liability of STRS has increased significantly.  The District is unable to predict what 
the  STRS program liabilities  will be  in  the future.  In order to address STRS funding inadequacies, the 
Governor  signed  AB  1469,  which  sets  forth  a  plan  of  shared  responsibility  among  the  State,  school 
districts and teachers to shore up STRS. The first year’s increased contributions from all three entities are 
approximately $275 million. The contributions would increase in subsequent years, reaching more than 
$5  billion  annually.  Governor  Brown  expects  that  this  will  eliminate  the  unfunded  liability  in 
approximately  30  years.  In  addition,  AB  1469  provides  the  State  Teachers  Retirement  Board  with 
authority to modify the percentages paid by employers and employees for fiscal year 2021-22 and each 
fiscal year thereafter with the goal of eliminating the CalSTRS unfunded liability by June 30, 2046. The 
State Teachers Retirement Board would also have authority to reduce employer and State contributions if 
they are no longer necessary. 

Pursuant to Assembly Bill 1469, contribution rates for the State’s K-14 districts will increase in 

accordance with the following schedule:

On  August  28,  2012,  Governor  Brown  signed  AB  340,  establishing  the  California  Public 
Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2012 (“PEPRA”), which governs pensions for public employers and 
public pension plans on and after January 1, 2013.  AB 340 (i) increases the retirement age for new State, 
school, and city and local agency employees, depending on job function, (ii)  caps pensionable salaries; 
(iii)  addresses  abuses  of  the  system  and  (iii)  requires  State,  school,  and  certain  city  and  local  agency 
employees  to  pay  at  least  half  of  the  cost  of  their  PERS  pension  benefits.    Although  the  District 
anticipates that PEPRA would not increase the District’s future pension obligations, the District is unable 
to determine the extent of any specific impact PEPRA would have on the District’s pension obligations at 
this time.  

The District is unable to predict what the amount of State pension liabilities will be in the future, 

or the amount of the contributions which the District may subsequently be required to make.  

Other Post-Employment Benefits 

Plan Description for Classified Employees. The District currently provides retiree and dependent 
medical coverage to eligible classified employees.  Persons employed before July 1, 1991, are eligible to 
receive  benefits  if  they  retire  between  the  age  of  50  and  65  with  five  years  or  more  service.    Persons 
employed after July 1, 1991, are eligible to receive benefits if they retire between the age of 55 and 65 

 
 

A-4 

 

with ten years or more service.  Persons employed after July 1, 1999, are eligible to receive benefits if 
they retire between the age of 55 and 65 with fifteen years or more service. 

Persons who meet the above eligibility requirements receive medical, dental and vision insurance 
until they reach the age of 65.  The eligible employees’ spouse and eligible dependents are also covered 
for the same period.  Persons employed prior to July 1, 1997, receive medical and prescription coverage 
until the age of 75, if the retiree is enrolled in Medicare.  Retirees in this group may receive dental and 
vision insurance if they pay the premiums.  

Persons retiring with less than 15 years of service are not eligible to receive medical benefits on a 
self-pay basis.  A person retiring with 15 years or more service is eligible to receive medical benefits up 
to $16,646 for fiscal year 2014-15 (The maximum for most employees was $16,646 for fiscal year 2014-
15). Currently, nine (9) employees meet those eligibility requirements.  

Retirees’ coverage ends the date the plan terminates or the date the retiree terminates coverage.  
In  the  instance  of  self-paid  and  partial  paid  retiree  benefits,  the  coverage  will  be  terminated  when 
payment is 90 days past due. Dependent coverage terminates the date he/she ceases to be a dependent. 

Plan Description for Certified Employees. The District currently provides retiree and dependent 
medical  coverage  to  eligible  certified  employees.   Persons  employed  prior  to  July  1,  1993,  who  have 
attained the age of 55 and have served as a regular certificated employee in the District for at least seven 
and one-half consecutive years may receive medical, dental, and vision insurance on the  same basis as 
regular  employees.    Persons  employed  after  July  1,  1993,  who  have  attained  the  age  of  55  and  have 
served as regular certificated employees in the District for at least fifteen consecutive years may receive 
medical, dental and vision insurance on the same basis as regular employees.  

Persons retiring with less than 15 years of service are not eligible to receive medical benefits on a 
self-pay basis.  A person retiring with 15 years or more service is eligible to receive medical benefits up 
to $16,248 for fiscal year 2014-15 (the maximum for most employees was $16,248 for fiscal year 2014-
15). Currently, 19 employees meet those eligibility requirements.  

For employees whose first paid date of contract services was on or after July 1, 1993, and who 
subsequently qualify for the foregoing age of 55 and 15 year retiree service benefit, the District will pay 
its  portion  of  the  insurance  premium  until  the  retiree  reaches  age  65.   After  age  65,  such  retirees  may 
continue coverage at their own expense. 

Retirees’ coverage ends the date the plan terminates or the date the retiree terminates coverage.  
In  the  instance  of  self-paid  and  partial  paid  retiree  benefits,  the  coverage  will  be  terminated  when 
payment is 90 days past due. Dependent coverage terminates the date he/she ceases to be a dependent. 

Funding  Policy.  The  District  currently  finances  benefits  on  a  pay-as-you-go  basis  for  health 
premiums. The District contributes 100% of the cost of the current year premiums for eligible retired plan 
members and their spouses as applicable.  For fiscal year 2012-13, the District contributed $946,774 for 
premiums.  For  fiscal  year  2013-14,  the  District  contributed  $979,748  for  premiums.    The  District  has 
budgeted a contribution of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2014-15 for health premiums.   

 
 

A-5 

 

The District  has transferred $3,791,473 (cash balance  as of June 30, 2014) to a special reserve 
fund to fund its outstanding liability with respect to its post-employment benefits. This fund has not been 
irrevocably pledged towards the District’s liability, however, and may be accessed by the District upon 
Board action. 

Insurance 

The  District  participates  in  a  joint  powers  agreement  (the  “JPA”)  for  insurance  programs  with 
Self Insured Schools of California (“SISC”).  The JPA provides property and liability insurance coverage, 
health and welfare benefits, and workers compensation insurance coverage.  The relationship between the 
District and the JPA is such that the JPA is not a component unit of the District for financial reporting 
purposes. 

State Funding of Education 

Public school district revenues  consist primarily of guaranteed State moneys, ad valorem taxes 
and  funds  received  from  the  State  and  federal  government  in  the  form  of  categorical  aid,  which  are 
amounts  restricted  to  specific  categories  of  use,  under  various  ongoing  programs.    All  State 
apportionment  (“State  Aid”)  is  subject  to  the  appropriation  of  funds  in  the  State’s  annual  budget.  
Decreases in State revenues may affect appropriations made by the State Legislature to the District. 

Historically,  approximately  85%  of  the  District’s  annual  General  Fund  revenues  (unrestricted) 
have consisted of payments from or under the control of the State. Payments made to K-12 public schools 
and public colleges  and universities are priority payments for State funds and are expected to be made 
prior  to  other  State  payment  obligations.    Although  the  State  Constitution  protects  the  priority  of 
payments to K-12 schools, college and universities, it does not protect the timing of such payments, and 
other  obligations  may  be  scheduled  and  have  been  scheduled  to  be paid  in  advance  of  those  dates  on 
which payments to school districts are scheduled to be made. 

On  June  27,  2013,  the  State  adopted  a  new  method  for  funding  school  districts  commonly 
referred  to  as  the  “Local  Control  Funding  Formula  (the  “LCFF”).   The  LCFF  will  be  implemented  in 
stages,  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2013-14  and  will  be  fully  implemented  in  fiscal  year  2020-21.  See  “– 
Local Control Funding Formula” below for more information. Prior to adoption of the LCFF, the State 
used a revenue limit funding system, described below under “– Revenue Limit Funding.”  

Revenue Limit Funding.    School  districts  in  the  State  have  historically  received  most  of  their 
revenues  under  a  formula  known  as  the  “revenue  limit.”  Generally,  revenue  limits  were  calculated  for 
each school district by multiplying the ADA for such district by a base revenue limit per unit of ADA.  
Revenue limit calculations were subject to adjustment to provide cost of living adjustments (“COLAs”) 
and to equalize revenues among school districts of the same type.  The revenue limit system of funding 
has  been  replaced  by  the  LCFF.  A  description  of  the  revenue  limit  system  is  included  herein  as  the 
District  has  historically  received  financial  assistance  from  the  State  pursuant  to  this  method  of 
appropriations.  

Each  school  district’s  revenue  limit,  which  was  funded  by  State  moneys  and  local  ad valorem 
property taxes from the general 1% ad valorem property tax levy, was allocated based on the ADA of 
each  school  district  for  either  the  current  or  preceding  school  year.  Generally,  State  Aid  to  a  school 
district  amounted  to  the  difference  between  the  school  district’s  revenue  limit  and  the  school  district’s 
local property tax allocation from the general 1% ad valorem property tax levy.   

 
 

A-6 

 

Local  Control  Funding  Formula.    Effective  in  fiscal  year  2013-14,  the  State  established  the 
LCFF,  a  new system for funding school districts, charter schools and county offices of education.  The 
LCFF  replaces  the  revenue  limit  funding  system,  as  well  as  many  categorical  programs.    The  LCFF 
distributes State resources to schools through a guaranteed base funding grant per unit of ADA (a “Base 
Grant”). The Base Grants per unit of ADA for each grade span are: (i) $6,845 for grades K-3; (ii) $6,947 
for grades 4-6; (iii) $7,154 for grades 7-8; and (iv) $8,289 for grades 9-12.  Implementation of the LCFF 
is  expected  to  take  several  years,  ending  in  fiscal  year  2020-21.    An  annual  transition  adjustment  is 
calculated for each school district, equal to such district’s proportionate share of appropriations included 
in  the  State  budget  to  close  the  gap  between  the  prior-year  funding  level  and  the  target  allocation 
following  full  implementation  of  the  LCFF.  Beginning  in  fiscal  year  2014-15,  the  Base  Grants  are 
adjusted  for  COLAs  by  applying  the  implicit  price  deflator  for  government  goods  and  services.  
Following full implementation of the LCFF, the provision of COLAs will be subject to appropriation for 
such adjustment in the annual State budget.     

The Base Grants for grades K-3 are subject to adjustments of 10.4% to cover the costs of class 
size reduction.  Following full implementation of the LCFF, and unless otherwise collectively bargained 
for, school districts serving students in  grades K-3 must maintain an average class enrollment of 24 or 
fewer students in grades K-3 at each school site in order to continue receiving the adjustment to the K-3 
Base  Grant.  The  Base  Grants  for  grades  9-12  are  subject  to  adjustments  of  2.6%  for  the  provision  of 
career technical education.   

School districts that serve students of limited English proficiency (“EL” students), students from 
low-income families that are eligible for free or reduced priced meals (“LI” students) and foster youth are 
eligible to receive additional funding grants.  Enrollment counts are unduplicated; if the school district has 
students with both limited English proficiency and eligibility for reduced price meals, for instance, such 
students will not be duplicated for purposes of determining the additional funding grants. Foster youths 
automatically  qualify  for  free  or  reduced  priced  meals.  A  supplemental  grant  add-on  (each,  a 
“Supplemental Grant”) is authorized for school districts that serve EL/LI students, equal to 20% of the 
applicable Base Grant multiplied by such districts’ percentage of unduplicated EL/LI student enrollment.  
School  districts  whose  EL/LI  populations  exceed  55%  of  their  total  enrollment  are  eligible  for  a 
concentration  grant  add-on (each, a  “Concentration Grant”) equal to 50% of the applicable Base Grant 
multiplied the percentage of such district’s unduplicated EL/LI student enrollment in excess of the 55% 
threshold.  The following table shows a breakdown of the District’s ADA by grade span, total enrollment, 
and the percentage of EL/LI student enrollment, for fiscal years 2012-13 and 2013-14.

The  LCFF  provides  for  a  permanent  economic  recovery  target  (“ERT”)  add-on  for  school 
districts that would have received greater funding levels under the revenue limit system. The ERT is equal 
to the difference between the revenue limit allocations such districts would have received under the prior 
system in Fiscal Year 2020-21, and the target LCFF allocations owed to such districts in the same year.  
The ERT add-on will be paid incrementally over the implementing period of the LCFF.  The District does 
not qualify for the ERT add-on. 

The  sum  of  a  school  district’s  adjusted  Base,  Supplemental  and  Concentration  Grants  will  be 
multiplied  by  such  district’s  P-2  ADA  for  the  current  or  prior  year,  whichever  is  greater  (with  certain 
adjustments applicable to small school districts).  This funding amount, together with any applicable ERT 
or categorical block grant add-ons, will yield a district’s total LCFF allocation.  Generally, the amount of 
annual State apportionments received by a school district will amount to the difference between such total 
LCFF allocation and such district’s share of applicable local property taxes.   

Beginning July 1, 2014, school districts are required to develop a three-year Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (each, an “LCAP”). County Superintendent of Schools and the State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction will review and provide support to the districts and county offices of education under 
their jurisdiction.  In addition, the Fiscal Year 2013-14 State Budget created the California Collaborative 
for  Education  Excellence  (the  “Collaborative”)  to  advise  and  assist  school  districts,  county  offices  of 
education, and charter schools in achieving the goals identified in their plans. The State Superintendent of 
Public  Instruction  may  direct  the  Collaborative  to  provide  additional  assistance  to  any  district,  county 
office, or charter school.  For those entities that continue to struggle in meeting their goals, and when the 
Collaborative  indicates  that  additional  intervention  is  needed,  the  State  Superintendent  of  Public 
Instruction has authority to make changes to the district or county office’s local plan. For charter schools, 
the charter authorizer will be required to consider revocation of a charter if the Collaborative finds that 
the inadequate performance is so persistent and acute as to warrant revocation.  The State will continue to 
measure student achievement through  statewide assessments, produce an  Academic Performance  Index 
for schools and subgroups of students, determine the contents of the school accountability report card, and 
establish policies to implement the federal accountability system. 

State Assistance 

Districts’ principal funding formulas and revenue sources are derived from the budget of the State 
of California.  The following discussion of the California State budget has been obtained from publicly 
available information which the District believes to be reliable; however neither District nor the Original 
Purchaser guarantee the accuracy or completeness of this information and have not independently verified 
such  information.    Additional  information  regarding  State  budgets  is  available  at  various  State-
maintained  websites,  including  www.dof.ca.gov.    These  websites  are  not  incorporated  herein  by 
reference  and  neither  the  District,  the  Financial  Advisor  nor  the  Original  Purchaser  makes  any 
representation as to the accuracy of the information provided therein. 

Fiscal Year 2014-15 State Budget  

On June 20, 2014, Governor Brown signed the fiscal year 2014-15 State Budget Act (the “2014-
15  State  Budget”).  The  2014-15  State  Budget  included  approximately  $109.3  billion  in  State  General 
Fund resources (including revenues, transfers and prior year balance) and approximately $108.0 billion in 
planned State General Fund expenditures. $1.6 billion in State General Fund revenues will be transferred 
to  a  budget  stabilization  fund.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  included  approximately  7.2  percent  State 
General Fund spending increase from the State’s fiscal year 2013-14 budget.  The 2014-15 State Budget 
included approximately $10 billion more in Proposition 98 funding than in fiscal year 2013-14.  

 
 

A-8 

 

The  2014-15  State  Budget  also  assumed  a  proposed  constitutional  amendment  to  strengthen 
California’s reserve fund. The constitutional amendment would, among other things, create a Proposition 
98 reserve, whereby spikes in funding would be saved for future years of decline, designed to minimize 
cuts  during  times  of  economic  downturn.  The  establishment  of  such  a  reserve  would  not  affect  the 
guaranteed level of funding for school districts under Proposition 98.  

The  2014-15  State  Budget  included  an  amendment  to  the  Education  Code  (“SB  858”)  which 
provides,  commencing  with  budgets  adopted  for  the  2015–16  fiscal  year  that  if  a  district’s  proposed 
budget  includes  a  local  reserve  above  the  minimum  recommended  level,  the  governing  board  of  the 
district must provide the information for review at the annual public hearing on its proposed budget. In 
addition, SB 858 included a provision, which limits the amount of reserves that may be maintained at the 
district level.  This proposed reserve fund “cap” became effective upon the passage of Proposition 2 on 
the  November  4,  2014  statewide  ballot.    Under  certain  circumstances,  this  provision  could  limit  the 
District’s ability to maintain reserves above  a certain level.  The District cannot predict  whether future 
conditions  precedent  to  such  cap  will  occur,  or  how  this  legislation  will  impact  its  reserves  and  future 
spending. 

The 2014-15 State Budget included the following significant adjustments affecting K-12 school 

districts:  

•  K-12 Deferrals – The 2014-15 State Budget repays nearly $4.7 billion Proposition 98 General 
Fund for K-12 expenses that had been deferred from one year to the next during the recent 
economic  downturn,  leaving  an  outstanding  balance  of  less  than  $900  million  in  K-12 
deferrals.    Further,  the  2014-15  State  Budget  includes  a  trigger  mechanism  that  will 
appropriate any additional funding resources attributable to fiscal years 2013-14 and 2014-15 
subsequent  to  the  enactment  of  the  2014-15  State  Budget  for  the  purpose  of  retiring  the 
remaining deferral balance.  

•  Local Control Funding Formula – An increase of $4.75 billion Proposition 98 General Fund 
to continue the State’s transition to the LCFF.  This increase will close the remaining funding 
implementation  gap  by  more  than  29  percent.    Additionally,  the  2014-15  State  Budget 
addresses an administrative problem related to the collection of income eligibility forms that 
are used to determine student eligibility for free or reduced-price meals. 

•  K-12 Mandates – An increase of $400.5 million in one-time Proposition 98 General Fund to 
reimburse K-12 local educational agencies for the costs of state-mandated programs.  These 
funds will make a significant down payment on outstanding mandate debt, while providing 
school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools with discretionary resources 
to support critical investments. 

•  Career  Technical  Education  Pathways  Program  –  An  increase  of  $250  million  in  one-time 
Proposition  98  General  Fund  to  support  a  second  cohort  of  competitive  grants  for 
participating K-12 local educational agencies.  Established in the 2013-14 State Budget Act, 
the  Career  Pathways  Trust  Program  provides  grant  awards  to  improve  career  technical 
programs and linkages between employers, schools, and community colleges.  

Governor’s Proposed 2015-16 Budget 

On  January  9,  2015,  Governor  Brown  released  his  proposed  fiscal  year  2015-16  budget  (the 
“2015-16 Proposed State Budget”).  The 2015-16 Proposed State Budget projects general fund revenues 
in the amount of $108 billion in fiscal year 2014-15 and $113.4 billion in fiscal year 2015-16.  Revenue 

 
 

A-9 

 

for fiscal year 2014-15 is forecast to be $2.5 billion greater than the amount forecast at the 2014 Budget 
Act. Revenue for fiscal year 2015-16 is forecast to be $1 billion greater than the amount forecast for the 
2014 Budget Act.  

Despite the recent budgetary improvements as compared to recent years, the 2015-16 Proposed 
State  Budget  acknowledges  that  the  State  continues  to  have  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  in  existing 
liabilities, such as unfunded retirement liabilities, and deferred maintenance of the State’s roads and other 
infrastructure  which  need  to  be  addressed.  Furthermore,  the  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget  observes 
several  risks  that  the  State  should  plan  for,  including  the  inevitable  occurrence  of  another  recession, 
ongoing  fiscal  challenges  of  the  federal  government  and  the  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget’s  heavy 
dependency on the performance of the stock market in fiscal year 2015-16. 

Under the 2015-16 Proposed State Budget, general fund expenditures for fiscal year 2015-16 are 
$113.3 billion (an increase of $1.5 billion from fiscal year 2014-15 general fund expenditures), of which 
$47.1  billion  (41.6%)  is  allocated  to  K-12  education.  The  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget  provides 
Proposition 98 funding of $65.7 billion for fiscal year 2015-16, as well as an additional $2.3 billion and 
$400 million for fiscal years 2014-15 and 2013-14, respectively.  

Total per-pupil expenditures from all sources are projected to be $13,223 in fiscal year 2014-15 
and  $13,462  in  fiscal  year  2015-16,  including  funds  provided  for  prior  year  “settle-up”  obligations.  
Ongoing  K-12  Proposition  98 per-pupil  expenditures  are $9,667  in  fiscal  year  2015-16, an  increase  of 
$306  per-pupil  over  the  level  provided  in  2014-15.  The  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget  notes  that 
attendance  in  public  schools  grew  in  fiscal  year  2010-11  and  fiscal  year  2011-12,  declined  slightly  in 
fiscal year 2012-13, increased again in fiscal year 2013-14 and is projected to grow further in fiscal year 
2014-15  and  decline  slightly  in  fiscal  year  2015-16.    For  fiscal  year  2014-15,  K-12  Average  Daily 
Attendance (“ADA”) is estimated to be 6,000,733, an increase of 8,166 from fiscal year 2013-14.  K-12 
ADA is estimated to drop by 585 in fiscal year 2015-16 to 6,000,148. 

The  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget  also  provides  a  third-year  investment  of  $4  billion  in  the 
Local Control Funding Formula, which is expected to eliminate more than 32% of the remaining funding 
gap between actual funding and the target level of funding. This investment builds upon the almost $6.8 
billion provided over the last two years.  

The  2014-15  Proposed  State  Budget  included  the  following  significant  adjustments  affecting 

California K-12 school districts:  

•  K-12  Deferrals—An  increase  of  almost  $900  million  in  one-time  Proposition  98  general 
funds  in  fiscal  year  2015-16  to  eliminate  all  remaining  outstanding  deferral  debt  for K-12.  
Inter-year deferrals for K-12 had reached a high of $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011-12. 

•  Emergency  Repair  Program—An  increase  of  $273.4  million  in  one-time  Proposition  98 
general  fund  resources  for  the  Emergency  Repair  Program.    This  funding  will  retire  the 
state’s  facilities  funding  obligation  under  the  terms  of  an  existing  lawsuit  settlement 
agreement. 

•  School  District  Local  Control  Funding  Formula—Additional  growth  of  approximately  $4 
billion in Proposition 98 general funds for school districts and charter schools in fiscal year 
2015-16, an increase of 8.7 percent. 

 
 

A-10 

 

•  County  Offices  of  Education  Local  Control  Funding  Formula—An  increase  of  $109,000 
Proposition 98 general funds to support a cost-of-living adjustment for those county offices of 
education at their target funding level under the formula. 

•  Charter  Schools—An  increase  of  $59.5  million  Proposition  98  general  funds  to  support 

projected charter school ADA growth. 

•  Special  Education—An  increase  of  $15.3  million  Proposition  98  general  funds  to  reflect  a 

projected increase in Special Education ADA. 

•  Cost-of-Living Adjustment Increases—An increase of $71.1 million to support a 1.58-percent 
cost-of-living adjustment for categorical programs that remain outside of the Local Control 
Funding  Formula,  including  Special  Education,  Child  Nutrition,  Foster  Youth,  Preschool, 
American  Indian  Education  Centers,  and  the  American  Indian  Early  Childhood  Education 
Program.    Cost-of-living  adjustments  for  school  districts  and  charters  schools  are  provided 
within the increases for school district Local Control Funding Formula implementation noted 
above. 

•  Local Property Tax Adjustments—A decrease of $11.4 million Proposition 98 general funds 
for  the  school  district  and  county  office  of  education  in  fiscal  year  2014-15  as  a  result  of 
higher offsetting property tax revenues.  A decrease of $1.7 billion in Proposition 98 general 
funds for school districts and county offices of education in fiscal year 2015-16 as a result of 
increased offsetting local property tax revenues. 

•  Average Daily Attendance—An increase of $197.6 million in fiscal year 2014-15 for school 
districts and county offices of education as a result of an increase in projected ADA from the 
2014 Budget Act, and a decrease of $6.9 million in fiscal year 2015-16 for school districts 
and  county  offices  of  education  as  a  result  of  projected  decline  in  ADA  for  fiscal  year 
2015-16. 

•  Full-Day State Preschool Slots—An increase of $14.8 million Proposition 98 general funds 
and  $18.8  million  non-Proposition  98  general  funds  to  support  4,000  State  Preschool  slots 
with  full-day  wraparound  care.  These  slots  were  established  in  the  2014  Budget  Act  as  of 
June 15, 2015 (for 15 days in fiscal year 2014-15) and these increases reflect the difference in 
full-year cost for these slots in fiscal year 2015-16. 

May Revision.  On May 14, 2015, the Governor released his May revision (the “May Revision”) 
to the 2015-16 Proposed State Budget.  The following information is extracted from the Department of 
Finance  (“DOF”)  summary  of  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget,  included  on  the  DOF  website  at 
www.dof.ca.gov.  The information presented on such website is not incorporated herein by this reference. 

The  May  Revision  assumes  continued  improvements  in  the  State  and  national  economies, 
generating higher capital gains tax collections for the State.  The May Revision allocates the bulk of such 
higher  collections  towards  education  funding,  additional  deposits  to  the  Budget  Stabilization  Account 
(“BSA”) and additional payments towards outstanding State special fund loans.   

After  accounting  for  transfers  to  the  BSA,  the  May  Revision  projects  year-end  general  fund 
revenues for fiscal year 2014-15 to be $111.3 billion, approximately $3.3 billion higher than projected in 
the  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget.   State  general  fund  expenditures  are  also  expected  to  increase  by 
approximately  $2.8  billion,  for  a  year-end  total  of  $114.5  billion.   The  May  Revision  projects  that  the 
State will end fiscal year 2014-15 with a surplus of $3 billion, composed of a $1.4 billion balance in the 

 
 

A-11 

 

general fund reserve and a $1.6 billion balance in the BSA.  For fiscal year 2015-16, the May Revision 
projects  State  general fund revenues of $115 billion, approximately $1.7 billion higher  than previously 
projected.    The  May  Revision  would  authorize  State  general  fund  expenditures  of  $115.3  billion,  an 
increase of $2 billion from the level in the 2015-16 Proposed State Budget.  The State is projected to end 
fiscal year 2015-16 with a $4.6 billion general fund surplus, composed of a $1.1 billion balance in the 
general fund reserve and $3.5 billion in the BSA. 

The May Revision includes revised estimates of the minimum funding guarantees for schools for 
fiscal years 2013-14 and 2014-15.  The fiscal year 2013-14 minimum funding guarantee is set at $58.9 
billion, an increase of $241 million above the revised level included the 2015-16 Proposed State Budget.  
The fiscal year 2014-15 minimum funding  guarantee  is  set  at $66.3 billion, an increase  of $3.1 billion 
from the revised level included in the 2015-16 Proposed State Budget.   

For fiscal year 2015-16, the May Revision revises the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee 
to  $68.4  billion,  an  increase  of  approximately  $2.7  billion  from  the  level  included  in  the  2015-16 
Proposed State Budget.  Major adjustments made to education funding in the May Revision include the 
following: 

•  LCFF – An additional $2.1 billion in funding to continue implementation of the LCFF, for a 
total of $6.1 billion.  The May Revision estimates that this would close approximately 53% of 
the remaining funding gap. 

•  Career  Technical  Education  –  An  additional  $150  million  in  fiscal  year  2015-16  for  the 
competitive grant initiative that supports K-12 CTE programs that lead to industry-recognized 
credentials or postsecondary training.  The May Revision also anticipates additional funding 
of $50 million for CTE in fiscal year 2016-17 and reduces the amount estimated for fiscal 
year 2017-18 by $25 million, when compared to levels in the 2015-16 Proposed State Budget.   

•  Quality Education Investment Act – An increase of $4.6 million in one-time Proposition 98 
funding  to  provide  half  of  the  final  apportionment  of  QEIA  funding  for  selected  school 
districts in 2015-16 that do not qualify for concentration grant funding under the LCFF.  This 
funding  is  intended  to  ease  the  transition  for  those  districts  with  concentrations  of  EL/LI 
students that will no longer receive funds under the QEIA. 

•  Local Property  Tax  Adjustments – Total Proposition 98 funding  levels for school districts, 
special education local plan areas and county offices of education in fiscal years 2014-15 and 
2015-16 would be reduced by $123.3 million and $224 million, respectively, to reflect higher 
offsetting property tax collections. 

•  Proposition 39 – A decrease in the amount of funds available under Proposition 39 to K-12 
school  districts  in  2015-16  by  $6.7  million  to  reflect  reduced  State  corporate  tax  revenue 
estimates. 

•  Categorical Programs – A reduction of $18.4 million in Proposition 98 funding for selected 
categorical  programs,  based  on  updated  ADA  growth  estimates.    The  May  Revision  also 
decreases Proposition 98 funding by $22.1 million for select categorical programs, to reflect a 
change in the COLA for such programs from 1.58% (as provided in the Proposed Budget) to 
1.02%. 

 
 

A-12 

 

•  Special  Education  –  The  May  Revision  proposes  $60.1  million  of  Proposition  98  funding 
(composed  of  $50.1  million  of  ongoing  funding  and  $10  million  of  one-time  funds)  to 
implement  selected  programmatic  changes  in  special  education  services.    The  changes  are 
intended  to  implement  recommendations  issued  by  a  State  taskforce  on  special  education 
formed in 2013, as well as to make targeted investments designed to improve service delivery 
and outcomes for disabled students.

State law requires school districts to maintain a balanced budget in each fiscal year.  The State 

Department of Education imposes a uniform budgeting and accounting format for school districts. 

Under current law, a school district governing board must file with the county superintendent of 
schools a tentative budget by July 1 in each fiscal year and an adopted budget by September 8 of each 
fiscal year.  After approval of the adopted budget, the school district’s administration may submit budget 
revisions for governing board approval. 

 
 

A-14 

 

School  districts  in  California  must  also  conduct  a  review  of  their  budgets  according  to  certain 
standards and criteria established by the State Department of Education.  A written explanation must be 
provided  for  any  element  in  the  budget  that  does  not  meet  the  established  standards  and  criteria.    The 
district  superintendent  or  designee  must  certify  that  such  a  review  has  been  conducted  and  the 
certification,  together  with  the  budget  review  checklist  and  a  written  narrative,  must  accompany  the 
budget when it is submitted to the governing board for approval.  The balanced budget requirement makes 
appropriations reductions necessary to offset any revenue shortfalls. 

Furthermore,  county  superintendent  of  schools  offices  are  required  to  review  district  budgets, 
complete the budget review checklist and conduct an analysis of any budget item that does not meet the 
established  standards. 
  A  copy  of  the  completed  checklist,  together  with  any  comments  or 
recommendations,  must  be  provided  to  the  district  and  its  governing  board  by  November  1.    By 
November 30, every district must have an adopted and approved budget, or the county superintendent of 
schools will impose one. 

Presented on the following page are the District’s Adopted Budgets for fiscal years 2013-14 and 

2014-15 along with the 2014-15 First Interim numbers.  The District adopted its budget for fiscal year 
2014-15 on June 16, 2014.

FORM OF BOND COUNSEL OPINION FOR SERIES A BONDS 

APPENDIX B-1 

 

[Closing Date] 

Board of Trustees 
Arvin Union School District 
737 Bear Mountain Boulevard 
Arvin, California  93203 

Re: 

Arvin Union School District (Kern County, California)  
$3,115,000 General Obligation Bonds, Election of 2014, Series 2015A  

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

We have acted as Bond Counsel to the Arvin School District, County of Kern, State of California 
(the “District”), in connection with the issuance by the District of $3,115,000 aggregate principal amount 
of its General Obligation Bonds, Election of 2014, Series 2015A (the “Bonds”).  The Bonds are issued 
pursuant to Section 53506 et seq. of the Government Code of the State of California, as amended, and the 
resolution  adopted  by  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  District  on April  21,  2015  (the  “Resolution”).    All 
terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Resolution. 

As Bond Counsel, we have examined copies, certified to us as being true and complete copies, of 
the proceedings of the District for the authorization and issuance of the Bonds.  In connection thereto, we 
have also examined such certificates of public officials and officers of the District as we have considered 
necessary  for  the  purposes  of  this  opinion.    We  have,  with  your  approval,  assumed  that  all  items 
submitted  to  us  as  originals  are  authentic  and  that  all  items  submitted  to  us  as  copies  conform  to  the 
originals. 

On the basis of such examination, our  reliance  upon the assumptions contained herein  and our 
consideration  of  those  questions  of  law  we  considered  relevant,  and  subject  to  the  limitations  and 
qualifications in this opinion, we are of the opinion that: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The Bonds have been duly authorized and issued and constitute legally valid and binding 
obligations of the District, enforceable in accordance with their terms and the terms of the 
Resolution. 

The  Bonds  are  payable  solely  from  and  are  secured  by  a  pledge  of  ad  valorem  taxes 
which may be levied without limitation as to rate or amount upon all taxable real property 
in the District, and which, under the laws now in force with respect to the Bonds, may be 
levied  within  the  limit  prescribed  by  law  upon  all  taxable  personal  property  in  the 
District, as set forth in the Resolution. 

The Resolution has been duly authorized by the District and constitutes the legally valid 
and  binding  obligation  of  the  District,  enforceable  in  accordance  with  its  terms.    The 
Bonds, assuming due authentication by the Paying Agent, are entitled to the benefits of 
the Resolution. 

 
 

B-1 - 1 

 

4. 

5.  

6. 

The  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  “Code”)  sets  forth  certain 
requirements which must be met subsequent to the issuance and delivery of the Bonds for 
interest  thereon  to  be  and  remain  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax 
purposes.  Noncompliance with such requirements could cause the interest on the Bonds 
to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of 
issue of the Bonds.  Pursuant to the Resolution and the Tax and Nonarbitrage Certificate 
executed  by  the  District  in  connection  with  the  issuance  of  the  Bonds  (the  “Tax 
Certificate”), the District has covenanted to comply with the applicable requirements of 
the  Code  in  order  to  maintain  the  exclusion  of  the  interest  on  the  Bonds  from  gross 
income for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 103 of the Code.  In addition, 
the District has made certain representations and certifications in the Resolution and the 
Tax Certificate.  We have not independently verified the accuracy of those certifications 
and representations.   

Under existing law, assuming compliance with the tax covenants described herein and the 
accuracy of the aforementioned representations and certifications, interest on the Bonds is 
excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  under  Section  103 of  the 
Code.  We are also of the opinion that such interest is not treated as a preference item in 
calculating  the  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  under  the  Code  with  respect  to 
individuals and corporations.  Interest on the Bonds is, however, included in the adjusted 
current  earnings  of  certain  corporations  for  purposes  of  computing  the  alternative 
minimum tax imposed on such corporations. 

Interest  on  the  Bonds  is  exempt  from  personal  income  taxes  of  the  State  of  California 
under present state law. 

Bond Counsel is further of the opinion that the difference between the principal amount 
of the Bonds maturing on November 1, 2029 through November 1, 2035, inclusive, and 
on November 1, 2040 and November 1, 2044 (collectively, the “Discount Bonds”) and 
the initial offering price to the public (excluding bond houses, brokers, or similar persons 
or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters or wholesalers) at which price a 
substantial  amount  of  such  Discount  Bonds  of  the  same  maturity  was  sold  constitutes 
original  issue  discount  which  is  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax 
purposes  to  the  same  extent  as  interest  on  the  Bonds.    Further,  such  original  issue 
discount  accrues  actuarially  on  a  constant  interest  rate  basis  over  the  term  of  each 
Discount Bond and the basis of each Discount Bond acquired at such initial offering price 
by an initial purchaser thereof will be increased by the amount of such accrued original 
issue discount.  The accrual of original issue discount may be taken into account as an 
increase in the amount of tax-exempt income for purposes of determining various other 
tax  consequences  of  owning  the  Discount  Bonds,  even  though  there  will  not  be  a 
corresponding cash payment. 

The opinions set forth in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 above (i) assume that the Paying Agent has duly 
authenticated  the  Bonds  and  (ii)  are  subject  to  (a)  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization, 
moratorium  or  similar  laws  relating  to  or  affecting  creditors’  rights  generally  (including,  without 
limitation, fraudulent conveyance laws), (b) the effect of general principles of equity, including, without 
limitation,  concepts  of  materiality,  reasonableness,  good  faith  and  fair  dealing  and  the  possible 
unavailability  of  specific  performance  or  injunctive  relief,  regardless  of  whether  considered  in  a 
proceeding in equity or at law, and (c) the limitations on legal remedies against government entities in the 
State of California. 

 
 

B-1 - 2 

 

In  rendering  the  opinions  set  forth  in  paragraphs  4  and  6  above,  we  are  relying  upon 
representations and covenants of the District in the Tax Certificate concerning the investment and use of 
Bond  proceeds,  the  rebate  to  the  federal  government  of  certain  earnings  thereon,  and  the  use  of  the 
property and facilities financed with the proceeds of the Bonds.  In addition, we have assumed that all 
such  representations are  true  and  correct  and that  the District  will comply  with  such  covenants.     We 
express no opinion with respect to the exclusion of the interest on the Bonds from gross income under 
Section 103(a) of the Code in the event that any of such representations are untrue or the District fails to 
comply with such covenants, unless such failure to comply is based on our advice or opinion. 

Except as stated in paragraphs 4 through 6, we express no opinion as to any other federal, state or 
local tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of the Bonds.  Furthermore, we express no opinion 
as to any federal, state or local tax law consequences with respect to the Bonds, or the interest thereon, if 
any action is taken with respect to the Bonds or the proceeds thereof upon the advice or approval of other 
counsel. 

No  opinion  is  expressed  herein  on  the  accuracy,  completeness  or  sufficiency  of  the  Official 
Statement  or  other  offering  material  relating  to  the  Bonds.    This  opinion  is  expressly  limited  to  the 
matters set forth above and we render no opinion, whether by implication or otherwise, as to any other 
matters. 

Our opinions are limited to matters of California law and applicable federal law, and we assume 
no responsibility as to the applicability of laws of other jurisdictions.  We call attention to the fact that the 
opinions  expressed  herein  and  the  exclusion  of  interest  on  the  Bonds  from  gross  income  for  federal 
income tax purposes may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring or failing to occur 
after  the  date  hereof.    We  have  not  undertaken  to  determine,  or  inform  any  person,  whether  any  such 
actions are taken, omitted, occur or fail to occur. 

Respectfully submitted,

FORM OF BOND COUNSEL OPINION FOR REFUNDING BONDS 

APPENDIX B-2 

 

[Closing Date] 

 

Board of Trustees 
Arvin Union School District 
737 Bear Mountain Boulevard 
Arvin, California  93203 

Re: 

Arvin Union School District (Kern County, California)  
$3,860,000 General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2015A  

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

We have acted as Bond Counsel to the Arvin Union School District, County of Kern, State of 
California  (the  “District”),  in  connection  with  the  issuance  by  the  District  of  $3,860,000  aggregate 
principal amount of its General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2015A (the “Bonds”).  The Bonds 
are issued pursuant to the provisions of Articles 9 and 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of 
the Government Code of the State of California, as amended, and the resolution adopted by the Board of 
Education of the District on April 21, 2015 (the “Resolution”).  All terms used herein and not otherwise 
defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Resolution. 

As Bond Counsel, we have examined copies, certified to us as being true and complete copies, of 
the proceedings of the District for the authorization and issuance of the Bonds.  In connection thereto, we 
have also examined such certificates of public officials and officers of the District as we have considered 
necessary for the purposes of this opinion. We have, with your approval, assumed that all items submitted 
to us as originals are authentic and that all items submitted to us as copies conform to the originals. 

On the basis of such examination, our  reliance  upon the assumptions contained herein  and our 
consideration  of  those  questions  of  law  we  considered  relevant,  and  subject  to  the  limitations  and 
qualifications in this opinion, we are of the opinion that: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The Bonds have been duly authorized and issued and constitute legally valid and binding 
obligations of the District, enforceable in accordance with their terms and the terms of the 
Resolution. 

The  Bonds  are  payable  solely  from  and  are  secured  by  a  pledge  of  ad  valorem  taxes 
which may be levied without limitation as to rate or amount upon all taxable real property 
in the District, and which, under the laws now in force with respect to the Bonds, may be 
levied  within  the  limit  prescribed  by  law  upon  all  taxable  personal  property  in  the 
District, and from other available funds as set forth in the Resolution. 

The Resolution has been duly authorized by the District and constitutes the legally valid 
and  binding  obligation  of  the  District,  enforceable  in  accordance  with  its  terms.    The 
Bonds, assuming due authentication by the Paying Agent, are entitled to the benefits of 
the Resolution. 

 
 

B-2 -1 

 

4. 

The  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  “Code”)  sets  forth  certain 
requirements which must be met subsequent to the issuance and delivery of the Bonds for 
interest  thereon  to  be  and  remain  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax 
purposes.  Noncompliance with such requirements could cause the interest on the Bonds 
to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of 
issue of the Bonds.  Pursuant to the Resolution and the Tax and Nonarbitrage Certificate 
executed  by  the  District  in  connection  with  the  issuance  of  the  Bonds  (the  “Tax 
Certificate”), the District has covenanted to comply with the applicable requirements of 
the  Code  in  order  to  maintain  the  exclusion  of  the  interest  on  the  Bonds  from  gross 
income for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 103 of the Code.  In addition, 
the District has made certain representations and certifications in the Resolution and the 
Tax Certificate.  We have not independently verified the accuracy of those certifications 
and representations.   

Under existing law, assuming compliance with the tax covenants described herein and the 
accuracy of the aforementioned representations and certifications, interest on the Bonds is 
excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  under  Section  103 of  the 
Code.  We are also of the opinion that such interest is not treated as a preference item in 
calculating  the  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  under  the  Code  with  respect  to 
individuals and corporations.  Interest on the Bonds is, however, included in the adjusted 
current  earnings  of  certain  corporations  for  purposes  of  computing  the  alternative 
minimum tax imposed on such corporations. 

5. 

Interest  on  the  Bonds  is  exempt  from  personal  income  taxes  of  the  State  of  California 
under present state law. 

The opinions set forth in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 above (i) assume that the Paying Agent has duly 
authenticated  the  Bonds  and  (ii)  are  subject  to  (a)  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization, 
moratorium  or  similar  laws  relating  to  or  affecting  creditors’  rights  generally  (including,  without 
limitation, fraudulent conveyance laws), (b) the effect of general principles of equity, including, without 
limitation,  concepts  of  materiality,  reasonableness,  good  faith  and  fair  dealing  and  the  possible 
unavailability  of  specific  performance  or  injunctive  relief,  regardless  of  whether  considered  in  a 
proceeding in equity or at law, and (c) the limitations on legal remedies against government entities in the 
State of California. 

In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraph 4 above, we are relying upon representations and 
covenants of the District in the Tax Certificate concerning the investment and use of Bond proceeds, the 
rebate  to  the  federal  government  of  certain  earnings  thereon,  and  the  use  of  the  property  and  facilities 
refinanced with the proceeds of the Bonds.  In addition, we have assumed that all such representations are 
true and correct  and that  the District  will comply with  such  covenants.     We  express  no opinion with 
respect to the exclusion of the interest on the Bonds from gross income under Section 103(a) of the Code 
in the event that any of such representations are untrue or the District fails to comply with such covenants, 
unless such failure to comply is based on our advice or opinion. 

Except as stated in paragraph 4 and 5, we express no opinion as to any other federal, state or local 
tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of the Bonds.  Furthermore, we express no opinion as to 
any federal, state or local tax law consequences with respect to the Bonds, or the interest thereon, if any 
action is  taken  with respect to the Bonds or  the proceeds thereof upon the advice or  approval of other 
counsel. 

 
 

B-2 - 2 

 

No  opinion  is  expressed  herein  on  the  accuracy,  completeness  or  sufficiency  of  the  Official 
Statement  or  other  offering  material  relating  to  the  Bonds.    This  opinion  is  expressly  limited  to  the 
matters set forth above and we render no opinion, whether by implication or otherwise, as to any other 
matters. 

Our opinions are limited to matters of California law and applicable federal law, and we assume 
no responsibility as to the applicability of laws of other jurisdictions.  We call attention to the fact that the 
opinions  expressed  herein  and  the  exclusion  of  interest  on  the  Bonds  from  gross  income  for  federal 
income tax purposes may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring or failing to occur 
after  the  date  hereof.    We  have  not  undertaken  to  determine,  or  inform  any  person,  whether  any  such 
actions are taken, omitted, occur or fail to occur. 

 

Respectfully submitted,

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT 

Board of Trustees 
Arvin Union School District 
Arvin, California: 

Report on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, 
each major fund,  and the aggregate remaining fund information of Arvin Union School District 
as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014, and the related notes to the financial  statements, 
which collectively comprise the District's basic financial  statements as listed in the table of 
contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation ofthese financial 
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America; this includes the design,  implementation, and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are 
free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditors' Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the 
United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in 
Government Auditing Standards,  issued by the Comptroller General  of the United States. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial  statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditors' 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, the auditors

(559) 438-8740  • FAX 438-8746 

-1-

consider internal control relevant to the District's preparation and fair presentation of the 
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the entity's internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also 
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinions. 

Opinions 

In our opinion, the financial  statements referred to above present fairly,  in all material 
respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, each major 
fund,  and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Arvin Union School District, 
as of June 30, 2014, and the respective changes in financial position thereof for the year 
then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. 

Other Matters 

Required Supplementary Information 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the 
Management's Discussion and Analysis and budgetary comparison information on Pages 
5- 12, and Page 55 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements.  Such 
information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of 
financial reporting for placing the basic financial  statements in an appropriate 
operational, economic, or historical context.  We have applied certain limited procedures 
to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards 
generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of 
management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the 
information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic 
financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic 
financial statements.  We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the 
information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to 
express an opinion or provide any assurance. 

Other Information 

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements 
that collectively comprise the Arvin Union School District's basic financial statements. 
The introductory section, the combining General Fund financial statements and the 

-2-

combining and individual nonmajor fund financial statements, and other supplementary 
information listed in the table of contents are presented for purposes of additional 
analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. 

The combining General Fund financial statements and the combining and individual 
nonmajor fund financial statements are the responsibility of management and were 
derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to 
prepare the basic financial statements.  The accompanying schedule of expenditures of 
federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by U.S. Office 
of Management and Budget Circular A-133, Audits of States,  Local Governments,  and 
Non-Profit Organizations, and is also not a required part of the basic financial 
statements of the Arvin Union School District.  The combining General Fund financial 
statements and the combining and individual nonmajor fund financial statements, the 
schedule of average daily attendance, the schedule of instructional time, and the 
schedule of expenditures of federal awards have been subjected to the auditing 
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional 
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the 
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or 
to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. 
In our opinion, the combining General Fund financial statements and the combining and 
individual nonmajor fund financial statements, the schedule of average daily attendance, 
the schedule of instructional time, and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are 
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a 
whole. 

The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing 
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, accordingly, we do 
not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated 

December 4, 2014 on our consideration of the Arvin Union School District's internal control 
over financial reporting and on compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts, and grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that report is to describe the 
scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.  That report is 
an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in 
considering Arvin Union School District's internal control over financial reporting and 
compliance. 

Emphasis of Matter Regarding Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 1 G 14 to the financial statements, in 2014 the District adopted new 
accounting guidance as follows:  GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as 

-3-

Assets and Liabilities; GASB Statement No. 66,  Technical Corrections-2012; and GASB 
67, Financial Reporting for Pension Plans- An Amendment ofGASB Statement No.  25. 
Our opinion is not modified with respect to these matters.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,2014 

This section of Arvin Union School  District's annual  financial  report presents 
our discussion and  analysis  of the District's financial  performance during  the 
fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2014. 

The  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  (MD&A)  is  an  element  of 
Required  Supplementary 
the  Governmental 
Accounting  Standards  Board  (GASB)  Statement  No.  34  - Basic  Financial 
Statements  - and  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  -
for  State  and 
Local Governments issued in June 1999. 

Information  specified 

in 

Financial Highlights: 

+  The  District  is  able  to  meet  all  of the  current  needs  and  maintain  an 

adequate reserve. 

+  Overall  revenues  for  all  governmental  funds  were  $33,933,076  and 
expenditures  were  $34,816,736,  which  caused  a  decrease  in  fund 
balance of $883,660. 

Overview of the Financial Statements: 

This  annual  repmi  consists  of three  parts:  Management's  Discussion  and 
Analysis (this section), the  Basic Financial Statements and the Supplementary 
Information. 

The  Basic  Financial  Statements  include  two  kinds  of statements  that  present 
different views of the District: 

Di stinguished Achieve ment Award 
2011  AIR  Health Awards 
California  Depo rtment of  Public  Hecdth 

-5-

+  The first two  statements are District-wide financial  statements that provide both short(cid:173)

term and long-term information about the District's overall financial status. 

+  The remaining statements are fund financial statements that focus on individual parts of 
the  District,  reporting  the  District's  operation  in  more  detail  than  the  District-wide 
statements. 

+  The  governmental  fund  statements  tell  how  basic  services  like  regular  and  special 
education were financed in the short-term, as well as what remains for future spending. 

+  The fiduciary fund statements are for the student body funds. 

The  financial  statements  also  include  notes  that explain  some  of the  information  in the  statements 
and  provide more detailed  data.  Figure A-1  shows  how the various  parts  of this  annual  report  are 
arranged and related to one another.

Detail 

District-Wide Statements: 

The  District-wide  financial  statements  report  information  about  the  District  as  a  whole  using 
accounting methods similar to those used by private sector companies.  The statement of net position 
includes  all  of the  District's assets  and  liabilities.  All  of the current year's revenues  and  expenses 
are accounted for in the statement of activities, regardless of when cash is received or paid. 

-6-

The  two  District-wide  statements  report  the  District's  net  position.  Net  position - the  difference 
between the District's assets and liabilities- is one way to measure the  District's financial health or 
position.  Over  time,  increases  or  decreases  in  the  District's  net  position  will  be  an  indicator  of 
whether its financial position is improving or deteriorating, respectively. 

To  assess the overall health of the District you need to consider additional non-financial factors such 
as the condition of school buildings and other facilities. 

District-wide  financial  statements  include  the  governmental  activities,  which  include  the  basic 
services  such  as  regular  and  special  education,  transportation,  and  administration.  Property  taxes 
and state formula aid finance most of these activities. 

Fund Financial Statements: 

The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the District's most significant 
funds - not the District as a whole.  Funds are accounting devices the District uses to  keep track of 
specific sources of funding and spending on particular programs. 

+  Some funds are required by State law and by bond covenants. 

+  The District establishes other funds to control and manage money for particular purposes.

to  try  and  maintain  reserves  and  cut  expenditures,  while  maintaining  an  outstanding  educational 
environment.

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of activities 
are different from  amounts reported in governmental  funds  because: 

Capital Outlay:  In governmental funds,  the costs of capital assets are reported as 
expenditures in the period when the assets are acquired.  In the statement of activities, 
costs of capital assets are allocated over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense. 
The difference between capital outlay expenditures and depreciation expense for the period was: 

Expenditures for capital outlay

Debt Service:  In governmental funds,  repayments of long-term debt are reported as expenditures. 
In the government-wide statements, repayments oflong-term debt are reported as reductions 
of liabilities.  Expenditures for repayment of the principal portion oflong-term debt were: 

Debt Issue Costs for Prepaid Debt Insurance:  In governmental funds,  debt issue costs  are 
recognized as expenditures in the period they are incurred.  In the government-wide 
statements, debt issue costs tor prepaid debt insurance are amortized over the life of the 
debt.  The difference between debt issue costs recognized in the current period and 
debt issue costs amortized for the period was: 

Prepaid debt insurance incurred during the period

Net 

Unmatured Interest on Long-Tenn Debt:  In governmental funds,  interest on long-tenn debt 
is recognized in the period that it becomes due.  In the government-wide statement of 
activities,  it is recognized in the period that it is  incurred.  Unmatured interest owing at the end of 
the period, less matured interest paid during the period but owing from the prior period, was: 

Compensated Absences:  In governmental funds,  compensated absences are measured 
by the amounts paid during the period.  In the statement of activities, compensated 
absences are measured by the amounts earned.  The difference between compensated 
absences paid and compensated absences earned was: 

Other Expenditures Relating to Prior Periods:  Certain expenditures recognized in govemmental 
funds  relate to prior periods.  Typical examples,  in addition to compensated absences  and 
interest on long-term debt, are payments on structured legal settlements or retirement incentives 
paid over time.  These expenditures are recognized in the government-wide statement of activities 
in the period in which the obligations are first incurred, so they must not be recognized again 
in the cmTent period.  Expenditures relating to prior periods (described below) were: 

Early retirement incentives 

Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB):  In governmental 
funds,  OPEB costs are recognized when employer contributions are made. 
In the statement of activities, OPEB costs are recognized on the accrual basis.  This 
year, the difference between OPEB costs and actual employer contributions was: 

Other Liabilities Not Normally Liquidated With Current Financial Resources: 
In the government-wide statements, expenses must be accrued in connection 
with any liabilities incurred during the period that are not expected to be 
liquidated with current financial resources, in addition to compensated absences 
and long-term debt.  Examples include special termination benefits such as 
retirement incentives financed over time, and structured legal settlements.

1. 

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Arvin Union School District (the "District") was established in about 1913  in the city 
of Arvin, in Kern County.  The District is currently operating one state preschool, three 
elementary schools and one intermediate school. 
The District's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  The Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is responsible for establishing GAAP for state and 
local governments through its pronouncements (Statements and Interpretations). 
Governments are also required to follow the pronouncements of the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) issued through November 30, 1989 (when applicable), that do 
not conflict with or contradict GASB pronouncements.  The more significant accounting 
policies established in GAAP and used by the District are discussed below. 

A.  Financial Reporting Entity 

The District's combined financial statements include the accounts of all District 
operations.  The criteria for including organizations as component units within the 
District's reporting entity, as set forth in Section 2100 ofGASB's Codification of 
Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, include whether: 

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

• 

the organization is legally separate (can sue and be sued in their own name) 
the District holds the corporate powers of the organization 
the District appoints a voting majority of the organization's board 
the District is able to impose its will on the organization 
the organization has the potential to impose a financial benefit/burden on the 
District 
there is fiscal dependency by the organization on the District. 

Based on the aforementioned criteria, the District has no component units. 

B.  Basis of Presentation 

Government-Wide Financial Statements: 

The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net position and 
the statement of activities) report information on all of the  nonfiduciary activities 
ofthe District.  Fiduciary funds are excluded from the government-wide financial 
statements.  All of the District's activities were governmental activities.  The 
District had no business-type activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. 
The government-wide statements are prepared using the economic resources 
measurement focus.  This is the same approach used in the preparation of the 

-21-

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30,2014 

fiduciary fund financial statements but differs from the manner in which 
governmental fund financial statements are prepared.  Governmental fund 
financial statements, therefore, include a reconciliation with brief explanations to 
better identify the relationship between the government-wide statements and the 
statements for the governmental funds. 
The government-wide statement of activities presents a comparison between direct 
expenses and program revenues for each function or program of the District's 
governmental activities.  Direct expenses are those that are specifically associated 
with a service, program, or department and are therefore clearly identifiable to a 
particular function.  The District does not allocate indirect expenses to functions 
in the statement of activities.  Program revenues include charges paid by the 
recipients of goods or services offered by a program, as well as grants and 
contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements 
of a particular program.  Revenues which are not classified as program revenues 
are presented as general revenues of the District, with certain exceptions.  The 
comparison of direct expenses with program revenues identifies the extent to 
which each governmental function is self-financing or draws from the general 
revenues of the District. 

Fund Financial Statements: 

Fund financial statements report detailed information about the District.  The focus 
of governmental fund financial statements is on major funds rather than reporting 
funds by type.  Each major governmental fund is presented in a separate column, 
and all nonmajor funds are aggregated into one column.  Fiduciary funds are 
reported by fund type. 
The accounting and financial treatment applied to a fund is determined by its 
measurement focus.  All governmental funds are accounted for using a flow of 
current financial resources measurement focus.  With this measurement focus, 
only current assets and current liabilities are generally included on the balance 
sheet.  The Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances 
for these funds presents increases (i.e., revenues and other financing sources) and 
decreases (i.e., expenditures and other financing uses) in net current assets. 
Fiduciary funds are reported using the economic resources measurement focus. 

C.  Basis of Accounting 

Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in the 
accounts and reported in the financial statements.  Government-wide financial statements 
are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting.  Governmental funds use the modified 
accrual basis of accounting.  Fiduciary funds use the accrual basis of accounting.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30, 2014 

Revenues- Exchange and Non-Exchange Transactions: 

Revenue resulting from exchange transactions, in which each party gives and 
receives essentially equal value, is recorded under the accrual basis when the 
exchange takes place.  On a modified accrual basis, revenue is recorded in the 
fiscal year in which the resources are measurable and become available. 
"Available" means the resources will be collected within the current fiscal year or 
are expected to be collected soon enough thereafter to be used to pay liabilities of 
the current fiscal  year.  For the District, "available" means collectible within the 
current period or within 60 days after year-end. 
Non-exchange transactions, in which the District receives value without directly 
giving equal value in return, include property taxes, grants, and entitlements. 
Under the accrual basis, revenue from property taxes is recognized in the fiscal 
year for which the taxes are levied.  Revenue from grants and entitlements is 
recognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been 
satisfied.  Eligibility requirements include timing requirements, which specify the 
year when the resources are to be used or the fiscal year when use is first 
permitted; matching requirements, in which the District must provide local 
resources to be used for a specific purpose; and expenditure requirements, in 
which the resources are provided to the District on a reimbursement basis.  Under 
the modified accrual basis, revenue from non-exchange transactions must also be 
available before it can be recognized. 

Unearned Revenue: 

Unearned revenue arises when assets are received before revenue recognition 
criteria have been satisfied.  Grants and entitlements received before eligibility 
requirements are met are recorded as unearned revenue.  On governmental fund 
financial statements, receivables associated with non-exchange transactions that 
will not be collected within the availability period have also been recorded as 
unearned revenue. 

Expenses/Expenditures: 

On the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are recognized at the time a liability 
is incurred.  On the modified accrual basis of accounting, expenditures are 
generally recognized in the accounting period in which the related fund liability is 
incurred, as under the accrual basis of accounting.  However, under the modified 
accrual basis of accounting, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures 
related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are recorded only 

-23-

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30, 2014 

when payment is due.  Allocations of cost, such as depreciation and amortization, 
are not recognized in the governmental funds. 
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the 
District's policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as 
they are needed. 

D.  Fund Accounting 

The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds,  each of which is 
considered to be a separate accounting entity.  The operations of each fund are accounted 
for with a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund 
equity, revenues, and expenditures.  District resources are allocated to and accounted for 
in individual funds based upon the purpose for which they are to be spent and the means 
by which spending activities are controlled.  The District's accounts are organized into 
major, nonmajor, and fiduciary funds as follows: 

Major Governmental Funds: 

General Fund is the general operating fund of the District.  It is used to account 
for all financial resources not accounted for and reported in another fund.  The 
General Fund, reported in these financial statements, includes four Funds 
maintained by the District:  The General Fund (Fund 01 ), the Deferred 
Maintenance Fund (Fund 14 ), the Special Reserve Fund for Other Than Capital 
Outlay (Fund 17), and the Special Reserve Fund for Postemployment Benefits 
(Fund 20).  Although Funds 14, 17 and 20 are separate funds authorized in the 
Education Code, they do not meet the definition of a Special Revenue Fund under 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and 
have therefore been combined into the General Fund for financial reporting 
purposes. 

Child Development Fund is used to account for resources committed to child 
development programs maintained by the District. 

Cafeteria Fund is used to account for revenues received and expenditures made to 
operate the District's cafeterias. 

Nonmajor Governmental Funds: 

Debt Service Funds are used to account for all financial resources that are 
restricted, committed or assigned to expenditure for principal and interest.  The 
District maintains the following Nonmajor Debt Service Fund: 

-24-

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30, 2014 

Bond Interest and Redemption Fund is maintained by the County 
Treasurer and is used to account for both the accumulation of resources 
from ad valorem tax levies and the interest and redemption of principal of 
bonds issued by the District. 

Capital Projects Funds are used to account for all financial resources that are 
restricted, committed or assigned to expenditure for capital outlays.  The District 
maintains the following Nonmajor Capital Projects Funds: 

Building Fund is used to account for the acquisition of major governmental 
capital facilities and buildings from the sale of bond proceeds. 

Capital Facilities Fund is used to account for resources received from 
developer impact fees assessed under provisions of the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). 

County School Facilities Fund is used to account for the accumulation and 
expenditure of funds for projects funded under the Leroy F.  Greene School 
Facilities Act of 1998, as established by the Board in accordance with 
Education Code 42840 et seq. 

Special Reserve (Capital Projects) Fund is used to account for the 
accumulation and expenditure of funds for capital outlay purposes, as 
established by the Board in accordance with Education Code 42840 et seq. 

Fiduciary Funds: 

Agency Funds are used to account for assets of others for which the District acts 
as an agent.  The District maintains an Agency Fund for the student body 
accounts, which is used to account for the raising and expending of money to 
promote the general welfare, morale, and educational experience of the student 
body.  The amounts reported for student body funds represent the combined totals 
of all schools within the District. 

E.  Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

Annual budgets are adopted on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America for all government funds.  By state law, the 
District's Governing Board must adopt a final budget no later than July 1.  A public 
hearing must be conducted to receive comments prior to adoption.  The District's 
Governing Board satisfied these requirements. 

-25-

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30, 2014 

These budgets are revised by the District's Governing Board and District Superintendent 
during the year to give consideration to unanticipated income and expenditures.  The 
original and final revised budgets are presented for all major funds in the financial 
statements. 
Formal budgetary integration was employed as a management control device during the 
year for all budgeted funds.  The District employs budget control by minor object and by 
individual appropriation accounts.  Expenditures cannot legally exceed appropriations by 
major object account. 

F.  Encumbrances 

Encumbrance accounting is used in all budgeted funds to reserve portions of applicable 
appropriations for which commitments have been made.  Encumbrances are recorded for 
purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments when they are written.  Encumbrances 
are liquidated when the commitments are paid.  All encumbrances are liquidated on 
June 30. 

G.  Financial Statement Amounts 

1.  Deposits and Investments 

Cash balances held in banks and in revolving funds are insured to $250,000 by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
In accordance with Education Code Section 41 001, the District maintains substantially 
all of its cash in the County Treasury.  The county pools these funds with those of 
other districts in the county and invests the cash.  These pooled funds are carried at 
cost, which approximates market value.  Interest earned is deposited quarterly into 
participating funds.  Any investment losses are proportionately shared by all funds in 
the pool. 
The county is authorized to deposit cash and invest excess funds by California 
Government Code Section 53648 et.  seq.  The funds  maintained by the county are 
either secured by federal depository insurance or are collateralized. 

2.  Stores Inventories and Prepaid Expenditures 

Inventories are recorded using the consumption method, in that inventory acquisitions 
are initially recorded in inventory (asset) accounts, and are charged as expenditures 
when used.  Reported inventories are equally offset by a fund balance reserve, which 
indicates that these amounts are not "available for  appropriation and expenditure" 
even though they are a component of net current assets. 

-26-

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30, 2014 

The valuation of the cafeteria inventory is at cost, determined on a first-in, first-out 
(FIFO) basis. 
The District has the option of reporting an expenditure in governmental funds for 
prepaid items either when purchased or during the benefiting period.  The District has 
chosen to report the expenditure when incurred, except for commodity processing 
charges which are expensed when used. 

3.  Receivables 

All receivables are reported net of estimated uncollectible amounts. 

4.  Capital Assets 

Capital assets are those purchased or acquired with an original cost of $5,000 or more 
and are reported at historical cost or estimated historical cost.  Contributed assets are 
reported at fair market value as of the date received.  Additions, improvements, and 
other capital outlays that significantly extend the useful life of an asset are 
capitalized.  The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value 
of the assets or materially extend the lives of the assets are not capitalized, but are 
expensed as incurred.  Depreciation on all capital assets is computed using a straight(cid:173)
line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30,2014 

6.  Compensated Absences 

All vacation pay, plus related payroll taxes, is accrued when incurred in the 
government-wide financial statements.  A liability for these amounts is reported in the 
governmental funds only if they have matured, for example, as a result of employee 
resignations and retirements. 
Accumulated sick leave benefits are not recognized as liabilities of the District.  The 
District's policy is to record sick leave as an operating expense in the period taken, 
since such benefits do not vest, nor is payment probable; however, unused sick leave 
is added to the creditable service period for calculation of retirement benefits when 
the employee retires. 

7.  Long-Term Obligations 

In the government-wide financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term 
obligations are reported as liabilities in the Statement ofNet Position.  Bond 
premiums are reported as other financing sources in the period the bonds are issued. 
Bond discounts, as well as issuance costs (except bond insurance), are reported as 
other financing uses in the period the bonds are issued.  Bond insurance costs are 
deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using the effective-interest method. 
Bonds payable are reported net of applicable bond premium or discount.  Bond 
insurance costs are reported as deferred outflows of resources and amortized over the 
term of the related debt. 
In the fund financial statements, governmental funds recognize bond premiums and 
discounts as well as bond issuance costs, during the current period.  The face amount 
of the debt issued, premiums, or discounts is reported as other financing sources/uses. 

8.  Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

9.  Governmental Activities Net Position (Government-Wide) 

Governmental activities net position is divided into three components: 

•  Invested in capital assets, net of related debt- consist ofthe historical cost of 

capital assets less accumulated depreciation and less any debt that remains 
outstanding that was used to finance those assets. 

-29-

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30,2014 

•  Restricted - consist of net position balances that are restricted by the 

District's creditors (for example, through debt covenants), by the state 
enabling legislation (through restrictions on shared revenues), by grantors 
(both federal and state), and by other contributors. 

•  Unrestricted- all other net position balances are reported in this category. 

10.  Governmental Fund Balances 

In the governmental fund financial statements, fund balances are classified as follows: 

•  Nonspendable- Amounts that cannot be spent either because they are in a 

nonspendable form or because they are legally or contractually required to be 
maintained intact. 

•  Restricted - Amounts that can be spent only for specific purposes because of 

state or federal laws, or externally imposed conditions by grantors or 
creditors. 

•  Committed - Amounts that can be used only for specific purposes 

determined by a formal action by Board resolution.  This includes the Budget 
Reserve Account. 

•  Assigned - Amounts that are designated by the Board for a particular 

purpose. 

•  Unassigned- All amounts not included in other spendable classifications. 

Restricted balances at June 30, 2014 are as follows: 

AVID Scholarship Program 
California Clean Energy Jobs Act (Prop 39) 
Child Nutrition:  School Programs 
Common Core State Standards Implementation Funds

11.  Use of Restricted Resources 

When an expense is incurred that can be paid using either restricted or unrestricted 
resources (net position), the District's policy is to first apply the expense toward 
restricted resources and then toward unrestricted resources.  In governmental funds, 
the District's policy is to  first apply the expenditure toward restricted fund balance 
and then to other, less-restrictive classifications- committed and then assigned fund 
balances before using unassigned fund balances. 

12.  Interfund Activity 

Interfund activity is reported as either loans, services provided, reimbursements or 
transfers.  Loans are reported as interfund receivables and payables as appropriate and 
are subject to elimination upon consolidation.  Services provided, deemed to be at 
market or near market rates, are treated as revenues and expenditures/expenses. 
Reimbursements are when one fund incurs a cost, charges the appropriate benefiting 
fund and reduces its related cost as a reimbursement.  All other interfund transactions 
are treated as transfers.  Transfers between governmental funds are netted as part of 
the reconciliation to the government-wide financial statements. 

13.  Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) Allocation/Property Tax 

The District's LCFF allocation is received from a combination of local property taxes 
and state apportionments.  The new funding formula replaces the old system of 
"revenue-limits"-- general purpose funding from the state, which was based on 
complex historical formulas and made up approximately 70% of a district's budget -(cid:173)
with a per-student base grant that varies by grade span. 
The transition to the new formula begins with the 2013-14  school year, but full 
implementation of the new funding formula is slated to take eight years.  Although 
the majority of school districts will receive more funding under the new formula, 
districts that were already receiving more funding than what they would get under 
LCFF are protected by a provision specifying that no district will receive less state aid 
than it received in 2012-13. 
The county is responsible for assessing, collecting, and apportioning property taxes. 
Taxes are levied for each fiscal year on taxable real and personal property in the 
county.  The levy is based on the assessed values as of each January 1st, the lien date 
for both secured and unsecured property.  Property taxes on the secured roll are due in 
two installments on November 1st and February 1st following the lien date, and 
become delinquent if not paid by December lOth and April  lOth, respectively.  Both 
installments of taxes due on the secured roll may be paid by December lOth,  at the 
option of each property owner.  Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due on the 
lien date and become delinquent if not paid by August 31st following the lien date.

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30, 2014 

Secured property taxes are recorded as revenue when apportioned, in the fiscal year of 
the levy.  The county apportions secured property tax revenue in accordance with the 
alternate method of distribution prescribed by Section 4705 of the California Revenue 
and Taxation Code.  This alternate method provides for crediting each applicable 
fund with its total secured taxes upon completion of the secured tax roll -(cid:173)
approximately October 1st of each year. 
The County Auditor reports the amount of the District's allocated property tax revenue 
to the California Department of Education.  Property taxes are recorded as local 
control funding formula sources by the District. 
The California Department of Education reduces the District's LCFF allocation by the 
District's local property tax revenue.  The balance is paid from the State General 
Fund, and is known as the State Apportionment. 
The District's LCFF allocation is the amount of general purpose tax revenue, per 
average daily attendance (ADA) by grade span, that the District is entitled to by law. 
This amount is multiplied by the second period ADA to derive the District's base 
allocation.  In addition, there is supplemental funding for certain student subgroups, 
concentration funding and other add-ons.

Disclosures Relating to Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely 

affect the fair value of an investment.  Generally, the longer the maturity of an 
investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market 
interest rates. 

Information about the sensitivity of the fair values ofthe District's investments to 
market interest rate fluctuations is provided by the following table that shows the

4.  Disclosures Relating to  Credit Risk 

Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its 
obligation to the holder of the investment.  This is measured by the assignment of 
a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  Presented 
below is the minimum rating required by (where applicable) the California 
Government Code, the District's investment policy, and the actual rating as of 
year-end for each investment type.  The column marked "exempt from 
disclosure" identifies those investment types for which GASB No. 40 does not

Funding Policy 

The District has no invested plan assets accumulated for payment of future benefits. 
The District has established a Fund for retiree benefits.  However, the assets in this Fund 
have not been contributed into an irrevocable trust and are therefore not considered 
invested plan assets.  This Fund has a current balance of$3,801,139.  Currently, the 
District pays for the cost of these benefits out of the General Fund on a pay-as-you-go 
basis and does not use any of the funds in the Special Reserve Fund for Postemployment 
Benefits.  During the year, expenditures of$956,083 (including the implicit rate subsidy) 
were paid for these benefits. 

Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation 

The District's annual other postemployment benefits (OPEB) cost/( expense) is calculated 
based on an annual required contribution (ARC), an amount actuarially determined in 
accordance with the parameters ofGASB Statement No. 45.  The ARC represents a level 
of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover normal cost each year, 
and amortize any unfunded actuarial liabilities over a period not to exceed thirty years. 
The District has elected to use a thirty-year amortization.  A table showing the 
components of the District's annual OPEB cost for the year, the amount actually paid 
from the plan, and changes in the District's net OPEB obligation is as follows:

Funded Status and Funding Progress 

As of July 1, 2012, the most recent actuarial valuation date, the District's unfunded 
actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) was $21,929,457.  The annual payroll for active 
employees covered by the plan in the actuarial valuation for the 2013-2014 fiscal year 
was $17,337,966, for a ratio of the UAAL to covered payroll of 126.48%. 
Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates ofthe value ofreported amounts 
and assumptions about future terminations, mortality, and healthcare cost trends. 
Actuarially determined amounts are subject to continual revision as actuarial value of 
plan assets is changing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits. 

-44-

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30, 2014 

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions 

Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan 
(the plan as understood by the employer and plan members) and include the types of 
benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of 
benefit costs between the employer and plan members to that point.  The actuarial 
methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce the effect 
on short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, 
consistent with the long-term perspective of the calculations. 
In the July 1, 2012 actuarial valuation, the projected unit credit actuarial cost method was 
used.  The actuarial assumptions included a rate of 4.0% to discount expected liabilities 
to the valuation date, which is the actuaries best estimate of expected long-term plan 
experience given the types of assets available for the District for investment purposes. 
The initial medical, prescription drug, and behavioral health trend rates were 8%, reduced 
by decrements to an ultimate rate of 5.0% for medical after 3 years.  The initial and 
ultimate dental and vision trend rates were 4%.  Mortality, disability and retirement rates 
are from the RP-2000 Mortality Tables.  The UAAL is being amortized as a level 
percentage of projected payrolls. 

The unfunded net obligation for other postemployment benefits is $5,992,627.  Annual 
amounts to amortize this debt are as follows:

Operating Leases 

The District has entered into various operating leases for equipment with lease terms in 
excess of one year.  None of these agreements contain purchase options.  All the 
agreements contain a termination clause providing for cancellation after a specified 
number of days written notice to lessors, but it is unlikely that the District will cancel any 
of the agreements prior to the expiration date.  The District will receive no sublease rental 
revenues nor pay any contingent rentals for these operating leases.  Operating lease rental 
expense for the year ended June 30, 2014 under these operating leases was $7,014.

management and approval of operating budgets, independent of any influence by the 
member districts beyond representation on the governing board. 
Each district pays premiums and fees commensurate with the level of coverage or services 
requested, and shares surpluses and deficits proportionate to its participation in each JP A. 
Each JP A is independently accountable for its fiscal matters, and maintains its own 
accounting records. 
The District's share of year-end assets, liabilities, or fund equity has not been calculated

This schedule discloses the District's financial trends by displaying past years' data along 
with budget information for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015.  These financial trend disclosures 
are used to evaluate the District's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of 
time. 

The General Fund balance has decreased by $3,392,792 over the past two years.  The 

fiscal year 2014-2015 budget projects an increase of$869,061 (10.6%).  For a District this size, the 
state recommends available reserves of at least 3% of total General Fund expenditures, transfers 
out, and other uses (total outgo), but not less than $60,000.  The District's available reserves are in 
excess of this suggested balance. 

The District has incurred operating deficits in two of the past three years, but does not 

anticipate incurring an operating deficit during the 2014-2015 fiscal year. 

Total long-term debt has increased by $895,232 over the past two years. 

Average daily attendance has decreased by 35 over the past two years.  During fiscal year 

2014-2015, no change in ADA is anticipated.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL 

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE 

AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF 

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE 

WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

Board of Trustees 
Arvin Union School District 
Arvin, California: 

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial  statements of the 
governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Arvin 
Union School District (the District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014, and the related notes 
to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's basic financial  statements and 
have issued our report thereon dated December 4, 2014. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In plmming and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District's 
internal control over financial  reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the 
financial  statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the District's internal control.  Accordingly, we do  not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness ofthe District's internal control. 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the preceding 
paragraph and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material  weaknesses or 
significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified.  However,  as  described in the 
accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs, we identified a certain deficiency 
in  internal control that we consider to be a material weakness and other deficiencies in 
internal control that we consider to  be significant deficiencies. 

A deficiency in  internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not 
allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis.  A material 
weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there 
is  a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the District's financial statements

(559) 438-8740 • FAX 438-8746 

-80-

will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.  We consider the 
deficiency described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings artd Questioned Costs to be a 
material weakness.  This material weakness is described in the accompanying Schedule of 
Findings and Questioned Costs as Item 2014-1. 

A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control 
that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those 
charged with governance.  We consider the deficiencies described in the accompanying 
Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs to be significant deficiencies.  These significant 
deficiencies are described in the accompanying Schedule ofFindings and Questioned Costs 
as Items 2014-2 and 2014-3. 

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part ofobtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions 
of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have 
a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts.  However, 
providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, 
and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  The results of our tests disclosed no 
instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under 
Government Auditing Standards. 

The District's Responses to Findings 

The District's responses to the findings identified in our audit are described in the 
accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs.  The District's responses were 
not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, 
accordingly, we express no opinion on them. 

Purpose of this Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the District's internal control or on compliance.  This report is an integral part of an audit 
performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District's 
internal control and compliance.  Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any 
other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON COMPLIANCE 

FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL 

OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY OMB CIRCULAR A-133 

Board of Trustees 
Arvin  Union  School  District 
Arvin, California: 

Report on  Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

We  have audited Arvin Union  School  District's (the District) compliance with the types of compliance 

requirements described  in  the OMB Circular A-133 Compliance Supplement that could  have a direct and  material 
effect on each ofthe District's major federal  programs for the year ended June 30,2014.  The District's major 
federal  programs are  identified in  the Summary of Auditors'  Results section of the accompanying Schedule of 
Findings and  Questioned Costs. 

Management's Responsibility 

Management is  responsible for compliance with the  requirements of laws,  regulations, contracts, and 
grants applicable to  its federal  programs. 

Auditors' Responsibility 

Our responsibility is  to express an  opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal 
programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred  to above.  We conducted 
our audit of compliance in  accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in  the  United States of 
America; the standards applicable to  financial  audits contained  in  Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the  United States; and  OMB Circular A-133 , Audits of States,  Local 
Governments,  and Non-Profit Organizations.  Those standards and  OMB  Circular A-133  require that we 
plan and  perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could  have a direct and  material  effect on  a major federal 
program occurred.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District's 
compliance with those requirements and  performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in 
the circumstances. 

We  believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal  program.  However, our audit does not provide a legal  determination of the  District's compliance. 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In  our opinion, the District complied, in  all  material  respects, with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and  material  effect on  each of its major federal  programs for the 
year ended June 30, 2014.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of the District is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  In planning and performing our audit of 
compliance, we considered the District's internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could 
have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal 
program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, 
we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 

compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, 
to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a 
timely basis.  A material weakness in internal control over compliance is  a deficiency, or combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material 
noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and 
corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to 
merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 

paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that 
might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control 
over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, material weaknesses may exist that have 
not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is  solely to describe the scope of our testing 

of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements ofOMB Circular 
A-133.  Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose. 

Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards 
Required by OMB Circular A-133 

We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the 

aggregate remaining fund information of the Arvin Union School District, as of and for the year ended June 30, 
2014, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's basic financial 
statements.  We issued our report thereon dated December 4, 2014, which contained unmodified opinions on those 
financial statements.  Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that 
collectively comprise the basic financial statements.  The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal 
awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by OMB  Circular A -13 3 and is not a required 
part of the basic financial statements.  Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from 
and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. 
The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and 
certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying 
accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements 
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America.  In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated in all material 
respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

compliance requirements described  in  the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 5, Education, 
Division  1.5.  Education Audit Appeals Panel, Chapter 3. Audits of California K-12  Local  Educational 
Agencies for the year ended June 30, 2014.

The District's management is  responsible for the District's compliance with the applicable

Auditors' Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the District's compliance with the applicable

Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and Standards and 
Procedures for Audits of California K-12 Local Educational Agencies, prescribed in the

necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our compliance audit provides a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.  Our compliance audit does not provide a legal determination on the 
District's compliance with these requirements.  We selected and tested transactions and

This section identifies the significant deficiencies, material weaknesses, and instances of 
noncompliance related to the financial statements that are required to be reported in accordance 
with paragraphs 5.18 through 5.20 of Government Auditing Standards. 

2014-1 

Internal Control  [30000] 

Federal Program Information 

This finding does not relate to any Federal programs. 

Criteria or Specific Requirement 

A strong internal control structure is necessary to provide management with reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance that financial data are recorded, processed, summarized, and 
reported consistent with the assertions embodied in the financial statements. 

Condition 

There is inadequate control over financial transactions of the Student Body Funds because 
of a general lack of segregation of duties due to a limited number of employees.  We 
believe this to be a material weakness. 

Questioned Costs 

There were no questioned costs related to this finding. 

-88-

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 

Perspective 

This weakness applies to the entire internal control structure over the Student Body Funds. 

If financial data were recorded, processed, summarized, or reported in a manner which 
was not consistent with the assertions embodied in the financial statements, management 
may not be able to detect such errors within a reasonable period of time. 

There are not enough District employees involved in these Funds to adequately separate 
the duties. 

Recommendation 

While we realize that budgetary considerations may preclude the hiring of additional 
employees, we still must advise the Administration of this situation and recommend that 
duties be segregated as much as possible in order to enhance internal controls. 

Views ofResponsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions 

The Administration has segregated duties as much as possible with existing personnel, 
and believes that it is impractical and not cost effective to increase the number of 
employees.

Internal Control  [30000] 

Federal Program Information 

This finding does not relate to any Federal programs. 

-89-

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 

Criteria or Specific Requirement 

A strong internal control structure is necessary to provide management with reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance that financial data are recorded, processed, summarized, and 
reported consistent with the assertions embodied in the financial statements.  Pursuant to 
Education Code Section 41 017, the County Office of Education may authorize a school 
district to deposit any miscellaneous receipts into one or more clearing accounts.  Money 
deposited into those accounts shall be paid into the County Treasury within the time 
periods specified pursuant to Education Code Section 4100 1, which states that all 
deposits and payments required by this Code Section shall be made daily, unless the 
County Superintendent of Schools authorizes them to be made weekly or otherwise, but 
in no event less frequently than monthly. 

Condition 

Miscellaneous cash receipts in the General Fund Clearing Account for 2013-2014 were 
not being transferred into Cash in County Treasury on a consistent basis.  In addition, 
there is no documentation regarding the makeup of the balance remaining in the account 
at the end of any given month. 

Questioned Costs 

There were no questioned costs related to this finding. 

Perspective 

Most of the cash balance remaining in the Clearing Account at year-end is believed to be 
from donations, grants, and other local revenue.  The balance in the clearing account at 
June 30, 2014 was booked as accounts receivable in  order the report the revenue in the 
proper period. 

When cash is not deposited intact, on a regular basis,  it leaves more opportunity for the 
misappropriation of these funds.  In addition, the cash in the Clearing account is not 
earning as much interest for the District as it would if the funds were deposited in the 
County Treasury.  When transferred to Cash in County Treasury, the cash will be part of 
a common investment pool and will earn interest.

ARVIN UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 

SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 

The personnel responsible for depositing this cash did not keep up with the process of 
making deposits to transfer money from the account to Cash in County Treasury on at 
least a monthly basis. 

Recommendation 

Miscellaneous cash receipts should be deposited into the County Treasury on at least a 
monthly basis.  The District should continually mai~tain documentation of the items that 
comprise the account balance. 

Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions 

The Administration will comply with this recommendation.  The Administration 
understands the internal control issues associated with the recordation of cash received 
and the timely transfer of cash to the County Treasury, and will follow these procedures 
in the future.

Internal Control  [30000]  - Bear Mountain Elementary School 

Student Body Fund 

Federal Program Information 

This finding does not relate to any Federal programs. 

Criteria or Specific Requirement 

A strong internal control structure is necessary to provide management with reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance that financial data are recorded, processed, summarized, and 
reported consistent with the assertions embodied in the financial statements. 

Condition 

Out of twelve randomly selected expenditures tested, nine invoices were for inappropriate 
expenditures.  The expenditures were for various items including curriculum supplies, 
music supplies, and office supplies and equipment.

Student Body funds are being used to pay for expenditures which the District should be 
paying for, thereby depleting the Student Body accounts inappropriately. 

The authorization and approval procedure for Student Body purchases, in accordance 
with established guidelines, was not followed. 

Recommendation 

All purchases should be approved in advance by individuals with the authority to approve 
as well as the knowledge to recognize appropriate expenditures for the Student Body 
Funds to pay.  These individuals should be trained to recognize prohibited purchases and 
should be provided with a list of prohibited purchases.  The General Fund should 
reimburse the Bear Mountain Elementary Student Body Fund $3,912 for the questioned 
costs. 

Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions 

For the 2014-2015 school year, an internal audit of internal accounting controls will be 
conducted periodically.  The General Fund will reimburse the Bear Mountain 
Elementary Student Body Fund $3,912 for the questioned costs.

There were insufficient numbers of 
employees to adequately separate 
duties in the Student Body Funds. 
Such separation of duties would 
enhance internal control. 

Miscellaneous cash receipts in the 
General Fund Clearing Account were 
not being transferred into the County 
Treasury on a consistent basis, and 
there was no documentation of the 
balance remaining in the account in 
any given month.  These receipts 
should be deposited at least monthly, 
and the District should continually 
maintain documentation of the items 
that comprise the account balance. 

Some randomly selected invoices did 
not have proper cancellation.  All 
invoices should have clear markings 
on the face of the documents, 
indicating that payment has been 
made, to avoid duplicate payments. 

For the Title I Program and the 
Nutrition Cluster, some randomly 
selected expenditures were not 
cancelled upon payment.  All 
invoices should have clear markings 
on the face of the documents, 
indicating that payment has been 
made, to avoid duplicate payments. 

For the Bear Mountain Elementary 
School Student Body Fund, one 
randomly selected expenditure was 
a donation to a 501(c)(3) in honor of 
an individual, which is a prohibited 
expenditure.  All expenditures 
should be approved in advance by 
an individual who can determine 
appropriate expenditures.

Upon  the  occurrence  of  a  Designated  Material  Event  described  in  Section  6(a)

the Resolution. 

SECTION 7.  Termination  of  Reporting  Obligation.    The  District’s  obligations  under  this 
Disclosure Agreement shall terminate when the District is no longer an obligated person with respect to

Bonds. 

SECTION 8.  Dissemination Agent.  The District may, from time to time, appoint or engage an 
alternate or successor Dissemination Agent to assist in carrying out the District’s obligations under this 
Disclosure Agreement, and may discharge any such Dissemination Agent, with or without appointing a 
successor Dissemination Agent. 

The Dissemination  Agent  shall  be  entitled  to  the  protections,  limitations  from  liability, 
immunities  and  indemnities  provided  to  the  Paying  Agent  as  set  forth  in  the  Resolution  which  are 

 
 

D-4 

 

incorporated by reference herein.  The Dissemination Agent agrees to perform only those duties of the 
Dissemination  Agent  specifically  set  forth  in  the  Agreement,  and  no  implied  duties,  covenants  or 
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Dissemination Agent. 

The Dissemination Agent shall have no duty or obligation to review the Annual Report nor shall 
the Dissemination Agent be responsible for filing any Annual Report not provided to it by the District in a 
timely  manner  in  a  form  suitable  for  filing.    In  accepting  the  appointment  under  this  Agreement,  the 
Dissemination Agent is not acting in a fiduciary capacity to the registered holders or beneficial owners of 
the Bonds, the District, or any other party or person. 

The Dissemination  Agent may  consult  with  counsel of its choice  and shall be protected  in any 
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.  No provision of 
this Agreement shall require the Dissemination Agent to risk or advance or expend its own funds or incur 
any  financial  liability.  The  Dissemination  Agent  shall  have  the  right  to  resign  from  its  duties  as 
Dissemination  Agent  under  this  Agreement  upon  thirty  days’  written  notice  to  the  District.  The 
Dissemination  Agent  shall  be  entitled  to  compensation  for  its  services  as  Dissemination  Agent  and 
reimbursement for its out-of-pocket expenses, attorney’s fees, costs and advances made or incurred in the 
performance of its duties under this Agreement in accordance with its written fee schedule provided to the 
District,  as  such  fee  schedule  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time  in  writing.  The  District  agrees  to 
indemnify  and  hold  the  Dissemination  Agent  harmless  from  and  against  any  cost,  claim,  expense,  or 
liability related to or arising from the acceptance of and performance of the duties of the Dissemination 
Agent hereunder, provided the Dissemination Agent shall not be indemnified to the extent of its willful 
misconduct or negligence.  The obligations of the District under this Section shall survive the termination 
or discharge of this Agreement and the Bonds. 

SECTION 9.  Amendment.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Disclosure Agreement, 
the  District  may  amend  this  Disclosure  Agreement  under  the  following  conditions,  provided  no 
amendment  to  this  Agreement  shall  be  made  that  affects  the  rights,  duties  or  obligations  of  the 
Dissemination Agent without its written consent: 

(a) 

The amendment may be made only in connection with a change in circumstances 
that arises from a change in legal requirements, change in law or change in the identity, nature or status of 
the obligated person, or type of business conducted; 

(b) 

This  Disclosure  Agreement,  as  amended,  would  have  complied  with  the 
requirements of the Rule at the time of the primary offering of the Bonds, after taking into account any 
amendments or interpretations of the Rule, as well as any change in circumstances; and 

(c) 

The amendment does not materially impair the interests of Holders, as determined 
either by parties unaffiliated with the District or another obligated person (such as Bond Counsel) or by 
the  written  approval  of  the  Bondholders;  provided,  that  the  Annual  Report  containing  the  amended 
operating data or financial information shall  explain, in  narrative form, the  reasons for the amendment 
and the impact of the change in the type of operating data or financial information being provided. 

SECTION 10.  Additional  Information.  If the District chooses to include  any information from 
any document or notice of occurrence of a Designated Material Event or a Material Event in addition to 
that  which  is  specifically  required  by  this  Disclosure  Agreement,  the  District  shall  have  no  obligation 
under this Disclosure Agreement to update such information or to include it in any future disclosure or 
notice of occurrence of a Designated Material Event or Material Event. 

 
 

D-5 

 

Nothing in this Disclosure Agreement shall be deemed to prevent the District from disseminating 
any other information,  using  the means of dissemination set forth in this Disclosure Agreement or  any 
other  means  of  communication,  or  including  any  other  information  in  any  Annual  Report  or  notice  of 
occurrence of a Designated Material Event or Material Event, in addition to that which is required by this 
Disclosure Agreement. 

SECTION 11.  Default.  The District shall give notice to the MSRB through the EMMA System 
of any failure to provide the Annual Report when the same is due hereunder, which notice shall be given 
prior to July 1 of that year.  In the event of a failure of the District to comply with any provision of this 
Disclosure  Agreement,  any  Bondholder  may  take  such  actions  as  may  be  necessary  and  appropriate, 
including seeking mandate or specific performance by court order, to cause the District to comply with its 
obligations  under  this  Disclosure  Agreement.    A  default  under  this  Disclosure  Agreement  shall  not  be 
deemed an event of default under the Resolution, and the sole remedy under this Disclosure Agreement in 
the event of any failure of the District to comply with this Disclosure  Agreement  shall be an action  to

APPENDIX E 

BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY SYSTEM 

The  information  in  this  Appendix  concerning  DTC  and  DTC’s  book-entry  system  has  been 
obtained from sources that the District believes to be reliable, but the District takes no responsibility for 
the accuracy or completeness thereof.  The District cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC, 
DTC Direct Participants or Indirect Participants will distribute to the Beneficial Owners (a) payments of 
interest, principal or premium, if any, as to the Bonds, (b) Bonds representing ownership interest in or 
other confirmation or ownership interest in the Bonds, or (c) redemption or other notices sent to DTC or 
Cede & Co., its nominee, as the registered owner of the Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis or 
that DTC, DTC Direct Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this 
Official Statement.  The current “Rules” applicable to DTC are on file with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission  and  the  current  “Procedures”  of  DTC  to  be  followed  in  dealing  with  DTC  Direct 
Participants are on file with DTC. 

General 

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the 
Bonds.    The  Bonds  will  be  issued  as  fully-registered  securities  registered  in  the  name  of  Cede  &  Co. 
(DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of 
DTC.    One  fully-registered  Bond  certificate  will  be  issued  for  each  maturity  of  the  Bonds,  in  the 
aggregate principal amount or Maturity Value of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. 

DTC,  the  world’s  largest  securities  depository,  is  a  limited-purpose  trust  company  organized 
under  the  New  York  Banking  Law,  a  “banking  organization”  within  the  meaning  of  the  New  York 
Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of 
the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions 
of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 
3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money 
market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with 
DTC.    DTC  also  facilitates  the  post-trade  settlement  among  Direct  Participants  of  sales  and  other 
securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and 
pledges  between  Direct  Participants’  accounts.    This  eliminates  the  need  for  physical  movement  of 
securities certificates.  Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, 
banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations.  DTC is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”).  DTCC is the holding company 
for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which 
are registered clearing agencies.  DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries.  Access to the 
DTC  system  is  also  available  to  others  such  as  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  securities  brokers  and  dealers, 
banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship 
with a Direct Participant,  either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).  DTC  has a Standard & 
Poor’s rating of AA+.  The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.  More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.  Such information 
is not incorporated herein by reference. 

Purchases  of  Bonds  under  the  DTC  system  must  be  made  by  or  through  Direct  Participants, 
which  will  receive  a  credit  for  the  Bonds  on  DTC’s  records.    The  ownership  interest  of  each  actual 
purchaser  of  each  Bond  (“Beneficial  Owner”)  is  in  turn  to  be  recorded  on  the  Direct  and  Indirect 
Participants’  records.  Beneficial  Owners  will  not  receive  written  confirmation  from  DTC  of  their 
purchase.  Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of 

E-1

 

the  transaction, as well  as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or  Indirect Participant 
through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction.  Transfers of ownership interests in the 
Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on 
behalf of Beneficial Owners.  Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership 
interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued. 

To  facilitate  subsequent  transfers,  all  Bonds  deposited  by  Direct  Participants  with  DTC  are 
registered  in  the  name  of  DTC’s  partnership  nominee,  Cede  &  Co.,  or  such  other  name  as  may  be 
requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration 
in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. 
DTC  has  no  knowledge  of  the  actual  Beneficial  Owners  of  the  Bonds;  DTC’s  records  reflect  only  the 
identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be 
the Beneficial Owners.  The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account 
of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 

Conveyance  of  notices  and  other  communications  by  DTC  to  Direct  Participants,  by  Direct 
Participants  to  Indirect  Participants,  and  by  Direct  Participants  and  Indirect  Participants  to  Beneficial 
Owners  will  be  governed  by  arrangements  among  them,  subject  to  any  statutory  or  regulatory 
requirements as may be in effect from time to time. 

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC.  If less than all of the Bonds within an issue are being 
redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in 
such issue to be redeemed. 

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to 
Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures.  Under its 
usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the District (or the Paying Agent on behalf thereof) as 
soon as possible after the record date.  The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting 
rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a 
listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). 

Principal,  premium,  if  any,  interest  payments  and  redemption  proceeds  on  the  Bonds  will  be 
made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  
DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding 
detail information from the District or Paying Agent, on payable date in accordance with their respective 
holdings shown on DTC’s records.  Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by 
standing  instructions  and  customary  practices,  as  is  the  case  with  securities  held  for  the  accounts  of 
customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant 
and not of DTC, the Paying Agent, or the District, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as 
may  be  in  effect  from  time  to  time.    Payment  of  principal,  premium,  if  any,  interest  payments  and 
redemption  proceeds  to  Cede  &  Co.  (or  such  other  nominee  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized 
representative  of  DTC)  is  the  responsibility  of  the  District  or  the  Paying  Agent,  disbursement  of  such 
payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to 
the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. 

A Beneficial Owner shall give notice to elect to have its Bonds purchased or tendered, through its 
Participant, to the Paying Agent, and shall effect delivery of such Bonds by causing the Direct Participant 
to  transfer  the  Participant’s  interest  in  the  Bonds,  on  DTC’s  records,  to  the  Paying  Agent.    The 
requirement for physical delivery of Bonds in connection with an optional tender or a mandatory purchase 
will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Bonds are transferred by Direct Participants on 

 
 

E-2 

 

DTC’s  records  and  followed  by  a  book-entry  credit  of  tendered  Bonds  to  the  Paying  Agent’s  DTC 
account. 

DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at any time 
by giving reasonable notice to the District or the Paying Agent.  Under such circumstances, in the event 
that a successor depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered. 

The District may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or 

a successor securities depository).  In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and delivered. 

The  information  in  this  Appendix  concerning  DTC  and  DTC’s  book-entry  system  has  been 
obtained from sources that the District believes to be reliable, but the District takes no responsibility for 
the accuracy thereof.
