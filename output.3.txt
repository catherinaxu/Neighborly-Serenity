In the opinion of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, San Francisco, California, Bond Counsel, subject, however, to certain qualifications described 
in this Official Statement, under existing law, the interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and such interest is not 
an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations, although for purposes of computing the 
alternative minimum tax imposed on certain corporations, such interest is taken into account in determining certain income and earnings. In the further opinion 
of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is exempt from State of California personal income tax. See “LEGAL MATTERS — Tax Matters.”

ELK GROVE FINANCE AUTHORITY 
SPECIAL TAX REVENUE BONDS

SERIES 2015

Dated: Date of Delivery 

Due: September 1, as shown on inside cover

The Special Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2015 (the “Bonds”) are being issued by the Elk Grove Finance Authority (the “Authority”) to assist the City of Elk 
Grove, Sacramento County, California (the “City”) in the financing and refinancing of certain improvements for its Community Facilities District No. 2003-1 (Poppy 
Ridge) (“Poppy Ridge CFD”) and East Franklin Community Facilities District No. 2002-1 (“East Franklin CFD” and together, the “Districts” as described herein).  
All of the proceedings of the City to form the Districts and to levy the special taxes (described herein) for the construction and acquisition of the improvements 
have been undertaken pursuant to the Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982, as amended, being California Government Code Section 53311, et seq. 
(the “Act”).

Refunding of Prior Bonds. In 2005 and 2006 the City issued three series of bonds (collectively, the “Prior CFD Bonds”) for the Districts to finance and 
refinance the construction and acquisition of certain public improvements related to new development in the Districts.  The Bonds are being issued to refund the 
Prior CFD Bonds through the issuance of a series of special tax bonds for each District (the “East Franklin CFD Bonds” and “Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds,” and 
together, the “CFD Bonds,” as described herein) to be issued by the City concurrently with the Bonds. Proceeds will also be used to pay the premium for the 
Bond Insurance Policy and Reserve Policy, provided by BAM, for each series of CFD Bonds and to pay costs of issuance, as described below. to pay the costs 
of issuance and to provide money for certain additional improvements with respect to the Districts. Proceeds of the Bonds will primarily be used by the Authority 
to purchase the CFD Bonds and refund prior bonds issued by the Authority to purchase the Prior CFD Bonds. 

Security and Sources of Payment for the Bonds and CFD Bonds.  The Bonds are payable solely from “Revenues” pledged by the Authority under the 
Indenture (described herein), which consist primarily of payments received by the Authority from the City on the CFD Bonds, which payments are secured by 
liens of unpaid special taxes authorized under the Act, as more fully described herein. Each respective series of CFD Bonds is payable from special taxes (net of 
administration expenses) levied within the respective District and paid to the Authority as debt service on the respective CFD Bonds. Installments of principal and 
interest sufficient to meet annual CFD Bonds debt service are included on the regular county tax bills sent to owners of property against which there are unpaid 
special taxes. Scheduled payments under the CFD Bonds are calculated to be sufficient to permit the Authority to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds 
when due.  See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT THEREFOR.”

Bond Terms.  The Bonds will be issued in denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple of $5,000.  Interest is payable semiannually on each March 1 
and September 1, commencing March 1, 2016.  The Bonds will be initially issued only in book-entry form and registered to Cede & Co. as nominee of The 
Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”), which will act as securities depository of the Bonds. Principal and interest (and premium, if any) on the 
Bonds is payable by the Trustee to DTC, which remits such payments to its Participants for subsequent distribution to the registered owners as shown on the 
Trustee’s books. See “THE BONDS - Bond Terms” and “– Book-Entry Only System.” 

Redemption.  The Bonds are subject to optional redemption, sinking fund redemption and mandatory special redemption from the proceeds of early 

redemption of the East Franklin CFD Bonds or the Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds as a result of special tax prepayments.  See “THE BONDS – Redemption.”

Risk Factors. The Bonds may not be appropriate investments for certain individuals.  See “RISK FACTORS” for a discussion of the risk factors 

that should be considered in evaluating the investment quality of the Bonds.

Bond Insurance. The scheduled payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds maturing on September 1 in the years 2030 through 2036, inclusive, 
and September 1, 2038 (collectively, the “Insured Bonds”), when due will be guaranteed under a municipal bond insurance policy to be issued concurrently with 
the delivery of the Insured Bonds by Build America Mutual Assurance Company (“BAM”).  See “INTRODUCTION – Bond Insurance.”

THE  BONDS ARE  SPECIAL  OBLIGATIONS  OF  THE AUTHORITY  PAYABLE  SOLELY  FROM AND  SECURED  SOLELY  BY  THE  REVENUES AND 
FUNDS PLEDGED THEREFOR IN THE INDENTURE.  THE BONDS ARE NOT A DEBT OR LIABILITY OF THE CITY, THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR ANY 
POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS THEREOF OTHER THAN THE AUTHORITY TO THE LIMITED EXTENT DESCRIBED HEREIN, AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND 
CREDIT OF THE AUTHORITY, THE CITY, THE STATE OR ANY OF ITS POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS ARE PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OF, 
PREMIUM, IF ANY, OR INTEREST ON THE BONDS AND NEITHER THE AUTHORITY (EXCEPT TO THE LIMITED EXTENT DESCRIBED HEREIN), THE 
CITY, THE STATE NOR ANY OF ITS POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS IS LIABLE THEREFOR, NOR IN ANY EVENT SHALL THE BONDS OR ANY INTEREST 
THEREON  BE  PAYABLE  OUT  OF ANY  FUNDS  OR  PROPERTIES  OTHER THAN THOSE  OF THE AUTHORITY AS  SET  FORTH  IN THE  INDENTURE.  
NEITHER THE BONDS NOR THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON THE EAST FRANKLIN CFD BONDS OR THE POPPY RIDGE CFD BONDS 
CONSTITUTES AN INDEBTEDNESS OF THE AUTHORITY, THE CITY, THE STATE OR ANY OF ITS POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN THE MEANING OF 
ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY DEBT LIMITATION OR RESTRICTION.  THE AUTHORITY HAS NO TAXING POWER.

OFFICIAL STATEMENT 

 

 

$90,630,000 

ELK GROVE FINANCE AUTHORITY  
SPECIAL TAX REVENUE BONDS 

Series 2015 

 
 
This Official Statement, including the cover page and the appendices hereto, is provided 
to  furnish  information  regarding  the  issuance  by  the  Elk  Grove  Finance  Authority  (the 
"Authority") of its Special Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2015 (the "Bonds") in the aggregate 
principal amount set forth above.  

Any  statements  made  in  this  Official  Statement  involving  matters  of  opinion  or  of 
estimates, whether or not so expressly stated, are set forth as such and not as representations 
of fact, and no representation is made that any of the estimates will be realized.  Definitions of 
certain terms used herein and not defined herein have the meaning set forth in the Indenture or 
the respective Fiscal Agent Agreement described herein.  

 
 

INTRODUCTION 

This Introduction is not a summary of this Official Statement.  It is only a brief description 
of and guide to, and is qualified by, more complete and detailed information contained in the 
entire Official Statement, including the cover page and appendices hereto, and the documents 
summarized or described herein.  A full review should be made of the entire Official Statement.  
The  offering  of  the  Bonds  to  potential  investors  is  made  only  by  means  of  the  entire  Official 
Statement. 

 
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Official Statement have the meanings set 
forth in the Indenture (as defined below).  See “APPENDIX A – Summary of Certain Provisions 
of Principal Legal Documents.” 

 
Purposes of the Bonds.  The Bonds are being issued by the Authority to assist the City 
 
of  Elk  Grove,  California  (the  "City")  in  the  financing  and  refinancing  of  costs  of  certain 
improvements of benefit to property within the City’s East Franklin Community Facilities District 
No.  2002-1  (the  “East  Franklin  CFD”)  and  Community  Facilities  District  No.  2003-1  (Poppy 
Ridge)  (the  “Poppy  Ridge  CFD”)  (collectively  herein,  the  "Districts").    See  "FINANCING 
PLAN.” 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Financing  Plan.  The  City  has  previously  issued  (i)  for  the  East  Franklin  CFD,  the 
 
Special  Tax  Refunding  Bonds,  Series  2005,  (ii)  for  the  Poppy  Ridge  CFD,  the  Special  Tax 
Refunding  Bonds,  Series  2005,  and  (iii)  for  the  Poppy  Ridge  CFD,  the  Special  Tax  Bonds, 
Series 2006 (collectively, the “Prior CFD Bonds”). Each series of the Prior CFD Bonds will be 
refunded by the City concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds through the issuance by the 
City of a series of Special Tax Bonds, Series 2015 for each respective District (collectively, the 
“CFD Bonds”). 
 

 The Prior CFD Bonds were issued to refinance bonds issued in 2002 and 2003 and to 
provide additional money for the construction and acquisition of certain public improvements of 
benefit to original development in each respective District.  The City will refund the CFD Bonds 
concurrently  with  the  issuance  of  the  Bonds,  and  use  a  portion  of  the  proceeds  of  the  CFD 
Bonds to finance certain improvements of benefit to property in the Districts.  
 

The  Prior  East  Franklin  CFD  Bonds  and  the  Prior  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  Bonds  were 
purchased  by  the  Authority  with  proceeds  of  the  $90,875,000  Elk  Grove  Finance  Authority 
Special  Tax  Revenue  Bonds  (the  “2005  Authority  Bonds”);  and  $15,900,000  Elk  Grove 
Finance Authority Special Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2006 (the “2006 Authority Bonds”). The 
outstanding  2005  Authority  Bonds  and  2006  Authority  Bonds  (together,  the  “Prior  Authority 
Bonds”)  will  be  redeemed  and  defeased  in  connection  with  the  refunding  of  the  Prior  East 
Franklin  CFD  Bonds  and  the  Prior  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  Bonds.  Proceeds  of  the  Bonds  will  be 
used  by  the  Authority  to  refund  the  2005  Authority  Bonds  on  a  current  basis  and  the  2006 
Authority Bonds on an advance basis, and to simultaneously refund the Prior CFD Bonds by 
purchasing the newly issued CFD Bonds. See “FINANCING PLAN.”  

 
Authority for Issuance.  The Bonds are issued pursuant to the provisions relating to the 
 
joint exercise of powers found in Chapter 5 of Division 7 of Title 1 of the California Government 
Code  and  the  terms  of  an  Indenture  dated  as  of  July  1,  2015  (the  "Indenture")  among  the 
Authority,  the  City  and  U.S.  Bank  National  Association  (the  "Trustee").  The  CFD  Bonds  are 
issued by the City pursuant to a Fiscal Agent Agreement for each respective series of Bonds 
(each,  a “CFD Bonds Fiscal Agent Agreement”)  between  the  City and  U.S.  Bank  National 
Association  (the  "Fiscal  Agent"),  and  the  Mello-Roos  Community  Facilities  Act  of  1982,  as 
amended, being California Government Code Section 53311, et seq. (the “Act”). 
 
Security for the Bonds.  The Bonds are special obligations of the Authority, payable 
 
from  and  secured  by  “Revenues”  (as  defined  herein)  of  the  Authority  consisting  primarily  of 
payments received by the Authority from the City in connection with the CFD Bonds. No series 
of CFD Bonds or the pledge of special taxes to pay such CFD Bonds is cross-collateralized to 
any  other  series.    Scheduled  payments  under  the  CFD  Bonds  collectively  are  sufficient  to 
provide the Authority with money to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due.  
See "SECURITY FOR THE BONDS AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT THEREFOR - Payment of 
the CFD Bonds” below. 
 

The Bonds are secured by a lien on and security interest in all of the Revenues and any 
other amounts (including proceeds of the sale of the Bonds) held in certain funds established 
under  to  the  Indenture.  See  "SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS  AND  SOURCES  OF  PAYMENT 
THEREFOR - Revenues."   
 

The  CFD  Bonds  are  issued  upon  and  are  secured  by  special  taxes  (net  of  certain 
administrative  expenses)  levied  to  pay  for  facilities  (the  “Special  Tax”  or  “Special  Taxes”) 
levied  against  taxable  property  in  each  respective  Community  Facilities  District,  and  such 

2 

 

unpaid special taxes constitute a trust fund for the redemption and payment of the principal of 
the respective CFD Bonds and the interest thereon.   

 
The  Special  Taxes  are  to  be  levied  by  the  City  on  taxable  real  property  within  the 
boundaries  of  each  District.  The  CFD  Bonds  are  also  payable  from  the  proceeds  of  any 
foreclosure actions brought following a delinquency in payment of the Special Taxes, and from 
amounts held in certain funds and accounts related to the CFD Bonds, including a respective 
separate  reserve  account  for  each  series  of  CFD  Bonds,  all  as  more  fully  described  herein 
(which will each initially be funded by a surety policy, as described below).  The Special Tax 
applicable to each taxable parcel in the District will be levied and collected according to the tax 
liability  determined  by  the  City  Council  through  the  application  of  a  rate  and  method  of 
apportionment  of  Special  Tax  for  each  respective  District  (each,  a  “Special  Tax  Formula”) 
which was approved by the City in connection with the original formation of the Districts.  The 
Special Taxes represent liens on the parcels of land subject to a Special Tax and failure to pay 
the  Special  Taxes  could  result  in  proceedings  to  foreclose  the  delinquent  property.  See 
“SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS  AND  SOURCES  OF  PAYMENT  THEREFOR — Special  Tax 
Methodology”  and  “APPENDIX C-1  AND  APPENDIX  C-2 — RATE  AND  METHOD  OF 
APPORTIONMENT OF SPECIAL TAX.”  

 
Unpaid  special  taxes  do  not  constitute  a  personal  indebtedness  of  the  owners  of  the 
parcels within the Districts and the owners have made no commitment to pay the principal of or 
interest on the CFD Bonds or the Bonds or to support payment of the Bonds in any manner.  In 
the  event  of  delinquency,  proceedings  may  be  conducted  only  against  the  particular  parcel 
securing the delinquent special tax.   
 

No series of CFD Bonds or the pledge of special taxes to pay such CFD Bonds is cross-

collateralized to any other series.  

 
As further security for each respective series of the CFD Bonds, the City will provide a 
reserve surety (each a “Reserve Policy”), issued by BAM, to be held in a separate debt service 
reserve account established for each series under the respective CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement, 
and  used  if  there  are  insufficient  special  tax  revenues  available  to  pay  debt  service  on  the 
respective CFD Bonds when due.  There is no cross-collateralization of the reserve accounts; 
the East Franklin CFD reserve account is only available to pay debt service on the East Franklin 
CFD Bonds and the Poppy Ridge CFD reserve account is only available to pay debt service on 
the  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  Bonds.  See  “SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS  AND  SOURCES  OF 
PAYMENT THEREFOR – Reserve Accounts.”     

 
Additional  CFD  Bonds  and  additional  Bonds  to  purchase  them  may  be  issued  and 
secured on parity with the respective CFD Bonds and Bonds, provided certain conditions are 
met.    See  "SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS  AND  SOURCES  OF  PAYMENT  THEREFOR  – 
Additional CFD Bonds and Bonds.” 

 
Bond Insurance Policy.  Concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds, BAM will issue 
its Bond Insurance Policy.  The Bond Insurance Policy guarantees the scheduled payment of 
principal of and interest on the Bonds maturing on September 1 in the years 2030 through 2036, 
inclusive, and September 1, 2038 (the “Insured Bonds”), when due as set forth in the form of 
the Bond Insurance Policy included as Appendix G to this Official Statement.  
 

The Bond Insurance Policy is not covered by  any insurance security or guaranty fund 

established under New York, California, Connecticut or Florida insurance law.

BAM as issuer of the Bond Insurance Policy and the Reserve Policies, together with its 

successors and assigns, is referred to in this Official Statement as, the “Insurer.”

financed  by  the  CFD  Bonds  for  each  District  and  significant  single  family  residential  home

sold to homeowners.   See "THE DISTRICTS."

to  such 

Property in the Districts is security for the respective Special Taxes. In connection with 
valuing property in the District, the City has obtained the 2014-15 County assessed valuation 
(the "Assessed Valuation") of the property in the District. The aggregate Assessed Valuation 
of taxable property in the Districts is approximately $3.01 billion, which is approximately 33.21 
times  the  $90,630,000  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Bonds  (not  including  overlapping 
debt).  The  aggregate  Assessed  Valuation  of  taxable  property  in  the  East  Franklin  CFD  is 
approximately  $1.68  billion,  which  is  approximately  34.2  times  the  $49,120,000  aggregate 
principal  amount  of  the  East  Franklin  CFD  Bonds  (not  including  overlapping  debt).    The 
aggregate  Assessed  Valuation  of  taxable  property  in  the  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  is  approximately 
$1.33 billion, which is approximately 32.14 times the $41,510,000 aggregate principal amount of 
the  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  Bonds  (not  including  overlapping  debt).      See  “OWNERSHIP  AND 
VALUE OF PROPERTY WITHIN THE DISTRICTS.” 
 

Risks  of  Investment.    See  the  section  of  this  Official  Statement  entitled  “RISK 
FACTORS” for a discussion of special factors that should be considered, in addition to the other 
matters set forth herein, in considering the investment quality of the Bonds. The general fund 
of  the  City  is  not  liable  and  the  full  faith  and  credit  of  the  City  is  not  pledged  for  the 
payment of the interest on, or principal of or redemption premiums, if any, on the CFD 
Bonds  or  the  Bonds.    The  CFD  Bonds  and  the  Bonds  are  not  secured  by  a  legal  or 
equitable pledge of or charge, lien or encumbrance upon any property of the City or any 
of its income or receipts, except the money in the Special Tax Fund (described herein) 
established under the respective Fiscal Agent Agreement, and neither the payment of the 
interest  on  nor  principal  of  or  redemption  premiums,  if  any,  on  the  CFD  Bonds  or  the 
Bonds is a general debt, liability or obligation of the City or the Authority.

descriptions  of  the  Authority,  the  Bonds,  the  Indenture,  the  City,  the  CFD  Bonds,  the  CFD

FINANCING PLAN 

The Bonds are being issued for the following purposes: (i) to acquire the East Franklin 
CFD bonds, which will be issued by the City concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds, and 
(ii) to acquire the Poppy Ridge CFD bonds, which will be issued by the City concurrently with 
the issuance of the Bonds.  Proceeds of the Bonds and the CFD Bonds will be used primarily to 
refund the Prior CFD Bonds and Prior Authority Bonds and to finance certain additional public 
improvements of benefit to the Districts.  Proceeds will also be used to pay the premium for the 
Bond Insurance Policy and Reserve Policy for each series of CFD Bonds and to pay costs of 
issuance, as described below.  

Refunding of Prior Bonds 
 

Refunding of Prior CFD Bonds.  The Bonds are being issued primarily to refund the 
Prior CFD Bonds, which are: (i) for the East Franklin CFD, the Special Tax Refunding Bonds 
Series  2005  issued  in  the  original  principal  amount  of  $57,960,000,  which  refunded  bonds 
issued in 2002 in the original principal amount of $45,000,000 and bonds issued in 2003 in the 
original principal amount of $7,460,000 and financed projects with respect to the East Franklin 
CFD, (ii) for the Poppy Ridge CFD, the Special Tax Bonds Series 2005 issued in the original 
principal amount of $32,915,000, which refunded bonds issued in 2003 in the original principal 
amount of $29,570,000 and financed projects with respect to the Poppy Ridge CFD, and (iii) for 
the  Poppy  Ridge  CFD,  the  Special  Tax  Bonds  Series  2006  issued  in  the  original  principal 
amount of $15,900,000, which financed improvements for the benefit of the Poppy Ridge CFD.  
The Prior CFD Bonds were issued to finance and refinance the construction and acquisition of 
certain public improvements within each respective District necessary for new home and other 
development to occur in such District.  A portion of the proceeds of the CFD Bonds for each 
District  will  also  be  used  to  finance  the  construction  and  acquisition  of  additional  public 
improvements.  

 
Refunding of Prior Authority Bonds. The Prior East Franklin CFD Bonds and the Prior 
Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds serve as security for the Prior Authority Bonds.  The defeasance and 
refunding  of  the  Prior  East  Franklin  CFD  Bonds  and  Prior  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  Bonds,  as 
described above, will cause (i) the outstanding 2005 Authority Bonds to be redeemed in full, on 
a current basis, on September 1,  2015, at a redemption price equal to 100% of  the principal 
amount thereof, together with accrued interest to the redemption date, without premium, and (ii) 
the  outstanding  2006  Authority  Bonds  to  be  redeemed  in  full,  on  an  advance  basis,  on 
September  1,  2016,  at  a  redemption  price  equal  to  100%  of  the  principal  amount  thereof, 
together with accrued interest to the redemption date, without premium.

Refunding Escrow. As to each series of Prior CFD Bonds, a portion of the proceeds of 
the  respective  CFD  Bonds  will  be  transferred  to  U.S.  Bank  National  Association,  acting  as 
escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”) under an Escrow Agreement dated as of July 1, 2015 (the 
“Escrow Agreement”), among the City, the Authority and the Escrow Agent.  

 
The  amounts  deposited  from  the  proceeds  of  the  CFD  Bonds  for  the  purpose  of 
redeeming  the  Prior  Authority  Bonds  will  be  held  by  the  Escrow  Agent  under  the  Escrow 
Agreement  and,  as  to  the  moneys  needed  to  redeem  the  2006  Authority  Bonds,  invested  in 
federal  securities,  and,  as  to  the  moneys  needed  to  redeem  the  2005  Authority  Bonds,  held 
uninvested.  These  funds,  together  with  any  remaining  amounts  held  in  cash  by  the  Escrow 
Agent,  will  be  sufficient  to  pay  and  redeem  the  Prior  CFD  Bonds  in  full  on  their  respective 
redemption dates, as described below, and to defease the outstanding Prior CFD Bonds as of 
the  date  of  issuance  of  the  CFD  Bonds.    See  “VERIFICATION  OF  MATHEMATICAL 
COMPUTATIONS.” 

 
Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, on the redemption dates of the Prior East Franklin 
CFD  Bonds  and  the  Prior  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  Bonds,  corresponding  amounts  of  the  Prior 
Authority Bonds will be redeemed.  Amounts held by the Escrow Agent will be sufficient to pay 
and redeem the 2005 Authority Bonds and the 2006 Authority Bonds in full on their respective 
redemption  dates,  and  to  defease  the  outstanding  Prior  Authority  Bonds  as  of  the  date  of 
issuance of the Bonds.  See “VERIFICATION OF MATHEMATICAL COMPUTATIONS.”  

  
The moneys held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement are pledged to the 
payment of the Prior East Franklin CFD Bonds, the Prior Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds and the Prior 
Authority Bonds and will not be available for the payment of the Bonds, the East Franklin CFD 
Bonds or the Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds.

THE BONDS 

 

This section provides summaries of the Bonds and certain provisions of the Indenture.  
See “APPENDIX A – Summary of Certain Provisions of Principal Legal Documents” for a more 
complete summary of the Indenture.  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this section have 
the meanings given in APPENDIX A.   

 

Authority for Issuance 
 

 

 

Bond Terms 
 

The Bonds are being issued under the Act, the Authority Resolution (which was adopted 
by  the  board  of  directors  of  the  Authority  on  June  24,  2015)  and  the  Indenture.    Under  the 
Authority  Resolution,  the  Bonds  may  be  issued  in  a  principal  amount  not  to  exceed 
$110,000,000.   

General.    The  Bonds  will  be  dated  their  date  of  delivery,  and  will  be  issued  in  the 
aggregate  principal  amounts  set  forth  on  the  inside  cover  page  hereof.    The  Bonds  will  bear 
interest from their dated date at the rates per annum set forth on the inside cover page hereof, 
payable semiannually on each March 1 and September 1, commencing March 1, 2016 (each, 
an “Interest Payment Date”), and will mature in the amounts and on the dates set forth on the 
inside cover page hereof.   

 
The Bonds will be issued in fully registered form in denominations of $5,000 each or any 

integral multiple thereof. 

 
Payment of Interest and Principal.  Interest calculated on the basis of a 360-day year 
of twelve 30-day months on the Bonds will be payable on each Interest Payment Date to the 
person  whose  name  appears  on  the  Bond  Register  as  the  Owner  of  such  Bond  as  of  the 
fifteenth calendar day of the month preceding the month in which such Interest Payment Date 
occurs, whether or not such day is a Business Day (the “Record Date”) immediately preceding 
each such Interest Payment Date, such interest to be paid by check of the Trustee mailed on 
such Interest Payment Date by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the Owner at the address of 
such Owner as it appears on the Bond Register or by wire transfer to an account in the United 
States  of  America  made  on  such  Interest  Payment  Date  upon  instructions  of  any  Owner  of 
$1,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Bonds of a Series provided to the Trustee 
in writing at least 5 Business Days before the Record Date for such Interest Payment Date. 

 
Principal  of  and  premium  (if  any)  on  any  Bond  will  be  paid  upon  presentation  and 
surrender of such Bond, at maturity or the prior redemption of such Bond, at the Trust Office of 
the Trustee. 

 
Calculation of Interest.  Each Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date 
next preceding the date of authentication thereof, unless (a) it is authenticated after a Record 
Date and on or before the following Interest Payment Date, in which event it will bear interest 
from such Interest Payment Date; or (b) it is authenticated on or before February 15, 2016, in 
which event it will bear interest from the Closing Date; provided, however, that if, as of the date 
of authentication of any Bond, interest on such Bond is in default, such Bond will bear interest 
from the Interest Payment Date to which interest has previously been paid or made available for 
payment on such Bond, or from the Closing Date if no interest has been paid or made available 
for payment.

Redemption 
 

 

 

Optional Redemption.  The Bonds maturing on or before September 1, 2025, are not 
subject to optional redemption prior to maturity. The Bonds maturing on and after September 1, 
2026, may be redeemed at the option of the Authority, from any source of available funds, prior 
to maturity on any date on or after September 1, 2025, as a whole, or in part from maturities 
corresponding proportionately to the maturities of the CFD Bonds simultaneously redeemed, if 
any  redemption  of  CFD  Bonds  is  being  accomplished  in  conjunction  with  such  optional 
redemption,  and  otherwise  from  such  maturities  as  are  selected  by  the  Authority,  and  by  lot 
within a maturity, at a redemption price equal to principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed, 
plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption, without premium. 

Special  Mandatory  Redemption.  The  Bonds  are  subject  to  mandatory  special 
redemption  on  any  Interest  Payment  Date  from  proceeds  of  early  redemption  of  CFD  Bonds 
from  prepayment  of  Special  Taxes,  in  whole  or  in  part,  from  maturities  corresponding 
proportionately to the maturities of the CFD Bonds simultaneously redeemed, at the principal 
amount thereof, plus a premium expressed below as a percentage of the principal amount so 
redeemed, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption thereof:

Mandatory  Sinking  Fund  Redemption  of  Bonds.  The  Bonds  maturing  on 
September 1, 2038, are subject to redemption prior to their stated maturity, in part, by lot from 
amounts  deposited  into  the  Principal  Account  in  the  following  amounts  and  on  the  following 
dates, at the principal amount thereof on the date fixed for redemption, without premium, but 
which amounts will be proportionately reduced by the principal amount of all Bonds optionally 
redeemed:

For a description of the redemption provisions of the CFD Bonds, see ”APPENDIX A – 

Summary of Certain Provisions of Principal Legal Documents.”  

 
Notice of Redemption. The Trustee on behalf, and at the expense, of the Authority will 
mail (by first class mail, postage prepaid) notice of any redemption to the respective Owners of 
any  Bonds  designated  for  redemption  at  their  respective  addresses  appearing  on  the  Bond 
Register, and to the Securities Depositories and to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, 
at  least  thirty  (30)  but  not  more  than  sixty  (60)  days  prior  to  the  date  fixed  for  redemption.  
Neither failure to receive any such notice so mailed nor any defect therein will affect the validity 
of the proceedings for the redemption of such Bonds or the cessation of the accrual of interest 
thereon.  Such notice will state the date of the notice, the redemption date, the redemption place 
and the redemption price and will designate the CUSIP numbers, the Bond numbers and the 
maturity  or  maturities  (in  the  event  of  redemption  of  all  of  the  Bonds  of  such  maturity  or 

9 

 

maturities  in  whole)  of  the  Bonds  to  be  redeemed,  and  will  require  that  such  Bonds  be  then 
surrendered  at  the  Trust  Office  of  the  Trustee  for  redemption  at  the  redemption  price,  giving 
notice also that further interest on such Bonds will not accrue after the redemption date.   

 
In addition to the foregoing notice, further notice will be given by the Trustee in said form 
by first class mail to any Bondowner whose Bond has been called for redemption but who has 
failed to submit his Bond for payment by the date which is sixty days after the redemption date, 
but no defect in said further notice nor any failure to give or receive all or any portion of such 
further notice will in any manner defeat the effectiveness of a call for redemption. 

 
Rescission  of  Redemption  Notice.    Any  such  redemption  notice  may  specify  that 
redemption on the specified date will be subject to receipt by the Authority of moneys sufficient 
to cause such redemption (and will specify the proposed source of such moneys), and neither 
the Authority nor the Trustee will have any liability to the Owners or any other party as a result 
of its failure to redeem the Bonds as a result of insufficient moneys. The Authority will have the 
right to rescind any redemption by written notice to the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for 
redemption.  Any notice of redemption will be cancelled and annulled if for any reason funds are 
not available on the date fixed for redemption for the payment in full of the Bonds then called for 
redemption,  and  such  cancellation  will  not  constitute  an  Event  of  Default  hereunder.  The 
Trustee will mail notice of rescission of redemption in the same manner notice of redemption 
was originally provided. 

 
Selection of Bonds of a Maturity for Redemption. Unless otherwise provided under 
the Indenture, whenever provision is made in the Indenture or in the applicable Supplemental 
Indenture for the redemption of fewer than all of the Bonds of a maturity, the Trustee will select 
the Bonds to be redeemed from all Bonds of such maturity not previously called for redemption, 
by lot in any manner which the Trustee in its sole discretion will deem appropriate and fair.  For 
purposes  of  such  selection,  all  Bonds  will  be  deemed  to  be  comprised  of  separate  $5,000 
authorized  denominations,  and  such  separate  authorized  denominations  will  be  treated  as 
separate Bonds which may be separately redeemed. 

 
Partial  Redemption  of  Bonds.  In  the  event  only  a  portion  of  any  Bond  is  called  for 
redemption, then upon surrender of such Bond the Authority will execute and the Trustee will 
authenticate and deliver to the Owner thereof, at the expense of the Authority, a new Bond or 
Bonds of the same maturity date, of authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount 
equal to the unredeemed portion of the Bond to be redeemed. 

 
Effect of Redemption. From and after the date fixed for redemption, if funds available 
for the payment of the principal of and interest (and premium, if any) on the Bonds so called for 
redemption will have been duly provided, such Bonds so called will cease to be entitled to any 
benefit under the Indenture other than the right to receive payment of the redemption price, and 
no  interest  will  accrue  on  such  Bonds  from  and  after  the  redemption  date  specified  in  such 
notice. 

 
Certification of Independent Financial Consultant.  In connection with an optional or 
special mandatory redemption of Bonds, the Authority will deliver to the Trustee a certificate of 
an  Independent  Accountant  verifying  that,  following  such  optional  prepayment  of  the  CFD 
Bonds  and redemption  of  the  Bonds,  the  principal  and interest  generated  from  the  remaining 
CFD Bonds is adequate to make the timely payment of principal and interest due on the Bonds 
that will remain Outstanding hereunder following such optional redemption. 
 

10 

 

Book-Entry Only System 
 

General. The Bonds will be issued as fully registered bonds, registered in the name of 
Cede & Co. as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”), and 
will  be  available  to  actual  purchasers  of  the  Bonds  (the  “Beneficial  Owners”)  in  the 
denominations set forth above, under the book-entry system maintained by DTC, only through 
brokers  and  dealers  who  are  or  act  through  DTC  Participants  (as  defined  in  this  Official 
Statement)  as  described  in  this  Official  Statement.  Beneficial  Owners  will  not  be  entitled  to 
receive  physical  delivery  of  the  Bonds.  See  “APPENDIX  F  —  DTC  and  the  Book-Entry-Only 
System.”  

 
If the book-entry-only system is no longer used with respect to the Bonds, the Bonds will 
be  registered  and  transferred  in  accordance  with  the  Indenture.  See  “–Registration,  Transfer 
and Exchange of Bonds” below.  

 
Payments Made to DTC.  While the Bonds are subject to the book-entry system, the 
principal and interest with respect to a Bond will be paid by the Trustee to DTC, which in turn is 
obligated  to  remit  such  payment  to  its  DTC  Participants  for  subsequent  disbursement  to 
Beneficial  Owners  of  the  Bonds,  as  described  in  “APPENDIX  F  —  DTC  and  the  Book-Entry-
Only System.”  

 

Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Bonds 

 
Bond Register. The Trustee will keep or cause to be kept at its Trust Office sufficient 
records for the registration and transfer of the Bonds, which will be the Bond Register and will at 
all times during regular business hours be open to inspection by the Authority upon reasonable 
notice;  and,  upon  presentation  for  such  purpose,  the  Trustee  will,  under  such  reasonable 
regulations as it may prescribe, register or transfer or cause to be registered or transferred, on 
said records, Bonds as provided under the Indenture. 

 
Transfer of Bonds. Subject to the book-entry only provisions of the Indenture, any Bond 
may  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  be  transferred,  upon  the  Bond  Register,  by  the  person  in 
whose  name  it  is  registered,  in  person  or  by  his  duly  authorized  attorney,  upon  surrender  of 
such Bond for cancellation, accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer in a form 
approved by the Trustee, duly executed. 

 
Whenever  any  Bond  is  surrendered  for  transfer,  the  Authority  will  execute  and  the 
Trustee will thereupon authenticate and deliver to the transferee a new Bond or Bonds of like 
Series, tenor, maturity and aggregate principal amount.  No Bonds selected for redemption will 
be subject to transfer, nor will any Bond be subject to transfer during the 15 days prior to the 
selection of Bonds for redemption. 

 
The cost of printing any Bonds and any services rendered or any expenses incurred by 
the Trustee in connection with any transfer or exchange will be paid by the Authority.  However, 
the Owners of the Bonds will be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge required 
to  be  paid  for  any  exchange  or  registration  of  transfer  and  the  Owners  of  the  Bonds  will  be 
required to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee and Authority in connection 
with the replacement of any mutilated, lost or stolen Bonds. 

 
Exchange of Bonds. Bonds may be exchanged at the Trust Office of the Trustee for 
Bonds  of  the  same  Series,  tenor  and  maturity  and  of  other  authorized  denominations.    No 

11 

Bonds  selected  for  redemption  will  be  subject  to  exchange,  nor  will  any  Bond  be  subject  to 
exchange during the 15 days prior to the selection of Bonds for redemption. The Owners of the 
Bonds will be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge required to be paid for any 
exchange  and  the  Owners  of  the  Bonds  will  be  required  to  pay  the  reasonable  fees  and 
expenses of the Trustee and Authority in connection with the exchange of any Bonds.

Debt Service Schedules 
 

The  Bonds.    The  table  below  presents  the  debt  service  schedule  for  the  Bonds, 
assuming  no  special  redemptions  are  made.  The  scheduled  aggregate  debt  service  on  the 
Bonds  is  approximately  equal  to  the  aggregate  of  the  scheduled  debt  service  on  the  East 
Franklin CFD Bonds and the Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds.

The  CFD  Bonds.    The  following  table  summarizes  the  debt  service  payments  to  be 
received by the Authority as the result of its ownership of the East Franklin CFD Bonds and the 
Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds.   

 
The  CFD  Bonds  mature  on  different  dates,  and  have  different  debt  service  profiles.  
Consequently, the source of security for debt service on the Bonds, and the concentration of the 
revenues derived from the different Districts, will change over time as the Bonds mature.

SECURITY FOR THE BONDS AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT THEREFOR 

 
The  Bonds  are  special  obligations  of  the  Authority,  payable  from  and  secured  by 
Revenues (as defined herein) of the Authority consisting primarily of payments received by the 
Authority  from  the  City  on  the  CFD  Bonds.  Scheduled  payments  under  the  CFD  Bonds 
collectively are sufficient to provide the Authority with money to pay the principal of and interest 
on  the  Bonds  when  due.  This  section  provides  summaries  of  the  security  for  the  Bonds  and 
certain  provisions  of  the  Indenture.    See  “APPENDIX  A  –  Summary  of  Certain  Provisions  of 
Principal Legal Documents” for a more complete summary of the Indenture.  Capitalized terms 
used but not defined in this section have the meanings given in APPENDIX A. 

 

Limited Obligation 
 
 
In order to secure the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 
Bonds in accordance with their terms and the provisions of the Indenture, and subject only to 
the provisions of the Indenture permitting the application thereof for the purposes and on the 
terms and conditions set forth therein, the Authority pledges all of the Revenues and any other 
amounts  (including  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  Bonds)  held  in  any  fund  or  account  established 
pursuant  to  the  Indenture,  other  than  amounts  on  deposit  in  the  Rebate  Fund.    This  pledge 
constitutes a first pledge of and charge and lien upon such assets for the payment of the Bonds 
in  accordance  with  their  terms  and  will  be  valid  and  binding  from  and  after  issuance  of  the 
Bonds, without any physical delivery thereof or further act.  The pledge is also irrevocable until 
all of the bonds issued under the Indenture are no longer Outstanding. 
 
 
Under the Indenture, the Authority unconditionally transfers, assigns, and sets over to the 
Trustee  for  the  benefit  of  the  Owners,  without  recourse,  all  of  the  right,  title  and  interest  of  the 
Authority in the CFD Bonds.  Each series of CFD Bonds are a limited obligation of the City and 
secured by an irrevocable pledge of certain revenues of the City, consisting primarily of monies 
received by the City as payment of special taxes levied against property within each respective 
CFD which secures such CFD Bonds.  Scheduled payments under the CFD Bonds are sufficient 
to provide the Authority with money to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 
Bonds when due.  
 

No CFD Bonds issued under one CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement or the pledge of special 
taxes to pay such CFD Bonds is cross-collateralized to the CFD Bonds issued under the other 
CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement.  
 
 
All obligations of the Authority under the Indenture and the Bonds are special obligations 
of the Authority, payable solely from and secured by Revenues and the amounts in the funds 
established by the Indenture (except amounts in the Rebate Fund).  All obligations of the City 
under each CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement are not general obligations of the City, but are limited 
obligations, payable solely from the special taxes and the  funds pledged therefor  under such 
CFD  Fiscal  Agent  Agreement.    Neither  the  faith  and  credit  of  the  City  nor  of  the  State  of 
California or any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the CFD Bonds. 
 
 
The CFD Bonds are payable solely from and secured solely by the special taxes, net of 
administrative expenses, and the amounts in the Special Tax Fund created with respect to such 
CFD Bonds (the "Special Tax Fund") under the CFD Fiscal Agent Agreements.  The City is not 
obligated to advance available surplus funds from the City treasury to cure any deficiency in any 
Special Tax Fund, provided, however, the City is not prevented, in its sole discretion, from so 

15 

 

advancing funds.  Moneys in each respective CFD Special Tax Fund are available only for use 
with respect to the series of CFD Bonds to which such Special Tax Fund relates.   
 
Revenues 
 
 
The  Bonds  are  secured  by  a  lien  on  and  pledge  of  Revenues  made  in  the  Indenture, 
which consist primarily of amounts received by the Authority as the result of its ownership of the 
CFD Bonds. 

 
The Indenture defines “Revenues” as follows: 
 

(a)  all amounts received from the CFD Bonds;  
 
(b)  any  proceeds  of  the  Bonds  originally  deposited  with  the  Trustee  and  all 
moneys deposited and held from time to time by the Trustee in the funds and accounts 
established under the Indenture with respect to the Bonds (other than the Rebate Fund 
and the Surplus Fund); and  

 
(c)  investment  income  with  respect  to  any  moneys  held  by  the  Trustee  in  the 
funds  and  accounts  established  under  the  Indenture  with  respect  to  the  Bonds  (other 
than investment income on moneys held in the Rebate Fund and the Surplus Fund). 
 

Revenues; Flow of Funds 
 

Revenues. The Bonds are secured by a first lien on and pledge of all of the Revenues. 
Under  the  Indenture,  all  of  the  Revenues  and  the  amounts  in  the  funds  established  by  the 
Indenture are pledged by the Authority first to secure the payment of the principal of and interest 
on  the  Bonds,  all  in  accordance  with  their  terms  and  the  provisions  of  the  Indenture.    Said 
pledge  constitutes  a  lien  on  and  security  interest  in  the  Revenues  upon  the  physical  delivery 
thereof.    In  the  Indenture,  the  Authority  transfers  in  trust  and  assigns  to  the  Trustee,  for  the 
benefit of the Owners from time to time of the Bonds, all of the Revenues and all of the right, 
title and interest of the Authority in the CFD Bonds.  The Trustee shall be entitled to and shall 
collect  and  receive  all  of  the  Revenues,  and  any  Revenues  collected  or  received  by  the 
Authority as the agent of the Trustee shall be deemed to be held, and to have been collected or 
received, by the Authority and shall be paid by the Authority to the Trustee.  The Trustee also is 
entitled  to  and  may  take  all  steps,  actions  and  proceedings  reasonably  necessary  in  its 
judgment  to  enforce,  either  jointly  with  the  Authority  or  separately,  all  of  the  rights  of  the 
Authority and all of the obligations of the City under the CFD Bonds. 

 
Collection by the Trustee.  The Trustee will collect and receive all of the Revenues, 
and any Revenues collected or received by the Authority will be deemed to be held, and to have 
been collected or received, by the Authority as the agent of the Trustee and will forthwith be 
paid by the Authority to the Trustee.  Under the Indenture, the Trustee is directed to establish, 
maintain  and  hold  in  trust  a  special  fund  designated  as  the  "Revenue  Fund"  and  deposit  the 
Revenues,  when  and  as  received  by  the  Trustee,  therein;  provided  that  the  Trustee  shall 
deposit any Revenues that represent payment of the redemption price of any CFD Bonds into 
the Redemption Fund.  All moneys at any time held in the Revenue Fund shall be held in trust 
for the benefit of the Owners and shall be disbursed, allocated, and applied solely for payment 
of  the  Bonds  and  for  any  other  uses  and  purposes  set  forth  in  the  Indenture.  Subject  to  the 
provisions of the Indenture regarding the remedies and rights of the Bond Owners, the Trustee 
is also entitled to and will take all steps, actions and proceedings reasonably necessary in its 

16 

 

judgment  to  enforce,  either  jointly  with  the  Authority  or  separately,  all  of  the  rights  of  the 
Authority and all of the obligations of the City under the CFD Bonds. 

 
Application of Revenues. On each Interest Payment Date and date for redemption of 
the  Bonds,  the  Trustee  will  transfer  from  the  Revenue  Fund,  and  deposit  into  the  following 
respective accounts for the Bonds, the following amounts in the following order of priority, the 
requirements  of  each  such  account  (including  the  making  up  of  any  deficiencies  in  any  such 
account resulting from lack of Revenues sufficient to make any earlier required deposit) at the 
time of deposit to be satisfied before any transfer is made to any account subsequent in priority: 

 
Interest Account.  On each Interest Payment Date and redemption date, the Trustee will 
deposit in the Interest Account an amount required to cause the aggregate amount on deposit in 
the Interest Account to equal the amount of interest becoming due and payable on such Interest 
Payment Date on all Outstanding Bonds or to be paid on the Bonds being redeemed on such 
date. 

 
No  deposit  need  be  made  into  the  Interest  Account  if  the  amount  contained  in  such 
account is at least equal to the interest becoming due and payable upon all Outstanding Bonds 
on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or redemption date, as applicable. 

 
All moneys in the Interest Account will be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for 
the purpose of paying interest on the Bonds as it becomes due and payable (including accrued 
interest on any Bonds redeemed prior to maturity). 

 
If  the  amounts  on  deposit  in  the  Interest  Account  on  any  Interest  Payment  Date  or 
redemption  date  are  insufficient  for  any  reason  to  pay  the  aggregate  amount  of  interest  then 
coming due and payable on the Outstanding Bonds, the Trustee will apply such amounts to the 
payment of interest on each of the Outstanding Bonds on a pro rata basis. 

 
Principal Account.  On each Interest Payment Date and redemption date on which the 
principal  of  the  Bonds  will  be  payable,  the  Trustee  will  deposit  in  the  Principal  Account  an 
amount required to cause the aggregate amount on deposit in the Principal Account to equal the 
principal  amount  of,  and  premium  (if  any)  on,  the  Bonds  coming  due  and  payable  on  such 
Interest Payment Date, or required to be redeemed on such date; provided, however, that no 
amount will be deposited to effect a mandatory special redemption unless the Trustee has first 
received  a  certificate  of  an  Independent  Accountant  certifying  that  such  deposit  to  effect  the 
redemption of the Bonds will not impair the ability of the Authority to make timely payment of the 
principal of and interest on the Bonds, assuming for such purposes that the City continues to 
make timely payments on all CFD Bonds not then in default. 

 
All moneys in the Principal Account will be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for 
the  purpose  of  (i)  paying  the  principal  of  the  Bonds  at  the  maturity  thereof  or  (ii)  paying  the 
principal of any Bonds upon the redemption thereof. 

 
Deficiencies.  If  on  any  Interest  Payment  Date  or  date  for  redemption  the  amount  on 
deposit in the Revenue Fund is inadequate to make the transfers described above as a result of 
a payment default on an issue of CFD Bonds, the Trustee will immediately notify the City of the 
amount needed to make the required deposits under “Application of Revenues” above.  In the 
event  that  within  5  Business  Days  of  delivering  such  notice  the  Trustee  receives  additional 
payments  from  the  City  to  cure  such  shortfall,  the  Trustee  will  deposit  such  amounts  to  the 
account designated in writing by the City. 

17 

 

 

 

 
Deposit into Rebate Fund. On each Interest Payment Date after making the transfers 
described above, upon receipt of a Request of the Authority to do so, the Trustee will transfer 
from the Revenue Fund to the Rebate Fund for deposit in the accounts in the Rebate Fund the 
amounts specified in such Request. 

 
Surplus  Fund.  On  September  1  of  each  year,  after  making  the  deposits  described 
above, the Trustee will transfer all amounts remaining on deposit in the Revenue Fund to the 
Surplus Fund. 

Reserve Account Only for CFD Bonds  
 

The Authority has not established a debt service reserve account for the Bonds, but the 
City has established a debt service reserve account for each of the CFD Bonds. See “Security 
for the CFD Bonds - Reserve Accounts” below.   

Surplus Fund 

 
Any  amounts  transferred  to  the  Surplus  Fund  will  no  longer  be  considered  Revenues 
and are not pledged to repay the Bonds. So long as CFD Bonds are outstanding, on September 
1  of  each  year,  after  setting  aside  any  amount  specified  in  a  Request  of  the  Authority  as 
necessary to pay Administrative Expenses, any moneys remaining in the Surplus Fund will be 
transferred to the City and used for any lawful purpose. 
 
Additional CFD Bonds and Bonds 
 

Additional Authority Bonds. The Authority may by Supplemental Indenture  establish 
one  or  more  additional  Series  of  Bonds  (“Additional  Bonds”)  secured  on  parity  with  the 
Bonds, subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture, which include the condition that such 
Additional Bonds are issued for the purpose of facilitating the issuance of additional bonds for 
the  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  or  the  East  Franklin  CFD  as  Parity  Bonds  under  the  respective  CFD 
Bonds Fiscal Agent Agreement, and that after the issuance of the Additional CFD Bonds, the 
Revenues to be received from all bonds of the Districts will be sufficient in time and amount to 
satisfy the debt service requirements on all Bonds and Additional Bonds until the final maturity 
date of the Bonds.  

 
Authority Conditions for Issuance of Additional Series of Bonds. Before Additional 
Bonds  may  be  issued  and  delivered,  the  Authority  will  file  the  following  documents  with  the 
Trustee (upon which documents the Trustee may conclusively rely in determining whether the 
conditions  precedent  to  the  issuance  of  such  Series  of  Bonds  have  been  satisfied)  (i)  an 
executed copy of the Supplemental Indenture authorizing such Series; (ii) the CFD Bonds to be 
purchased with the proceeds of the Additional Bonds, registered in the name of the Trustee; (iii) 
a Certificate of the Authority stating that no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing 
and, (iv) a Certificate of an Independent Financial Consultant or the underwriter of the proposed 
Additional Bonds to the effect the Revenues to be received from all bonds of the Districts will be 
sufficient  in  time  and  amount  to  satisfy  the  debt  service  requirements  on  all  Bonds  and 
Additional Bonds until the final maturity date of the Bonds; (v) an Opinion of Counsel meeting 
the requirements of the Indenture. 

 
Additional  CFD  Bonds.  Under  each  CFD  Bonds  Fiscal  Agent  Agreement  and  as  to 
each  District,  the  City  may  by  Supplemental  Fiscal  Agent  Agreement  establish  one  or  more 

18 

 

additional series of bonds secured under the Fiscal Agent Agreement, equally and ratably with 
CFD Bonds previously issued.  The City may issue, and the Fiscal Agent may authenticate and 
deliver to the purchasers thereof, bonds of any series so established, in such principal amount 
as shall be determined by the City, but only upon compliance by the City with the provisions of 
the CFD Bonds Fiscal Agent Agreement and any additional requirements set forth in the related 
Supplemental Fiscal Agent Agreement. As a condition to issuing additional CFD Bonds, the City 
must provide a certificate of an Independent Financial Consultant certifying that issuance of the 
parity CFD Bonds will not adversely impact the ability of the Authority to pay debt service on the 
Bonds.  
 
The City is authorized to issue bonds payable from Special Taxes in the Poppy Ridge 
CFD in the aggregate principal amount of not-to-exceed $55,000,000 and utilized the remaining 
bonding capacity as part of the Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds. Poppy Ridge can only issue refunding 
bonds. 
 
The City is authorized to issue bonds payable from Special Taxes in the East Franklin 
CFD in the aggregate principal amount of not-to-exceed $75,000,000.  The par amount of the 
East Franklin CFD Bonds not used for refunding purposes is $11,955,000, leaving a remaining 
bonding capacity of $7,690,000.  

 
Additional bonds may be issued for the Poppy Ridge CFD or the East Franklin CFD for 
the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds or to finance additional authorized improvements.  
Additional  CFD  Bonds  issued  to  finance  additional  authorized  improvements  are  subject  to 
certain conditions, including the following:  

 
(1) 

 
(2) 

 
(3) 

Value-to-Lien Ratio -- Aggregate.  The aggregate fair market value of all 
Taxable  Property  (and  the  then  existing  private  improvements  thereon)  on  the  date  of 
the adoption of the Supplemental Agreement authorizing the issuance of such additional 
parity CFD Bonds (based on either the assessed valuations thereof as contained in the 
most recent equalized assessment roll of Sacramento County or an MAI appraisal), will 
be equal to at least twenty (20) times the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of all 
Bonds  to  be  outstanding  after  the  issuance  of  such  parity  CFD  Bonds,  plus  (ii) the 
aggregate  principal  amount  of  all  outstanding  special  assessment  bonds  that  are 
payable  from  special  assessments  levied  on  the  Taxable  Property,  plus  (iii) the 
proportion of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding bonds issued under the 
Act (other than the CFD Bonds) that are payable from special taxes to be levied on the 
Taxable Property. 

Maximum Annual Debt Service Coverage Ratio.  The amount of Special 
Taxes that may be levied in each Fiscal Year following issuance of the additional Parity 
Bonds by application of the Rate and Method of Apportionment on Developed Property 
will be no less than 110% of the Annual Debt Service for the Bond Year that begins in 
the corresponding Fiscal Year with respect to the CFD Bonds to be Outstanding. 

Reserve Account.  The Reserve Account shall be increased to an amount 
equal to the Reserve Requirement; calculated with respect to the respective CFD Bonds 
and Additional CFD Bonds to be outstanding.  
 
 
The conditions set forth as item (1) and (2) above are not applicable to bonds issued to 

refund outstanding CFD Bonds. 

19 

 

 
See “APPENDIX A – Summary of Certain Provisions of Principal Legal Documents” for 

additional conditions to issuing additional CFD Bonds. 

Security for the CFD Bonds 
 

The provisions of the East Franklin CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement and the Poppy Ridge 
CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement (each a “CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement”) with respect to security 
and sources of payment for the East Franklin CFD Bonds and the Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds are 
substantially  identical,  and  will  be  described  together  in  this  section  except  as  otherwise  set 
forth below.   

 
This  section  contains  only  a  brief  description  of  those  provisions  of  each  CFD  Fiscal 
Agent Agreement, which are further described in APPENDIX A.  Capitalized terms used but not 
defined in this section have the meanings given in APPENDIX A.   

 
The CFD Bonds constitute a limited obligation of the City that is secured by a first lien on 
and  pledge  of,  and  is  payable  solely  from,  Net  Taxes  (defined  below)  collected  in  each 
respective CFD and amounts deposited by the City in each Special Tax Fund. The City’s limited 
obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the CFD Bonds from Net Taxes collected in 
each respective CFD and amounts in each Special Tax Fund is absolute and unconditional.  

 
The  CFD  Bonds  do  not  constitute  a  legal  or  equitable  pledge,  charge,  lien  or 
encumbrance upon the respective CFD’s or City’s property, or upon any of its income, receipts 
or revenues, except the Net Taxes collected in the respective CFD and other amounts in the 
respective Special Tax Fund.  

 
Except for the Net Taxes for each CFD, neither the credit nor the taxing power of 
the City is pledged for the payment of the CFD Bonds or related interest, and no Owner 
of the Bonds may compel the exercise of taxing power by the City or the forfeiture of any 
of its property. The principal of and interest on the CFD Bonds are not a debt of the City, 
the  State  of  California  or  any  of  its  political  subdivisions  within  the  meaning  of  any 
constitutional or statutory limitation or restriction.   

 
Special  Taxes;  Gross  Taxes;  Net  Taxes.    The  “Special  Taxes”  for  each  CFD  are 
levied and collected according to the special tax formula contained in the rate and method of 
apportionment  established  for  that  respective  CFD.    See  “–  Special  Tax  Methodology,” 
APPENDIX C-1 and APPENDIX C-2. 

The “Net Taxes” pledged by the City to the CFD Bonds is defined in each CFD 
Fiscal  Agent  Agreement  as  “Gross  Taxes”  minus  amounts  set  aside  to  pay  the 
"Administrative Expenses Cap" (which, for Fiscal Year 2015-16, is $177,918 for East 
Franklin  CFD  and  $176,000  for  Poppy  Ridge  CFD,  in  each  case  the  Administrative 
Expenses Cap may escalate by 2% each Fiscal Year).   

 
“Gross Taxes” is defined as the proceeds of the Special Taxes received by the 
City,  including  any  scheduled  payments  and  any  prepayments  of,  or  interest  on,  such 
Special Taxes, and proceeds of the redemption or sale of property sold as a result of 
foreclosure of the lien of the Special Taxes to the amount of said lien and interest on 
such amount.  “Gross Taxes” do not include any penalties collected in connection with 

 

 

20 

 

delinquent  Special  Taxes  or  any  interest  in  excess  of  the  interest  due  on  the  CFD 
Bonds.  For Poppy Ridge CFD, Gross Taxes excludes the Public Safety Special Tax. 
 
Allocation of Special Taxes.  Except for the portion of any Prepayment to be deposited 
to  the  Redemption  Account,  the  Fiscal  Agent  will,  on  each  date  on  which  the  Net  Taxes  are 
received from the City, deposit the Net Taxes in each Special Tax Fund to be held in trust for 
the Authority, as sole Owner of the CFD Bonds.  The Fiscal Agent will transfer the Net Taxes on 
deposit in each Special Tax Fund on the dates and in the amounts set forth in each CFD Fiscal 
Agent Agreement, in the following order of priority, to: 

the Interest Account of each Special Tax Fund; 
the Principal Account of each Special Tax Fund; 
the Redemption Account of each Special Tax Fund; 
the Reserve Account of each Special Tax Fund; and 
each Surplus Fund. 

 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 
 
Neither series of CFD Bonds is secured by Special Taxes from the other CFD; the East 
Franklin CFD Special Taxes are available only to pay debt service on the East Franklin CFD 
Bonds and the Poppy Ridge CFD Special Taxes are available only to pay debt service on the 
Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds.   

 
Parity CFD Bonds.  Under each CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement, the City covenants that 
it will not mortgage or  otherwise encumber, pledge or place any charge upon any of the Net 
Taxes  (except  as  provided  in  each  CFD  Fiscal  Agent  Agreement),  and  will  not  issue  any 
obligation or security having a lien or charge upon the Net Taxes superior to or on a parity with 
the  CFD  Bonds,  except  for  parity  bonds  issued  in  accordance  with  the  CFD  Fiscal  Agent 
Agreement.  See “- Additional CFD Bond and Bonds” above. 

 
Nothing in each CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement prevents the City from issuing or incurring 
indebtedness  payable  from  a  pledge  of  Net  Taxes  that  is  subordinate  in  all  respects  to  the 
pledge of Net Taxes to repay the related CFD Bonds.  

 
Priority of Lien.  Each installment of the Special Taxes, and any interest and penalties 
on the Special Taxes, constitutes a lien on the parcel of land on which it was imposed until paid.  
This  lien  is  co-equal  to  and  independent  of  the  lien  for  general  taxes,  the  lien  of  any  other 
community  facilities  district  special  taxes  and  special  assessment  liens.    See  “OWNERSHIP 
AND VALUE OF PROPERTY WITHIN THE DISTRICTS - Direct and Overlapping Governmental 
Obligations.”     

 
Separate CFD Bonds Reserve Accounts.  A separate reserve account (each, a "CFD 
Bonds  Reserve  Account"  and  collectively,  the  "CFD  Bonds  Reserve  Accounts")  for  each 
series of CFD Bonds is established by each CFD Bonds Fiscal Agent Agreement to be held by 
the  Fiscal  Agent  for  the  benefit  of  the  Authority  as  the  Owner  of  the  CFD  Bonds.  Amounts 
available with respect to each CFD Bonds Reserve Account may only be used for the particular 
series of CFD Bonds to which the respective CFD Bonds Reserve Account relates. 

 
The Authority has not established a debt service reserve account for the Bonds. 
 
Upon delivery of the CFD Bonds, the amount on deposit in each CFD Bonds Reserve 
Account will be established by depositing a Reserve Account Credit Instrument (defined below) 
in  the  form  of  a  Reserve  Policy  to  be  issued  by  BAM,  in  the  amount  of  the  "Reserve 

21 

 

Requirement" for the respective CFD Bonds, which is as of any date of calculation, the least of 
(i) Maximum Annual Debt Service as of such date, (ii) 125% of average Annual Debt Service on 
all  respective  CFD  Bonds  Outstanding  as  of  such  date  and  (iii)  10%  of  the  original  principal 
amount  of  the  respective  CFD  Bonds,  or  such  lesser  amount  that,  pursuant  to  the  Internal 
Revenue Code, may be borrowed and invested at an unrestricted yield when all debt service 
reserve  accounts  maintained  with  respect  to  all  CFD  Bonds  issued  in  conjunction  with  the 
Bonds  issued  to  purchase  the  CFD  Bonds  are  taken  into  consideration.    “Maximum  Annual 
Debt Service” means the maximum sum obtained for any Bond Year by adding the following for 
each Bond Year: (1) the principal amount of all such Outstanding CFD Bonds payable in such 
Bond  Year  either  at  maturity  or  pursuant  to  a  Sinking  Fund  Payment;  and  (2)  the  interest 
payable on the aggregate principal amount of all such CFD Bonds Outstanding in such Bond 
Year if the respective CFD Bonds are retired as scheduled. With respect to each series of CFD 
Bonds,  “Annual  Debt  Service”  means  the  principal  amount  of  any  such  Outstanding  CFD 
Bonds payable in a Bond Year either at maturity or pursuant to a Sinking Fund Payment and 
any  interest  payable  on  any  such  Outstanding  CFD  Bonds  in  such  Bond  Year,  if  such  CFD 
Bonds are retired as scheduled. 

 
Amounts available under the Reserve Policy in each CFD Bonds Reserve Account will 
be available for paying the principal of and interest on the respective CFD Bonds when due in 
the event that the moneys in the respective Special Tax Fund are insufficient therefor. 

 
 
The funding of each Reserve Account is being satisfied with the acquisition of a financial 
instrument meeting the requirements of a “Reserve Account Credit Instrument” in the form of a 
Reserve  Policy  to  be  issued  by  BAM.    “Reserve  Account  Credit  Instrument”  is  defined  to 
mean an irrevocable standby or direct-pay letter of credit or surety bond issued by a commercial 
bank or insurance company, provided that all of the following requirements are met:  

 

(a)  the  long-term  credit  rating  of  such  bank  or  insurance  company  from  either 
Moody’s  Ratings  Services  “Aa3”  or  Standard  &  Poor’s  is  “AA”  or  better  at  the  time  of 
issuance or delivery of such Reserve Account Credit Instrument;  

 
(b) such letter of credit or surety bond has a term of at least 12 months;  
 
(c) such letter of credit or surety bond has a stated amount at least equal to the 
portion  of  the  Reserve  Requirement  with  respect  to  which  funds  are  proposed  to  be 
released pursuant to the Fiscal Agent Agreement; and  

 
(d)  the  Fiscal  Agent  is  authorized  under  such  letter  of  credit  or  surety  bond  to 
draw thereunder an amount equal to any deficiencies which may exist from time to time 
in  the  Interest  Account  or  the  Principal  Account  for  the  purpose  of  making  payments 
required under the respective Fiscal Agent Agreement. 

 

THE AUTHORITY AND THE CITY HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REPLENISH THE CFD 
BONDS  RESERVE  ACCOUNTS  EXCEPT  TO  THE  EXTENT  THAT  DELINQUENT  SPECIAL 
TAXES ARE PAID OR PROCEEDS FROM FORECLOSURE SALES ARE REALIZED. 

 
Covenant  to  Commence  Foreclosure  Proceedings.  Under  the  Act,  the  City  will 
covenant in each CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement with and for the benefit of the Authority, as the 
owners of the CFD Bonds, that it will order, and cause to be commenced as described below, 
and thereafter diligently prosecute to judgment (unless such delinquency is theretofore brought

current), an action in the superior court to foreclose the lien of any Special Tax or installment 
thereof not paid when due as provided in the following two paragraphs.  

 
On or about October 1 of each year, the City will compare the amount of Special Taxes 
theretofore levied in each CFD for the past fiscal year to the amount of Gross Taxes theretofore 
received by the City, and:  

(i) 

Individual  Delinquencies.  If  the  City  determines  that  any  single  parcel 
subject to the Special Tax in the CFD is delinquent in the payment of Special Taxes in 
the aggregate amount of $3,000 or more, then the City will send or cause to be sent a 
notice of delinquency (and a demand for immediate payment of the delinquent amounts) 
to  the  property  owner  within  60  days  of  such  determination,  and  (if  the  delinquency 
remains  uncured)  foreclosure  proceedings  will  be  commenced  by  the  City  within  120 
days of such determination. 

Aggregate Delinquencies. If the City determines that the total amount of 
delinquent Special Tax for the prior Fiscal Year for the entire CFD (including the total of 
delinquencies under paragraph (i) above), exceeds 5% of the total Special Tax due and 
payable  for  the  prior  Fiscal  Year,  the  City  will  notify  or  cause  to  be  notified  property 
owners  who  are  then  delinquent  in  the  payment  of  Special  Taxes  (and  demand 
immediate payment of the delinquency) within 60 days of such determination, and will 
commence foreclosure proceedings within 120 days of such determination against each 
parcel of land in the CFD with a Special Tax delinquency.  

 
(ii) 

 

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  City  may  determine  not  to  initiate  foreclosure 
proceedings if (a) the amount in the CFD Bonds Reserve Account for such CFD is equal to the 
Reserve Requirement and (b) there have been no defaults in the payment of debt service on the 
related CFD Bonds. 

 
The  owners  of  the  Bonds  benefit  from  the  CFD  Bonds  Reserve  Account  established 
pursuant to each CFD Bonds Fiscal Agent Agreement; however, if delinquencies in the payment 
of  the  Special  Taxes  with  respect  to  the  CFD  Bonds  are  significant  enough  to  completely 
deplete  the  applicable  CFD  Bonds  Reserve  Account,  there  could  be  a  default  or  a  delay  in 
payments  of  principal  and  interest  to  the  owners  of  the  Bonds  pending  prosecution  of 
foreclosure proceedings and receipt by the City of the proceeds of foreclosure sales.  Provided 
that it is not levying the Special Tax at the annual Maximum Special Tax rates set forth in the 
Special Tax Formula, the City may adjust (but not to exceed the annual Maximum Special Tax) 
the Special Taxes levied on all property within the applicable District subject to the Special Tax 
to  provide  an  amount  required  to  pay  debt  service  on  the  respective  CFD  Bonds  and  to 
replenish the respective CFD Bonds Reserve Account. 

 
Under current law, a judgment debtor (property owner) has at least 140 days from the 
date of service of the notice of levy in which to redeem the property to be sold.  If a judgment 
debtor fails to redeem and the property is sold, his or her only remedy is an action to set aside 
the sale, which must be brought within 90 days of the date of sale.  If, as a result of such an 
action  a  foreclosure  sale  is  set  aside,  the  judgment  is  revived  and  the  judgment  creditor  is 
entitled to interest on the revived judgment as if the sale had not been made (California Code of 
Civil Procedure Section 701.680). 

 
Foreclosure by court action is subject to normal litigation delays, the nature and extent of 
which are largely dependent upon the nature of the defense, if any, put forth by the debtor and 

23 

 

the condition of the calendar of the superior court of the county.  Such foreclosure actions can 
be stayed by the superior court on generally accepted equitable grounds or as the result of the 
debtor’s  filing  for  relief  under  the  Federal  bankruptcy  laws.    The  Act  provides  that,  upon 
foreclosure, the Special Tax lien will have the same lien priority as is provided for ad valorem 
taxes and special assessments. 

 
No assurances can be given that the real property subject to a judicial foreclosure sale 
will be sold or, if sold, that the proceeds of sale will be sufficient to pay any delinquent Special 
Tax installment.  The Act does not require the District to purchase or otherwise acquire any lot 
or parcel of property foreclosed upon if there is no other purchaser at such sale.  

 
Section 53356.6 of the Act requires that property sold pursuant to foreclosure under the 
Act  be  sold  for  not  less  than  the  amount  of  judgment  in  the  foreclosure  action,  plus  post-
judgment  interest  and  authorized  costs,  unless  the  consent  of  the  owners  of  75%  of  the 
outstanding  Bonds  is  obtained.    However,  under  Section  53356.6  of  the  Act,  the  District,  as 
judgment creditor, is entitled to purchase any property sold at foreclosure using a “credit bid,” 
where the District could submit a bid crediting all or part of the amount required to satisfy the 
judgment for the delinquent amount of the Special Tax.  If the District becomes the purchaser 
under a credit bid, the District must pay the amount of its credit bid into the redemption fund 
established for the Bonds, but this payment may be made up to 24 months after the date of the 
foreclosure sale.  

 
Other Covenants of the City. In each CFD Fiscal Agent Agreement, the City will make 

the following covenants (among others).   

 
Punctual Payment.  It will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of 
and interest on each respective series of CFD Bonds, to the extent that Net Taxes and other 
amounts  pledged  under  the  respective  CFD  Fiscal  Agent  Agreement  are  available  for  such 
payment. 

 
Against Encumbrance. It will not mortgage or otherwise encumber, pledge or place any 
charge  upon  any  of  the  Net  Taxes  except  as  provided  in  the  respective  CFD  Fiscal  Agent 
Agreement, and will not issue any obligation or security having a lien or charge upon the Net 
Taxes  superior  to  or  on  a  parity  with  the  CFD  Bonds.    Nothing  in  each  CFD  Fiscal  Agent 
Agreement prevents the City from issuing or incurring indebtedness payable from a pledge of 
Net Taxes that is subordinate in all respects to the pledge of Net Taxes to repay the related 
series of CFD Bonds. 

 
Levy of Special Tax. The City will comply with all requirements of the Mello-Roos Act so 
as to assure the timely collection of Gross Taxes, including without limitation, the enforcement 
of delinquent Special Taxes. 

 
Processing. On or within 5 Business Days of each June 1, the CFD Fiscal Agent 
will provide the City with a notice stating the amount then on deposit in the Special Tax 
Fund and the other funds and accounts held by the Fiscal Agent under the respective 
CFD  Fiscal  Agent  Agreement,  whether  or  not  amounts  need  to  be  deposited  into  the 
Reserve  Account  to  increase  the  amounts  on  deposit  in  such  account  to  the  Reserve 
Requirement, and informing the City that the Special Taxes need to be levied under the 
Ordinance  as  necessary  to  provide  for  the  amount  set  forth  in  clause  (iii)  below.  The 
receipt of or failure to receive such notice by the City will in no way affect the obligations 
of the City under the following two paragraphs and the Fiscal Agent will not be liable for 

24 

 

 

 

failure  to  provide  such  notice  to  the  City.    Upon  receipt  of  such  notice,  the  City  will 
communicate  with  the  Auditor  to  ascertain  the  relevant  parcels  on  which  the  Special 
Taxes are to be levied, taking into account any parcel splits or combinations during the 
preceding and then current year. 

 
Levy.  The  City  will  effect  the  levy  of  the  Special  Taxes  each  Fiscal  Year  in 
accordance with the Ordinance by each August 10 that the CFD Bonds are outstanding, 
or otherwise such that the computation of the levy is complete before the final date on 
which  Auditor  will  accept  the  transmission  of  the  Special  Tax  amounts  for  the  parcels 
within each District for inclusion on the next real property tax roll.  Upon the completion 
of  the  computation  of  the  amounts  of  the  levy,  the  City  will  prepare  or  cause  to  be 
prepared, and will transmit to the Auditor, such data as the Auditor requires to include 
the levy of the Special Taxes on the next real property tax roll.  

 
Computation. The City will fix and levy the amount of Special Taxes within each 
District  in  an  amount  sufficient,  together  with  other  amounts  on  deposit  in  the  related 
Special Tax Fund and available for such purpose, to pay (A) the principal of and interest 
on  the  related  CFD  Bonds  when  due,  (B)  the  Administrative  Expenses,  including 
amounts  necessary  to  discharge  any  rebate  obligation,  during  such  year  and  (C)  any 
amounts required to replenish the related Reserve Account to the Reserve Requirement, 
taking into account the balances in such funds and in the Special Tax Fund. The Special 
Taxes so levied may not exceed the authorized amounts as provided in the proceedings 
under each Resolution of Formation. 

 
Collection.  The  Special  Taxes  will  be  payable  and  be  collected  in  the  same 
manner and at the same time and in the same installment as the general taxes on real 
property are payable, and have the same priority, become delinquent at the same time 
and in the same proportionate amounts and bear the same proportionate penalties and 
interest after delinquency as do the ad valorem taxes on real property. 

 

Maintenance of Special Taxes.  The City will not consent to or conduct proceedings with 
respect to a reduction in the Special Taxes that may be levied in the District below an amount, 
for any Fiscal Year, equal to 110% of the aggregate of the debt service due and payable with 
respect  to  the  Bonds  in  each  corresponding  Bond  Year,  plus  100%  of  the  City’s  reasonable 
estimate of Administrative Expenses for such Bond Year; provided, however, that the City may 
at any time reduce the Special Taxes to the extent that the amount of Special Taxes that would 
result from levying the Special Taxes at such maximum amounts would result in an amount of 
Special Taxes in excess of the amount required to comply with such covenant.  

Special Tax Methodology 

 
The Special Tax authorized under the Act applicable to land within each District will be 
levied and collected according to the tax liability determined by the City through the application 
of the appropriate amount or rate as described in the respective Special Tax Formulas set forth 
in  APPENDIX  C-1  and  APPENDIX  C-2.  The  following  paragraphs  in  this  section  summarize 
certain provisions of the Special Tax Formula for each District. Capitalized terms set forth in this 
section  and  not  otherwise  defined  have  the  meanings  set  forth  in  the  respective  Special  Tax 
Formula.  

25 

 

East Franklin CFD. Each Fiscal Year using the definitions set forth in the Special Tax 
Formula,  all  Taxable  Property  within  the  District  shall  be  classified  as  Developed  Property  or 
Undeveloped Property, and shall be subject to Special Taxes as described below. Developed 
Property shall be further assigned to a Land Use Class as specified in the below. Undeveloped 
Property shall be further assigned to a Land Use Class as specified in the next table.

In some instances an Assessor's Parcel of Developed Property may contain more than 
one Land Use Class. The Maximum Special Tax levied on an Assessor's Parcel shall be the 
sum of the Maximum Special Tax levies that can be imposed on all Land Use Classes located 
on that Assessor's Parcel. The CFD Administrator's allocation to each type of property shall be 
final. 

 
For each Fiscal Year, the City Council shall levy the Special Tax until the amount of the 
Special  Tax  levied  equals  the  Special  Tax  Requirement.  "Special  Tax  Requirement"  means 
that  amount  required  in  any  Fiscal  Year  for  the  CFD  to:  (a)  (i)  pay  debt  service  on  all 
Outstanding Bonds for the calendar year that commences in such Fiscal Year; (ii) pay periodic 
costs on the Bonds, including but not limited to, credit enhancement and rebate payments on 
the  Bonds;  (iii)  pay  reasonable  Administrative  Expenses;  (iv)  pay  any  amounts  required  to 
establish or replenish any Bond Reserve Accounts for all Outstanding Bonds; (v) pay directly for 
acquisition  or  construction  of  authorized  facilities  to  be  constructed  or  acquired  by  the  CFD, 
except Special Taxes on Undeveloped Property shall not be levied for this purpose; (vi) pay for 
reasonably  anticipated  delinquent  Special  Taxes  based  on  the  delinquency  rate  for  Special 
Taxes  levied  in  the  previous  Fiscal  Year;  less  (b)  a  credit  for  funds  available  to  reduce  the 
annual  Special  Tax  levy,  as  determined  by  the  CFD  Administrator  pursuant  to  the  Indenture. 
The Special Tax shall be levied each Fiscal Year as follows: 

First: The Special Tax shall be levied on each Assessor's Parcel of Developed 

Property at 100% of the applicable Maximum Special Tax; 

 
Second: If additional monies are needed to satisfy the Special Tax Requirement 
after the first step has been completed, the Special Tax shall be levied Proportionately 
on  each  Assessor's  Parcel  of  Final  Map  Residential  Property  at  up  to  100%  of  the 
Maximum Special Tax for Final Map Residential Property; 

 

26 

 

Third:  If  additional  monies  are  needed  to  satisfy  the  Special  Tax  Requirement 
after  the  first  two  steps  have  been  completed,  the  Special  Tax  shall  be  levied 
Proportionately on each Assessor's Parcel of Large Lot Property at up to 100% of the 
Maximum Special Tax for Large Lot Property; 

 
Fourth: If additional monies are needed to satisfy the Special Tax Requirement 
after  the  first  three  steps  have  been  completed,  then  the  Special  Tax  shall  be  levied 
Proportionately on each Assessor's Parcel of Tentative Map Property at up to 100% of 
the Maximum Special Tax for Tentative Map Property; and, 

 
Fifth:  If  additional  monies  are  needed  to  satisfy  the  Special  Tax  Requirement 
after  the  first  four  steps  have  been  completed,  then  the  Special  Tax  shall  be  levied 
Proportionately on each Assessor's Parcel of Other Taxable Property at up to 100% of 
the Maximum Special Tax for Other Taxable Property. 
 
Notwithstanding the above the City Council may, in any Fiscal Year, levy Proportionately 
less than 100% of the Maximum Special Tax in step one (above), when (i) the City Council is no 
longer required to levy a Special Tax pursuant to steps two through five above in order to meet 
the Special Tax Requirement; (ii) all authorized CFD Bonds have already been issued or the 
City Council has covenanted that it will not issue any additional CFD Bonds (except refunding 
bonds) to be supported by Special Taxes; and (iii) all authorized facilities have been constructed 
or acquired and paid for from Bonds and/or Special Taxes. 

 
Notwithstanding the above, under no circumstances will the Special Tax levied against 
any  Assessor's  Parcel  of  Residential  Property  for  which  an  occupancy  permit  for  private 
residential  use  has  been  issued  be  increased  by  more  than  ten  percent  annually  up  to  the 
Maximum Special Tax as a consequence of delinquency or default by the owner of any other 
Assessor's Parcel within the District. 

 
The Special Tax may not be levied later than the 2037-38 Fiscal Year. 
 
Poppy Ridge CFD.  Each Fiscal Year using the definitions above, all Taxable Property 
within the CFD shall be classified as Developed Property or Undeveloped Property, and shall be 
subject  to  Facilities  Special  Taxes  (referred  to  as  the  Special  Taxes  throughout  this  Official 
Statement) and to Public Safety Special Taxes as described below.  Only the Facilities Special 
Taxes are pledged to the Bonds.  (The Facilities Special Taxes and the Public Safety Special 
Taxes are referred to as the “Combined Special Tax” under this caption.)  Developed Property 
shall be further assigned to a Land Use Class as specified in the below. Undeveloped Property 
shall be further assigned to a Land Use Class as specified in the next table.

On each July 1 the Maximum Public Safety Special Tax shall be increased by the lesser 
of Local Consumer Price Index (the “CPI”) for the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose Area for All 
Urban  Consumers  or  5%  of  the  amount  in  effect  for  the  previous  Fiscal  Year.  The  CPI  used 
shall  be  as  determined  by  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  from  April  to  April.    The  Maximum 
Facilities Special Tax does not increase annually. 

 
The Maximum Special Tax that may be levied on Developed Property is the sum of the

Undeveloped Property is not subject to the Public Safety Special Tax. 
 
In some instances an Assessor’s Parcel of Developed Property may contain more than 
one Land Use Class.  The Maximum Special Tax levied on an Assessor’s Parcel shall be the 
sum of the Maximum Special Tax levies that can be imposed on all Land Use Classes located 
on that Assessor’s Parcel.  The CFD Administrator's allocation to each type of property shall be 
final.    
 

For each Fiscal Year, the City shall levy the Combined Special Tax until the amount of 
the  Special  Tax  levied  equals  the  Special  Tax  Requirement.    "Special  Tax  Requirement" 
means that amount required in any Fiscal Year for the CFD to: (a) (i) pay debt service on all 
Outstanding Bonds for the calendar year that commences in such Fiscal Year; (ii) pay periodic 
costs on the Bonds, including but not limited to, credit enhancement and rebate payments on 
the  Bonds;  (iii)  pay  reasonable  Administrative  Expenses;  (iv)  pay  any  amounts  required  to 
establish  or  replenish  any  reserve  accounts  for  all  Outstanding  Bonds;  (v)  pay  directly  for 
acquisition  or  construction  of  authorized  facilities  to  be  constructed  or  acquired  by  the  CFD, 
except Special Taxes on Undeveloped Property shall not be levied for this purpose; (vi) pay for 
reasonably  anticipated  delinquent  Special  Taxes  based  on  the  delinquency  rate  for  Special 
Taxes levied  in the previous Fiscal Year; and (vii) pay for Public Safety Costs for Developed 
Property,  less  (b)  a  credit  for  funds  available  to  reduce  the  annual  Special  Tax  levy,  as 
determined by the CFD Administrator pursuant to the Indenture. 

 
 
The Combined Special Tax shall be levied each Fiscal Year as follows: 

 
First:  The Combined Special Tax shall be levied on each Assessor’s Parcel of 

Developed Property at 100% of the applicable Maximum Special Tax; 

 
Second:  If additional monies are needed to satisfy the Special Tax Requirement 
after  the  first  step  has  been  completed,  the  Facilities  Special  Tax  shall  be  levied 
Proportionately  on  each  Assessor's  Parcel  of  Final  Map  Residential  Property  at  up  to 
100%  of  the  Maximum  Special  Tax  for  Final  Map  Residential  Property.  Under  no 
circumstances shall Public Safety Special Taxes be levied under this second step;  

 

 

28 

 

 
Third:  If additional monies are needed to satisfy the Special Tax Requirement 
after the first two steps have been completed, the Facilities Special Tax shall be levied 
Proportionately on each Assessor's Parcel of Large Lot Property at up to 100% of the 
Maximum  Special  Tax  for  Large  Lot  Property.  Under  no  circumstances  shall  Public 
Safety Special Taxes be levied under this third step; 

 
Fourth:  If additional monies are needed to satisfy the Special Tax Requirement 
after the first three steps have been completed, then the Facilities Special Tax shall be 
levied  Proportionately  on  each  Assessor’s  Parcel  of  Tentative  Map  Property  at  up  to 
100% of the Maximum Special Tax for Tentative Map Property.  Under no circumstances 
shall Public Safety Special Taxes be levied under this fourth step; and; 

 
Fifth:    If  additional  monies  are  needed  to  satisfy  the  Special  Tax  Requirement 
after the first four steps have been completed, then the Facilities Special Tax shall be 
levied  Proportionately  on  each  Assessor’s  Parcel  of  Other  Taxable  Property  at  up  to 
100% of the Maximum Special Tax for Other Taxable Property.  Under no circumstances 
shall Public Safety Special Taxes be levied under this fifth step. 

 

Notwithstanding the above the Council may, in any Fiscal Year, levy Proportionately less 
than 100% of the Maximum Special Tax in step one (above), when (i) the Council is no longer 
required to levy a Combined Special Tax pursuant to steps two through five above in order to 
meet the Special Tax Requirement; (ii) all authorized CFD Bonds have already been issued or 
the Council has covenanted that it will not issue any additional CFD Bonds (except refunding 
bonds) to be supported by Special Taxes; and (iii) all authorized facilities have been constructed 
or acquired and paid for from Bonds and/or Special Taxes. 

 
Notwithstanding the above, under no circumstances will the Facilities Special Tax levied 
against any Assessor’s Parcel of Residential Property for which an occupancy permit for private 
residential  use  has  been  issued  be  increased  by  more  than  ten  percent  annually  up  to  the 
Maximum Special Tax as a consequence of delinquency or default by the owner of any other 
Assessor's Parcel within the CFD. 

 
The Facilities Special Tax may not be levied later than the 2045-46 Fiscal Year. 
 
Priority of Lien.  The principal of and interest on the CFD Bonds are payable from the 
Special  Tax  authorized  to  be  collected  within  each  respective  District,  and  payment  of  the 
Special Tax is secured by a lien on certain real property within such District.  Such lien is co-
equal to and independent of the lien for general taxes and any other liens imposed under the 
Act,  regardless  of  when  they  are  imposed  on  the  property  in  the  District.    The  imposition  of 
additional special taxes, assessments and general property taxes will increase the amount of 
independent and co-equal liens which must be satisfied in foreclosure.  The City, the County 
and certain other public agencies are authorized by the Act to form other community facilities 
districts  and  improvement  areas  and,  under  other  provisions  of  State  law,  to  form  special 
assessment districts, either or both of which could include all or a portion of the land within such 
District.   
 
Private liens, such as deeds of trust securing loans obtained by owners of property in the 
District,  may  be  placed  upon  property  in  the  District  at  any  time.    Under  California  law,  the 
Special Taxes have priority over all existing and future private liens imposed on property subject 
to the lien of the Special Taxes. 

29 

 

 
 
Parcels in the Districts are subject to a bonded special tax lien and non-bonded special 
taxes and assessments for services.  See “OWNERSHIP AND VALUE OF PROPERTY IN THE 
DISTRICTS – Direct and Overlapping Debt.” 
 
Limited  Obligation  Upon  Delinquency.    ALL  OBLIGATIONS  OF  THE  AUTHORITY 
 
UNDER THE TRUST AGREEMENT AND THE BONDS ARE SPECIAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE 
AUTHORITY, PAYABLE SOLELY FROM AND SECURED BY REVENUES.  THE CFD BONDS 
ARE LIMITED OBLIGATION BONDS UNDER THE ACT AND ARE PAYABLE SOLELY FROM 
AND  ARE  SECURED  SOLELY  BY  THE  SPECIAL  TAXES  AND  THE  AMOUNTS  IN  THE 
SPECIAL TAX FUND AND THE AMOUNTS IN THE LOCAL OBLIGATION RESERVE FUNDS.

BONDOWNERS  SHOULD  NOT  RELY  UPON  THE  CITY  TO  ADVANCE  MONIES  TO  THE 
SPECIAL  TAX  FUND.    NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  FOREGOING,  THE  CITY  MAY,  AT  ITS 
SOLE  OPTION  AND  IN  ITS  SOLE  DISCRETION  ELECT  TO  ADVANCE  AVAILABLE 
SURPLUS  FUNDS  OF  THE  CITY  TO  PAY  FOR  ANY  DELINQUENT  SPECIAL  TAXES 
PENDING SALE, REINSTATEMENT, OR REDEMPTION OF ANY DELINQUENT PROPERTY. 
 

 

THE DISTRICTS 

 
This Official Statement presents certain information describing East Franklin CFD and 
Poppy Ridge CFD on a combined basis for informational purposes.  However, the Bonds are 
secured by two distinct revenue streams: debt service on the East Franklin CFD Bonds and 
debt  service  on  the  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  Bonds.    See  “SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS  AND 
SOURCES OF PAYMENT THEREFOR.”  

 
There is no cross-collateralization of security or reserve accounts among the Districts.  
Neither series of  CFD Bonds secures the payment of debt service on the  other series, or is 
available  to  make  up  any  shortfall  in  funds  to  pay  debt  service  on  the  other  series  of  CFD 
Bonds:  the East Franklin CFD Special Taxes are available only to pay debt service on the East 
Franklin CFD Bonds and the Poppy Ridge CFD Special Taxes are available only to pay debt 
service on the Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds.  See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS AND SOURCES 
OF PAYMENT THEREFOR - Security for the CFD Bonds.”  

 
General 
 

The  City  is  located  approximately  4  miles  south  of  the  City  of  Sacramento  along 
Interstate 5 and State Highway 99. The City was incorporated on July 1, 2000 and has grown 
from  a  2001  population  of  approximately  75,300  to  a  current  population  of  approximately 
162,000.  

 
The Districts lie within the City in an area in which land uses are designated primarily 

residential, with recent development proceeding in accordance with approved specific plans. 
 
The  City  has  experienced  substantial  growth  between  its  incorporation  in  2000  and 
 
2015, and the Districts largely comprise a part of the new home developments from that period 
and are within a primarily residential portion of the City.  Land in the Districts is nearly built-out 
and are part of the transition from previous land use for agricultural or grazing purposes toward 

30 

 

 

 

a mixture of urban land uses, which transition has also occurred in other areas of the City since 
2000.    As  the  real  estate  downturn  recovers,  residential  demand  appears  to  be  growing  and 
new development appears to be reactivating in the City, with homebuilders planning to offer new 
homes for sale in several areas, including near to the Districts.  
 

Flood Zone.  According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood 
Insurance  Rate  Map  (FIRM),  Community  Panel  060262-0315D  with  an  effective  date  of 
February 4, 1998, and Community Panel 060262-0320E effective July 6, 1998, a portion of the 
Districts  was  in  the  100-year  flood  plain,  however  subsequent  drainage  improvements  and 
Letter Of Map Revisions (LOMRs) have removed those areas from the 100-year floodplain to 
allow development to proceed. 

 
Seismicity.  According  to  the  State  of  California  Seismic  Safety  Commission,  the 
Sacramento Metropolitan area in which the Districts are located is designated as Earthquake 
Zone 3, a moderate damage zone, which is the lowest risk zone in California.  The designation

within the boundaries of the City.   

 
The  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  consists  of  approximately  910  gross  acres.    At  the  time  of  its 
formation,  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  was  projected  to  contain  3,798  single  family  homes,  460  multi-
family units and 2.9 acres of commercial property at full build-out. Home construction began in 
2003.  As of the end of January 1, 2015, approximately 3,955 single-family homes had been 
constructed and an additional 47 single-family building permits had been issued for single-family 
parcels.  The  Poppy  Ridge  CFD  also  includes  one  commercial  use  parcel,  which  has  been 
developed and 154 multi-family use parcels, which have been developed.  See the tables under 
the  caption  “OWNERSHIP  AND  VALUE  OF  PROPERTY  IN  THE  DISTRICTS  –  Valuation  of 
Property” below. 

 
The maximum annual facilities special tax in the Poppy Ridge CFD in Fiscal Year 2014-
15 was $965 for single family homes and $4,825 per net acre for multi-family and commercial 
properties.   
 

OWNERSHIP AND VALUE OF PROPERTY WITHIN THE DISTRICTS 

 

Ownership of Property  

 
Unpaid  Special Taxes do not constitute a personal indebtedness of the owners of the 
parcels within the Districts and the owners have made no commitment to pay the principal of or 
interest on the CFD Bonds or the Bonds or to support payment of the CFD Bonds or the Bonds 
in any manner.  There is no assurance that the owners have the ability to pay the special taxes 
or that, even if they have the ability, they will choose to pay such taxes.  An owner may elect to 
not pay the special taxes when due and cannot be legally compelled to do so.  Neither the City 
nor  any  Bondholder  will  have  the  ability  at  any  time  to  seek  payment  from  the  owners  of 
property within the Districts of any special tax or any principal or interest due on the CFD Bonds 
or the Bonds, or the ability to control who becomes a subsequent owner of any property within 
the Districts. 
 

The property in the Districts is comprised principally of homes occupied by homeowners, 
and to a lesser extent, finished lots, some with homes under construction by homebuilders, lots 
under  construction,  multifamily  and  commercial  parcels,  and  unsubdivided  land  available  for 
development. See “-Valuation of Property in the Districts” below.

Teeter Plan.  In 1949, the California Legislature enacted an alternative method for the 
distribution of property taxes to local agencies.  This method, known as the “Teeter Plan,” is 
found in Sections 4701-4717 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code.  Upon adoption and 
implementation of this method by a county board of supervisors, local agencies for which the 
county collects property taxes and certain other public agencies and taxing areas located in the 
county  receive  annually  the  full  amount  of  their  shares  of  property  taxes  and  other  levies 
collected on the secured roll, including delinquent property taxes which have yet to be collected.  
While  the  county  bears  the  risk  of  loss  on  unpaid  delinquent  taxes,  it  retains  the  penalties 
associated  with  delinquent  taxes  when  they  are  paid.    In  turn,  the  Teeter  Plan  provides 
participating local agencies with stable cash flow and the elimination of collection risk. 

 
Once adopted, a county’s Teeter Plan will remain in effect in perpetuity unless the board 
of supervisors orders its discontinuance or unless, prior to the commencement of a Fiscal Year, 
a petition for discontinuance is received and joined in by resolutions of the governing bodies of 
not  less  than  two-thirds  of  the  participating  districts  in  the  county.    An  electing  county  may, 
however, decide to discontinue the Teeter Plan with respect to any levying agency in the county 
if  the  board  of  supervisors,  by  action  taken  not  later  than  July  15  of  a  Fiscal  Year,  elects  to 
discontinue  the  procedure  with  respect  to  such  levying  agency  and  the  rate  of  secured  tax 
delinquencies  in  that  agency  in  any  year  exceeds  3%  of  the  total  of  all  taxes  levied  on  the 
secured roll by that agency.  

 
Under the Teeter Plan, a county must initially provide a participating local agency with 
95% of the estimated amount of the then-accumulated tax delinquencies (excluding penalties) 
for that agency.  After the initial distribution, each participating local agency receives annually 
100% of the secured property tax levies to which it is otherwise entitled, regardless of whether 
the county has actually collected the levies. 

 
If  any  tax  or  assessment  which  was  distributed  to  a  Teeter  Plan  participant  is 
subsequently  changed  by  correction,  cancellation  or  refund,  a  pro  rata  adjustment  for  the 
amount of the change is made on the records of the treasurer and auditor of the county.  Such 

 

 

35 

 

adjustment for a decrease in the tax or assessment is treated by the county as an interest-free 
offset against future advances of tax levies under the Teeter Plan. 

 
The Districts participate in the County of Sacramento’s Teeter Plan. Under the County’s 
Teeter plan, the County decides whether or not to purchase a district’s delinquent direct levies 
each year. The County’s Teeter Plan is subject to certain conditions and limitations. The County 
has purchased the Districts’ Fiscal Year 2013-14 delinquent taxes as shown in the preceding 
tables.  There can be no assurance that the County will not modify or eliminate its Teeter Plan, 
or choose to remove Districts from its Teeter Plan, while the Bonds are outstanding. 

 

Valuation of Property 
 

The value of the land within the Districts is a critical factor in determining the investment 
quality of the Bonds.  If a property owner defaults in the payment of a Special Tax, the City's 
only remedy is to foreclose on the delinquent property in an attempt to obtain funds with which 
to pay the delinquent Special Taxes.  See "SECURITY FOR THE BONDS AND SOURCES OF 
PAYMENT  THEREFOR  -  Security  for  the  CFD  Bonds  – Covenants  of  the  City"  and  "RISK 
FACTORS - Bankruptcy Delays."  Reductions in District property values due to a downturn in 
the economy, natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods, stricter land use regulations or 
other events could have an adverse impact on the security for payment of the Special Taxes.   

 
The  Special  Tax  is  levied  on  each  parcel  within  the  Districts  and  only  the  respective 
individual parcel is responsible for such Special Tax. In comparing the aggregate value of the 
real property within the Districts and the principal amount of the Bonds, it should be noted that 
only the Assessor’s parcel of real property upon which there is a delinquent Special Tax can be 
foreclosed  upon.    All  of  the  real  property  within  the  Districts  cannot  be  foreclosed  upon  as  a 
whole to pay delinquent Special Taxes unless all of the property is subject to delinquent Special 
Taxes.    Individual  parcels  may  be  foreclosed  upon  to  pay  delinquent  Special  Taxes  levied 
against such parcels only.  See "SECURITY FOR THE BONDS AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT 
THEREFOR - Security for the CFD Bonds.” 
 

The  principal  amount  of  the  Bonds  will  not  be  allocated  pro-rata  among  the  parcels 
within the Districts; rather, the annual Special Taxes for the Districts will be billed annually for 
each parcel within the Districts.  Upon sale of developed parcels, the buyer typically acquires 
the property subject to the unpaid portion of any special taxes and special taxes levied against 
the parcel purchased.  Special Taxes and special taxes are not required to be removed from the 
property and are not required to be, but may be, paid off in full upon transfer of property or upon 
development of the property. 

 

36 

 

Assessed Valuations. In connection with valuing property in the Districts, the City has 
obtained the 2014-15 County assessed valuation (the "Assessed Valuation") of the property in 
the Districts.  Due to the recent and ongoing nature of development of homes in the Districts, 
the  County  assessed  valuations  are  not  in  all  cases  reflective  of  most  current  development 
status, as is the case with certain properties in the Districts. As provided by Article XIII A of the 
California Constitution, county assessors' assessed values are to reflect market value as of the 
date  the  property  was  last  assessed  (or  1975,  which  ever  is  more  recent),  increased  by  a 
maximum of 2% per year.  Properties may be reassessed by the County only upon a change of 
at least 51% ownership of existing property or upon new construction.  The assessed values of 
parcels  in  the  Districts  thus  reflect,  for  undeveloped  parcels,  the  estimate  of  the  County 
Assessor  (the  "Assessor")  of  market  value  when  acquired  (or  1975,  whichever  is  later), 
possibly increased by 2% per year, and for parcels on which construction has occurred since 
their date of acquisition, the Assessor's estimate of market value as of the time of construction, 
possibly increased by 2% per year.  The actual market value of parcels in the Districts, if sold at 
foreclosure, may be higher or lower than the Assessor's assessed values, depending upon the 
date of the Assessor's most recent assessment.  The actual fair market value of any parcel can 
often  be  more  accurately  established  through  an  arms-length  sale  or  an  appraisal  by  an 
independent appraiser. 

 
Total Value Estimate of All Property.  The aggregate property valuation of the property 
in the Districts has been compiled using the County Assessed Valuation, as described above.  
The  total  estimated  valuation  of  all  property  in  the  Districts  subject  to  the  Special  Taxes  for 
various categories of property in the combined Districts is shown below.

Direct  Debt  Value  to  Lien  Ratios.  The  aggregate  Assessed  Valuation  of  taxable 
property in the Districts is approximately $3.01 billion, which is approximately 33.21 times the 
$90,630,000 aggregate principal amount of the Bonds. The aggregate Assessed Valuation of 
taxable property in the East Franklin CFD is approximately $1.68 billion, which is approximately 
34.20 times the $49,120,000 aggregate principal amount of the East Franklin CFD Bonds.  The

RISK FACTORS 

 

 

The purchase of the Bonds described in this Official Statement involves a degree of risk 
that may not be appropriate for some investors.  The following includes a discussion of some of 
the risks that should be considered before making an investment decision.  

Limited Obligation to Pay Debt Service 
 

The Bonds. The Bonds are special obligations of the Authority payable solely from and 
secured  solely  by  the  Revenues  and  funds  pledged  therefor  in  the  Indenture,  consisting 
primarily  of  debt  service  on  the  CFD  Bonds.    See  “SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS  AND 
SOURCES OF PAYMENT THEREFOR.”  

 
The CFD Bonds.  The City has no obligation to pay principal of or interest on the CFD 
Bonds if Special Tax collections are delinquent or insufficient, other than from amounts, if any, 
on  deposit  in  the  Reserve  Account established for  the  CFD  Bonds  or  funds  derived  from  the 
foreclosure  and  sale  of  parcels  for  Special  Tax  delinquencies.    The  City  is  not  obligated  to 
advance funds to pay debt service on the CFD Bonds. 

Levy and Collection of the Special Taxes 
 

General.  The principal source of payment of principal of and interest on the CFD Bonds 
is the proceeds of the annual levy and collection of the Special Tax against property within the 
applicable District.   

 
Limitation on Special Tax Rate.  The annual levy of the Special Tax on any parcel is 
limited to the maximum Special Tax rate authorized in the applicable Special Tax Formula.  The 
levy  cannot  be  made  at  a  higher  rate  even  if  the  failure  to  do  so  means  that  the  estimated 
proceeds of the levy and collection of the Special Tax, together with other available funds, will 
not be sufficient to pay debt service on the CFD Bonds.  

 
No  Relationship  Between  Property  Value  and  Special  Tax  Levy.    Because  the 
Special Tax Formula is not based on property value, the levy of the Special Tax will rarely, if 
ever, result in a uniform relationship between the value of particular parcels of Taxable Property 
and the amount of the levy of the Special Tax against those parcels.  Thus, there will rarely, if 
ever, be a uniform relationship between the value of the parcels of Taxable Property and their 
proportionate share of debt service on the CFD Bonds, and certainly not a direct relationship. 

 
Factors that Could Lead to Special Tax Deficiencies.  The following are some of the 
factors that might cause the levy of the Special Tax on any particular parcel of Taxable Property 
to vary from the Special Tax that might otherwise be expected: 

Transfers  to  Governmental  Entities.    The  number  of  parcels  of  Taxable 
Property  could  be  reduced  through  the  acquisition  of  Taxable  Property  by  a 
governmental  entity  (by  exercise  of  its  rights  as  mortgage  guarantor,  or  for  other 
reasons) and failure of the government to pay the Special Tax based upon a claim of 
exemption or, in the case of the federal government or an agency thereof, immunity from 
taxation, thereby resulting in an increased tax burden on the remaining taxed parcels.

Property Tax Delinquencies.  Failure of the owners of Taxable Property to pay 
property  taxes  (and,  consequently,  the  Special  Tax),  or  delays  in  the  collection  of  or 
inability to collect the Special Tax by tax sale or foreclosure and sale of the delinquent 
parcels, could result in a deficiency in the collection of Special Taxes.  For a summary of 
Special Tax collections in the Districts, see “OWNERSHIP AND VALUE OF PROPERTY 
WITHIN THE DISTRICTS – Tax Collections and Delinquencies.”  
 

Delays  Following  Delinquencies  and  Foreclosure  Sales.    The  CFD  Bonds 
Fiscal  Agent  Agreement  provides  that  the  Special  Tax  is  to  be  collected  in  the  same 
manner as ordinary ad valorem property taxes are collected and, except as provided in 
the special covenant for foreclosure described in “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS AND 
SOURCES OF PAYMENT THEREFOR - Security for the CFD Bonds” and in the Mello-
Roos Act, is subject to the same penalties and the same procedure, sale and lien priority 
in  case  of  delinquency  as  is  provided  for  ordinary  ad valorem  property  taxes.    Under 
these procedures, if taxes are unpaid for a period of five years or more, the property is 
subject to sale by the County.   
 

If  sales  or  foreclosures  of  property  are  necessary,  there  could  be  a  delay  in 
payments  to  the  Authority,  as  owner  of  the  CFD  Bonds,  pending  such  sales  or  the 
prosecution of foreclosure proceedings and receipt by the City of the proceeds of sale if 
the Reserve Account for the applicable CFD Bonds is depleted.  See “SECURITY FOR 
THE  BONDS  AND  SOURCES  OF  PAYMENT  THEREFOR  -  Security  for  the  CFD 
Bonds.” 
 

Payment of Special Taxes is not a Personal Obligation of the Property Owners 
 

Property  Owners  are  not  personally  obligated  to  pay  their  respective  Special  Taxes.  
Rather, the Special Taxes are obligations only against the respective parcels against which they 
are  levied.    If,  after  a  default  in  the  payment  of  the  Special  Tax  and  a  foreclosure  sale,  the 
resulting proceeds are insufficient, taking into account other obligations also constituting a lien 
against the parcel, the City has no personal recourse against the parcel owner. 

Assessed Valuations 
 

The City has not commissioned an appraisal of the parcels in either CFD in connection 
with the issuance of the Bonds.  Therefore, the estimated valuation of the Taxable Property in 
the Districts set forth in this Official Statement are based on the County Assessor’s values.  The 
assessed  value  is  not  an  indication  of  what  a  willing  buyer  might  pay  for  a  property.    The 
assessed  value  is  not  evidence  of  future  value  because  future  facts  and  circumstances  may 
differ significantly from the present. 

 
No  assurance  can  be  given  that  any  of  the  Taxable  Property  in  the  Districts  could  be 
sold for the assessed value if that property should become delinquent and subject to foreclosure 
proceedings.  

Property Values 
 

The value of Taxable Property within the Districts is a critical factor in determining the 
investment quality of the Bonds.  If a parcel owner defaults in the payment of the Special Taxes, 
the City’s only remedy is to foreclose on the delinquent property.

in the Districts.  

 

The following is a discussion of specific risk factors that could affect the value of property 

Prolonged Economic Downturn. Land values in and around the City have been 
adversely  affected  by  current  economic  conditions.    To  the  extent  that  the  economic 
downturn is prolonged, property values could remain flat for an indefinite period. 

 
Declines  in  home  values  in  the  Districts  could  also  result  in  property  owner 
unwillingness  or  inability  to  pay  mortgage  payments,  as  well  as  ad  valorem  property 
taxes and Special Taxes, when due.  Under such circumstances, bankruptcies are likely 
to increase.  Bankruptcy by homeowners with delinquent Special Taxes would delay the 
commencement and completion of foreclosure proceedings.   

 
Risks Related to Mortgage Loans.  Although residential projects that have their 
homes built and occupied by homeowners are typically viewed as providing bondholders 
with strong credits, some of the recent home purchasers, especially those during 2004 to 
2007,  may  face  challenges  in  making  their  mortgage  and  tax  payments  on  a  timely 
basis, due to their initial high loan to value ratios, creative mortgage loan structures, and 
current negative equity levels.  

 
Recent  events  in  the  United  States  and  world-wide  capital  markets  have 
adversely affected the availability of mortgage loans to homeowners, including potential 
buyers of homes within the Districts.  Any such unavailability could hinder the ability of 
the  current  homeowners  to  resell  their  homes,  and  adversely  affect  the  market  prices 
available to current homeowners.  

 
Natural Disasters.  The value of the parcels in the Districts in the future can be 
adversely affected by a variety of natural occurrences, particularly those that may affect 
infrastructure and other public improvements and private improvements on the parcels in 
the Districts and the continued habitability and enjoyment of such private improvements.  
For example, the areas in and surrounding the Districts, like those in much of California, 
may  be  subject  to  earthquakes  or  other  unpredictable  seismic  activity,  however,  the 
Districts are not located in a seismic special studies zone.   

 
Other  natural  disasters  could  include,  without  limitation,  landslides,  floods, 
droughts or tornadoes.  One or more natural disasters could occur and could result in 
damage  to  improvements  of  varying  seriousness.    The  damage  may  entail  significant 
repair  or  replacement  costs  and  that  repair  or  replacement  may  never  occur  either 
because  of  the  cost,  or  because  repair  or  replacement  will  not  facilitate  habitability  or 
other use, or because other considerations preclude such repair or replacement.  Under 
any of these circumstances there could be significant delinquencies in the payment of 
Special Taxes, and the value of the parcels may well depreciate.   

  
Hazardous Substances.  One of the most serious risks in terms of the potential 
reduction  in  the  property  values  is  a  claim  with  regard  to  a  hazardous  substance.    In 
general,  the  owners  and  operators  of  property  may  be  required  by  law  to  remedy 
conditions  of  the  parcel  relating  to  releases  or  threatened  releases  of  hazardous 
substances.  The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and 
Liability Act of 1980, sometimes referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund Act,” is the 
most well-known and widely applicable of these laws, but California laws with regard to 
hazardous  substances  are  also  stringent  and  similar.    Under  many  of  these  laws,  the 

52 

 

 

owner or operator is obligated to remedy a hazardous substance condition of property 
whether or not the owner or operator has anything to do with creating or handling the 
hazardous substance.  The effect, therefore, should any of the Taxable Property in the 
Districts be affected by a hazardous substance, is to reduce the marketability and value 
of  the  parcel  by  the  costs  of  remedying  the  condition,  because  the  purchaser,  upon 
becoming owner, will become obligated to remedy the condition just as is the seller. 

 
Although the City is not aware that the owner or operator of any of the Taxable 
Property in the Districts has such a current liability, it is possible that such liabilities do 
currently exist.  Further, it is possible that liabilities may arise in the future resulting from 
the existence, currently, on the parcel of a substance presently classified as hazardous 
but that has not been released or the release of which is not presently threatened, or 
may  arise  in  the  future  resulting  from  the  existence,  currently  on  the  parcel  of  a 
substance  not  presently  classified  as  hazardous  but  that  may  in  the  future  be  so 
classified.    Further,  such  liabilities  may  arise  not  simply  from  the  existence  of  a 
hazardous substance but from the method of handling it.  All of these possibilities could 
significantly  affect  the  property  values  that  would  otherwise  be  realized  upon  a 
delinquency.    

 
No  information  is  available  as  to  the  existence  of  any  hazardous  substances 

within the Districts.  

 
Other Factors.  Other factors that could adversely affect property values in the 
Districts  include,  among  others,  relocation  of  employers  out  of  the  area,  shortages  of 
water,  electricity,  natural  gas  or  other  utilities,  and  destruction  of  property  caused  by 
man-made disasters. 

California Drought; State of Emergency Proclamation  

On  January  17,  2014,  with  California  facing  water  shortfalls  in  the  then-driest  year  in 
recorded state history, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. proclaimed a State of Emergency and 
directed state officials to take all necessary actions to prepare for these drought conditions.  In 
the State of Emergency declaration, Governor  Brown directed state officials to assist farmers 
and communities that are economically impacted by dry conditions and to ensure the State can 
respond  if  Californians  face  drinking  water  shortages.    The  Governor  also  directed  state 
agencies  to  use  less  water  and  hire  more  firefighters  and  initiated  a  greatly  expanded  water 
conservation  public  awareness.    In  addition,  the  proclamation  gave  state  water  officials  more 
flexibility to manage supply throughout California under drought conditions. 

The  Governor’s  drought  State  of  Emergency 

the 
administration has taken to ensure that California is prepared for record dry conditions.  In May 
2013, Governor Brown issued an Executive Order to direct state water officials to expedite the 
review and processing of voluntary transfers of water and water rights.  In December 2014, the 
Governor  formed  a  Drought  Task  Force  to  review  expected  water  allocations,  California’s 
preparedness for water scarcity and whether conditions merit a drought declaration. 

follows  a  series  of  actions 

On April 1, 2015, for the first time in state history, the Governor directed the State Water 
Resources Control Board to implement mandatory water reductions in cities and towns across 
California to reduce water usage by 25%.  This savings amounts to approximately 1.5 million 
acre-feet of water over the following nine months.  

53 

 

California  set  a  new  "low  water"  mark  on  April  1,  2015,  with  its  early-April  snowpack 
measurement.    The  statewide  electronic  reading  of  the  snowpack's  water  content  stood  at  5 
percent of the April 1st average.  April 1, 2015’s content was only 1.4 inches, or 5%, of the 28-
inch  average.    The  lowest  previous  reading  since  1950  was  25%  of  average,  so  water  year 
2015 is the driest winter in California's written record. 

The  implementation  of  mandatory  water  reductions  is  ongoing.  The  Authority  cannot 
predict how long the drought conditions will last, what effect drought conditions may have on 
property  values  or  whether  or  to  what  extent  water  reduction  requirements  may  affect  the 
Districts. 
 
Other Possible Claims Upon the Property Values 
 

While  the  Special  Taxes  are  secured  by  the  Taxable  Property  in  the  Districts,  the 
security only extends to the value of such property that is not subject to priority and parity liens 
and similar claims. 

 
Tables listing of the outstanding governmental obligations affecting each District are set 
forth  above  under  “OWNERSHIP  AND  VALUE  OF  PROPERTY  WITHIN  THE  DISTRICTS  – 
Direct and Overlapping Governmental Liens.”  

 
In addition, other governmental obligations may be authorized and undertaken or issued 
in the future, the tax, assessment or charge for which may become an obligation of one or more 
of the parcels within the Districts, and may be secured by a lien on a parity with the lien of the 
Special Taxes securing the CFD Bonds.  

 
In  general,  the  Special  Taxes,  and  all  other  taxes,  assessments  and  charges  also 
collected  on  the  tax  roll,  are  on  a  parity,  that  is,  are  of  equal  priority.    Questions  of  priority 
become  significant  when  collection  of  one  or  more  of  the  taxes,  assessments  or  charges  is 
sought by some other procedure, such as foreclosure and sale.  If proceedings are brought to 
foreclose  a  delinquency,  the  Special  Taxes  will  generally  be  on  parity  with  the  other  taxes, 
assessments and charges, and will share the proceeds of such foreclosure proceedings on a 
pro-rata basis.   

 

54 

 

Enforcement of Special Taxes on Governmentally Owned Properties 
 

General.  The  ability  of  the  City  to  foreclose  the  lien  of  delinquent  unpaid  Special  Tax 
installments  may  be  limited  with  regard  to  properties  in  which  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance 
Corporation (the “FDIC”), the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, or other 
federal agency has or obtains an interest. 

 
Federal  courts  have  held  that,  based  on  the  supremacy  clause  of  the  United  States 
Constitution,  in  the  absence  of  Congressional  intent  to  the  contrary,  a  state  or  local  agency 
cannot  foreclose  to  collect  delinquent  taxes  or  assessments  if  foreclosure  would  impair  the 
federal government interest.  

 
The  supremacy  clause  of  the  United  States  Constitution  reads  as  follows:  “This 
Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and 
all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the 
supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in 
the Constitution or Laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.” 

 
This  means  that,  unless  Congress  has  otherwise  provided,  if  a  federal  governmental 
entity owns a parcel that is subject to Special Taxes within the Districts, but does not pay taxes 
and assessments levied on the parcel (including Special Taxes), the applicable state and local 
governments cannot foreclose on the parcel to collect the delinquent taxes and assessments.   

 
Moreover,  unless  Congress  has  otherwise  provided,  if  the  federal  government  has  a 
mortgage  interest  in  the  parcel  and  the  City  wishes  to  foreclose  on  the  parcel  as  a  result  of 
delinquent Special Taxes, the property cannot be sold at a foreclosure sale unless it can be sold 
for an amount sufficient to pay delinquent taxes and assessments on a parity with the Special 
Taxes  and  preserve  the  federal  government’s  mortgage  interest.    In  Rust  v.  Johnson  (9th 
Circuit;  1979)  597  F.2d  174,  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeal,  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  the 
Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) is a federal instrumentality for purposes of this 
doctrine,  and  not  a  private  entity,  and  that,  as  a  result,  an  exercise  of  state  power  over  a 
mortgage  interest  held  by  FNMA  constitutes  an  exercise  of  state  power  over  property  of  the 
United States.   

 
Neither  the  City  nor  the  Authority  has  undertaken  to  determine  whether  any  federal 
governmental  entity  currently  has,  or  is  likely  to  acquire,  any  interest  (including  a  mortgage 
interest) in any of the parcels subject to the Special Taxes within the Districts.  No assurance 
can be given as to the likelihood that the risks described above will materialize while the CFD 
Bonds are outstanding. 

 
FDIC.    If  any  financial  institution  making  any  loan  secured  by  real  property  within  the 
Districts is taken over by the FDIC, and prior thereto or thereafter the loan (or loans) goes into 
default, resulting in ownership of the property by the FDIC, then the ability of the City to collect 
interest  and  penalties  specified  by  State  law  and  to  foreclose  the  lien  of  delinquent  unpaid 
Special Taxes may be limited. 

 
The FDIC’s policy statement regarding the payment of state and local real property taxes 
(the “Policy Statement”) provides that property owned by the FDIC is subject to state and local 
real property taxes only if those taxes are assessed according to the property’s value, and that 
the FDIC is immune from real property taxes assessed on any basis other than property value.  
According  to  the  Policy  Statement,  the  FDIC  will  pay  its  property  tax  obligations  when  they 

55 

 

become due and payable and will pay claims for delinquent property taxes as promptly as is 
consistent with sound business practice and the orderly administration of the institution’s affairs, 
unless abandonment of the FDIC’s interest in the property is appropriate.  The FDIC will pay 
claims for interest on delinquent property taxes owed at the rate provided under state law, to the 
extent  the  interest  payment  obligation  is  secured  by  a  valid  lien.    The  FDIC  will  not  pay  any 
amounts  in  the  nature  of  fines  or  penalties  and  will  not  pay  nor  recognize  liens  for  such 
amounts.  If any property taxes (including interest) on FDIC-owned property are secured by a 
valid lien (in effect before the property became owned by the FDIC), the FDIC will pay those 
claims.  The Policy Statement further provides that no property of the FDIC is subject to levy, 
attachment, garnishment, foreclosure or sale without the FDIC’s consent.  In addition, the FDIC 
will not permit a lien or security interest held by the FDIC to be eliminated by foreclosure without 
the FDIC’s consent. 

 
The Policy Statement states that the FDIC generally will not pay non-ad valorem taxes, 
including special taxes and assessments, on property in which it has a fee interest unless the 
amount of tax is fixed at the time that the FDIC acquires its fee interest in the property, nor will it 
recognize  the  validity  of  any  lien  to  the  extent  it  purports  to  secure  the  payment  of  any  such 
amounts.  Special taxes imposed under the Mello-Roos Act and a special tax formula, which 
determines the special tax due each year, are specifically identified in the Policy Statement as 
being  imposed  each  year  and  therefore  covered  by  the  FDIC’s  federal  immunity.    The  Ninth 
Circuit issued a ruling on August 28, 2001, in which it determined that the FDIC, as a federal 
agency, is exempt from Mello-Roos special taxes. 

 
The Authority and the City are unable to predict what effect the application of the Policy 
Statement  would  have  in  the  event  of  a  delinquency  in  the  payment  of  Special  Taxes  on  a 
parcel within the Districts, in which the FDIC has or obtains an interest, although prohibiting the 
lien  of  the  Special  Taxes  to  be  foreclosed  out  at  a  judicial  foreclosure  sale  could  reduce  or 
eliminate the number of persons willing to purchase a parcel at a foreclosure sale.  Such an 
outcome could cause a draw on either the Reserve Accounts established for the CFD Bonds 
and perhaps, ultimately, if enough property were to become owned by the FDIC, a default in 
payment on the CFD Bonds. 

 
Exemptions Under Special Tax Formula and the Mello-Roos Act.  Certain properties 
are exempt from the Special Tax in accordance with the Special Tax Formula and the Mello-
Roos Act, which provides that properties or entities of the state, federal or local government are 
exempt from the Special Tax; provided, however, that property within the Districts acquired by a 
public entity through a negotiated transaction or by gift or devise, which is not otherwise exempt 
from the Special Tax, will continue to be subject to the Special Tax.  

 
In addition, although the Mello-Roos Act provides that if property subject to the Special 
Tax is acquired by a public entity through eminent domain proceedings, the obligation to pay the 
Special Tax with respect to that property is to be treated as if it were a special assessment, the 
constitutionality and operation of these provisions of the Act have not been tested, meaning that 
such property could become exempt from the Special Tax.  The Mello-Roos Act further provides 
that  no  other  properties  or  entities  are  exempt  from  the  Special  Tax  unless  the  properties  or 
entities are expressly exempted in a resolution of consideration to levy a new special tax or to 
alter the rate or method of apportionment of an existing special tax. 

 

 

 

56 

Depletion of Reserve Accounts 
 

The City will establish and maintain a Reserve Account for each series of CFD Bonds 
that may be used to pay principal of and interest on the related CFD Bonds if insufficient funds 
are available from the proceeds of the levy and collection of the Special Taxes against property 
within  the  applicable  District.    See  “SECURITY  FOR  THE  BONDS  AND  SOURCES  OF 
PAYMENT THEREFOR - Security for the CFD Bonds – Reserve Accounts.”  

 
If funds in a Reserve Account for a series of CFD Bonds are depleted, the funds can be 
replenished from the proceeds of the levy and collection of the Special Tax that are in excess of 
the amount required to pay all amounts to be paid to the Authority under the applicable  CFD 
Fiscal Agent Agreement.  However, no replenishment from the proceeds of a Special Tax levy 
can occur so long as the proceeds that are collected from the levy of the Special Tax against 
property within a District at the maximum Special Tax rates, together with other available funds, 
remain insufficient to pay all such amounts.  Thus, it is possible that a Reserve Account for a 
series of CFD Bonds will be depleted and not be replenished by the levy of the Special Tax. 

 
Each Reserve Account for the CFD Bonds is available only for the series of CFD Bonds 
to which it relates and no series of CFD Bonds or the pledge of Special Taxes to pay such CFD 
Bonds is cross-collateralized to any other series.  
 
Bankruptcy Delays 
 

The payment of the Special Taxes, and the ability of the City to foreclose the lien of a 
delinquent unpaid Special Tax, may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws generally 
affecting creditors' rights or by State laws relating to judicial foreclosure.   

 
The  various  legal  opinions  to  be  delivered  concurrently  with  the  delivery  of  the  Bonds 
(including Bond Counsel's approving legal opinion) will be qualified as to the enforceability of 
the various legal instruments by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other 
similar  laws  affecting  creditors'  rights,  by  the  application  of  equitable  principles  and  by  the 
exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases. 

 
Although  bankruptcy  proceedings  would  not  cause  the  Special  Taxes  to  become 
extinguished,  bankruptcy  of  a  property  owner  or  any  other  person  claiming  an  interest  in  the 
property could result in a delay in superior court foreclosure proceedings and could result in the 
possibility  of  Special  Tax  installments  not  being  paid  in  part  or  in  full.    Such  a  delay  would 
increase the likelihood of a delay or default in payment of the principal of and interest on the 
CFD Bonds, as applicable.   

 

 

Disclosure to Future Purchasers 
 

The City has recorded, in the Office of the County Recorder, a notice of the Special Tax 
lien  with  respect  to  the  Districts.    While  title  companies  normally  refer  to  such  notices  in  title 
reports,  there  can  be  no  guarantee  that  such  reference  will  be  made  or,  if  made,  that  a 
prospective purchaser or lender will consider the obligations represented by the Special Taxes 
in the purchase of a parcel of land or a home in the Districts, or the lending of money secured 
by property in the Districts.   

 

 

 

57 

 

No Acceleration; Right to Pursue Remedies 

 
Neither the Bonds nor the CFD Bonds contain a provision allowing for acceleration if a 
payment  default  or  other  default  occurs  under  the  Indenture  or  the  CFD  Bonds  Fiscal  Agent 
Agreements.    See  “APPENDIX  A  –  Summary  of  Certain  Provisions  of  Principal  Legal 
Documents.”   

 
So long as the Bonds are in book-entry form, DTC will be the sole Bond Owner and will 
be  entitled  to  exercise  all  rights  and  remedies  of  Bond  Owners  under  the  Bonds  and  the 
Indenture. 

 

Loss of Tax Exemption 
 

As  discussed  under  the  caption  “LEGAL  MATTERS  –  Tax  Matters,”  interest  on  the 
Bonds  might  become  includable  in  gross  income  for  purposes  of  federal  income  taxation 
retroactive  to  the  date  the  Bonds  were  issued  as  a  result  of  future  acts  or  omissions  of  the 
Authority in violation of its covenants in the Indenture, or of the City in violation of its covenants 
in the CFD Bonds Fiscal Agent Agreements.   

 
The Indenture does not contain a special redemption feature triggered by the occurrence 
of an event of taxability.  As a result, if interest on the Bonds were to be includable in gross 
income  for  purposes  of  federal  income  taxation,  the  Bonds  would  continue  to  remain 
outstanding  until  maturity  unless  earlier  redeemed  pursuant  to  mandatory  redemption.    See 
“THE BONDS – Redemption.” 

 
In  addition,  Congress  has  considered  in  the  past,  is  currently  considering  and  may 
consider in the future, legislative proposals, including some that carry retroactive effective dates, 
that, if enacted, would alter or eliminate the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax 
purposes  of  interest  on  municipal  bonds,  such  as  the  Bonds.    Prospective  purchasers  of  the 
Bonds  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding  any  pending  or  proposed  federal  tax 
legislation. 

Voter Initiatives 
 

Under the California Constitution, the power of initiative is reserved to the voters for the 
purpose  of  enacting  statutes  and  constitutional  amendments.    Since  1978,  the  voters  have 
exercised  this  power  through  the  adoption  of  Proposition  13  and  similar  measures,  including 
Proposition 218, which was approved in the general election held on November 5, 1996, and 
Proposition 26, which was approved on November 2, 2010. 

 
Any such initiative may affect the collection of fees, taxes and other types of revenue by 
local  agencies  such  as  the  City.    Subject  to  overriding  federal  constitutional  principles,  such 
collection may be materially and adversely affected by voter-approved initiatives, possibly to the 
extent  of  creating  cash-flow  problems  in  the  payment  of  outstanding  obligations  such  as  the 
CFD Bonds. 

 
Proposition  218—Voter  Approval  for  Local  Government  Taxes—Limitation  on  Fees, 
Assessments,  and  Charges—Initiative  Constitutional  Amendment,  added  Articles  XIIIC  and 
XIIID to the California Constitution, imposing certain vote requirements and other limitations on 
the imposition of new or increased taxes, assessments and property-related fees and charges.   

 

 

58 

 

 

 
 

 

On  November  2,  2010,  California  voters  approved  Proposition  26,  entitled  the 
“Supermajority Vote to Pass New Taxes and Fees Act”. Section 1 of Proposition 26 declares 
that Proposition 26 is intended to limit the ability of the State Legislature and local government 
to circumvent existing restrictions on increasing taxes by defining the new or expanded taxes as 
“fees.”  Proposition  26  amended  Articles  XIIIA  and  XIIIC  of  the  State  Constitution.  The 
amendments to Article XIIIA limit the ability of the State Legislature to impose higher taxes (as 
defined in Proposition 26) without a two-thirds vote of the Legislature.  Article XIIIC requires that 
all  new  local  taxes  be  submitted  to  the  electorate  before  they  become  effective.    Taxes  for 
general governmental purposes require a majority vote and taxes for specific purposes (“special 
taxes”) require a two-thirds vote. 

 
The Special Taxes and the CFD Bonds were each authorized by not less than a two-
thirds vote of the landowners within the CFD who constituted the qualified electors at the time of 
such voted authorization.  The City believes, therefore, that issuance of the CFD Bonds does 
not require the conduct of further proceedings under the Act, Proposition 218 or Proposition 26. 

 
Like  their  antecedents,  Proposition  218  and  Proposition  26  are  likely  to  undergo  both 
judicial and legislative scrutiny before the impact on the Districts can be determined.  Certain 
provisions  of  Proposition  218  and  Proposition  26  may  be  examined  by  the  courts  for  their 
constitutionality under both State and federal constitutional law, the outcome of which cannot be 
predicted.   

Secondary Market for Bonds 
 

There can be no guarantee that there will be a secondary market for the Bonds or, if a 
secondary market exists, that any Bonds can be sold for any particular price.  Prices of bond 
issues for which a market is being made will depend upon then-prevailing circumstances.  Such 
prices could be substantially different from the original purchase price.   

 
No assurance can be given that the market price for the Bonds will not be affected by 
the introduction or enactment of any future legislation (including without limitation amendments 
to the Internal Revenue Code), or changes in interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code, or 
any  action  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  publication  of 
proposed  or  final  regulations,  the  issuance  of  rulings,  the  selection  of  the  Bonds  for  audit 
examination, or the course or result of any Internal Revenue Service audit or examination of the 
Bonds or obligations that present similar tax issues as the Bonds.  

THE AUTHORITY 

 

The  Authority  is  a  joint  exercise  of  powers  authority  duly  organized  and  operating 
pursuant  to  Article 1  (commencing  with  Section  6500)  of  Chapter 5,  Division 7,  Title 1  of  the 
California Government Code, and pursuant to a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement entered 
into  in  2005  by  and  among  the  City  and  the  Elk  Grove  Parking  Authority,  and  is  qualified  to 
assist in financing projects and certain public improvements and to issue the Bonds under the 
Marks-Roos Local Bond Pooling Act of 1985, being Article 4 of Chapter 5, Division 7, Title 1 of 
the California Government Code.  The Authority has no taxing power.  The Authority and the 
City  are  each  separate  and  distinct  legal  entities,  and  the  debts  and  obligations  of  one  such 
entity are not debts or obligations of the other entity. 

59 

 

 
 

 

 

The Authority was established for the purpose of financing the acquisition, construction, 
improvement  and  equipping  of  public  capital  improvements.    The  governing  board  of  the 
Authority is the City Council of the City. 

LEGAL MATTERS 

Tax Matters 

 
In the opinion of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, San Francisco, California, 
Bond  Counsel,  subject,  however  to  the  qualifications  set  forth  below,  under  existing  law,  the 
interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and such 
interest  is  not  an  item  of  tax  preference  for  purposes  of  the  federal  alternative  minimum  tax 
imposed on individuals and corporations, provided, however, that, for the purpose of computing 
the  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  corporations  (as  defined  for  federal  income  tax 
purposes), such interest is taken into account in determining certain income and earnings. 

 
The opinions set forth in the preceding paragraph are subject to the condition that the 
Authority and the City comply with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended  (the  "Tax Code"),  that  must  be  satisfied  subsequent  to  the  issuance  of  the  Bonds.  
The Authority and the City have covenanted to comply with each such requirement.  Failure to 
comply  with  certain  of  such  requirements  may  cause  the  inclusion  of  such  interest  in  gross 
income for federal income tax purposes to be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds.  

 
If the initial offering price to the public (excluding bond houses and brokers) at which a 
Bond  is  sold  is  less  than  the  amount  payable  at  maturity  thereof,  then  such  difference 
constitutes "original issue discount" for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California 
personal  income  taxes.    If  the  initial  offering  price  to  the  public  (excluding  bond  houses  and 
brokers) at which a Bond is sold is greater than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then 
such difference constitutes "original issue premium" for purposes of federal income taxes and 
State of California personal income taxes.   De minimis original issue discount and original issue 
premium is disregarded.  

 
Under the Tax Code, original issue discount is treated as interest excluded from federal 
gross income and exempt from State of California personal income taxes to the extent properly 
allocable to each owner thereof subject to the limitations described in the first paragraph of this 
section.  The original issue discount accrues over the term to maturity of the Bond on the basis 
of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date (with straight-
line  interpolations  between  compounding  dates).    The  amount  of  original  issue  discount 
accruing during each period is added to the adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable 
gain upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Bond.  The 
Tax  Code  contains  certain  provisions  relating  to  the  accrual  of  original  issue  discount  in  the 
case  of  purchasers  of  the  Bonds  who  purchase  the  Bonds  after  the  initial  offering  of  a 
substantial  amount  of  such  maturity.    Owners  of  such  Bonds  should  consult  their  own  tax 
advisors  with  respect  to  the  tax  consequences  of  ownership  of  Bonds  with  original  issue 
discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do not purchase in the original offering, the 
allowance  of  a  deduction  for  any  loss  on  a  sale  or  other  disposition,  and  the  treatment  of 
accrued original issue discount on such Bonds under federal individual and corporate alternative 
minimum taxes. 

60 

 

 

 

 

Under the Tax Code, original issue premium is amortized on an annual basis over the 
term of the Bond (said term being the shorter of the Bond's maturity date or its call date).  The 
amount of original issue premium amortized each year reduces the adjusted basis of the owner 
of the Bond for purposes of determining taxable gain or loss upon disposition.  The amount of 
original issue premium on a Bond is amortized each year over the term to maturity of the Bond 
on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date 
(with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates).  Amortized Bond premium is not 
deductible for federal income tax purposes.  Owners of premium Bonds, including purchasers 
who do not purchase in the original offering, should consult their own tax advisors with respect 
to State of California personal income tax and federal income tax consequences of owning such 
Bonds. 
 
In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is exempt from California 

personal income taxes. 

 
Owners of the Bonds should also be aware that the ownership or disposition of, or the 
accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may have federal or state tax consequences other 
than as described above.  Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any federal or state 
tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds other than as expressly described above. 

Absence of Litigation 
 

The Authority and the City will certify at the time the Bonds are issued that no litigation is 
pending  or  threatened  concerning  the  validity  of  the  Bonds  or  the  CFD  Bonds  and  that  no 
action, suit or proceeding is known by the Authority or the City to be pending that would restrain 
or  enjoin  the  delivery  of  the  Bonds  or  the  CFD  Bonds,  or  contest  or  affect  the  validity  of  the 
Bonds or the CFD Bonds, or any proceedings of the Authority or the City taken with respect to 
the Bonds or the CFD Bonds.   

Legal Opinion 
 

All proceedings in connection with the issuance of the Bonds are subject to the approval 
as  to  their  legality  of  Jones  Hall,  A  Professional  Law  Corporation,  San  Francisco,  California, 
Bond Counsel.  The unqualified opinion of Bond Counsel approving the validity of the Bonds is 
attached as APPENDIX D. 

Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, 
Inc. (“S&P”) has assigned the rating of “AA” to the Insured Bonds with the understanding that 
upon  delivery  of  the  Bonds  the  Bond  Insurance  Policy  will  be  issued  by  BAM.  S&P  has  also 
assigned an underlying rating of "A-" to the Bonds, without regard to the issuance of the Bond 
Insurance Policy, as shown on the cover page hereof.  Such ratings reflect only the view of S&P 
and an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained from S&P at: Standard & 
Poor’s Rating Services, 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041.  There is no assurance 
that such ratings will continue for any given period of time or that it will not be revised downward 
or withdrawn entirely by S&P, if in the judgment of S&P, circumstances so warrant.  Any such 
downward  revision  or  withdrawal  of  such  ratings  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  market 
price of the Bonds.  The City and the Authority assume no obligation to attempt to maintain any 
rating on the Bonds.

VERIFICATION OF MATHEMATICAL COMPUTATIONS 

 

 

Causey,  Demgen  &  Moore,  Inc.,  Certified  Public  Accountants,  Denver,  Colorado, 
independent accountants, upon delivery of the Bonds, will deliver one or more reports on the 
mathematical accuracy of certain computations contained in schedules provided to them which 
were prepared by the City relating to the sufficiency of moneys and securities deposited into the 
Escrow  Fund  to  pay,  when  due,  the  principal,  whether  at  maturity  or  upon  prior  prepayment, 
interest and prepayment premium requirements of the Prior East Franklin CFD Bonds, the Prior 
Poppy Ridge CFD Bonds and the Prior Authority Bonds.   

UNDERWRITING 

 
Piper  Jaffray  &  Co.,  Incorporated  (the  “Underwriter”),  has  agreed  to  purchase  the 
Bonds  at  a  purchase  price  of  $99,735,093.90  (being  the  principal  amount  of  the  Bonds 
($90,630,000)  plus  net  original  issue  premium  of  $9,594,495.90  and  less  an  underwriter's 
discount of $489,402.00).  

 
The  Underwriter  has  entered 

'"Distribution 
Agreement")  with  Charles  Schwab  &  Co.,  Inc.  ("CS&Co.")  for  the  retail  distribution  of  certain 
securities offerings at the original issue prices. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, CS&Co. 
will purchase Bonds from the Underwriter at the original issue price less a negotiated portion of 
the selling concession applicable to any Bonds that CS&Co. sells. 

into  a  distribution  agreement  (the 

 
The Underwriter may change the initial public offering prices of the Bonds from time to 
time.  The agreement under which the Underwriter has agreed to purchase the Bonds provides 
that the Underwriter will purchase all the Bonds if any are purchased, and that the obligation to 
make  such  purchase  is  subject  to  certain  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  therein,  including, 
among others, the approval of certain legal matters by counsel. 

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE 

 
The City, on behalf of itself and the Authority, will covenant for the benefit of owners of 
the Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data relating to the Districts (the 
“Annual  Report”)  by  not  later  than  nine  months  following  the  end  of  the  City’s  Fiscal  Year 
(currently March 31 based on the City’s Fiscal Year ending June 30), commencing March 31, 
2016, with the report for the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2015, and to provide notices of the 
occurrence of certain listed events.   

 
These covenants have been made in order to assist the Underwriter in complying with 
Securities Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12(b)(5), as amended (the “Rule”).  The specific 
nature of the information to be contained in the Annual Report or the notices of listed events is 
set forth in APPENDIX E.”  

 
In the past five years, the City and the Authority have had certain instances where filings 

pursuant previous continuing disclosure obligation under the Rule were late. 

 
The City’s $67,670,000 Community Facilities District No. 2005-1 (Laguna Ridge) Special 
Tax Bonds, Series 2007, dated July 12, 2007, require continuing disclosure operating reports to 
be filed by January 15th of each calendar year and the operating reports were all timely filed.  

62 

 

 

However the annual financial reports were filed between 29 and 44 days after the due date for 
fiscal years 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12.   

 
For the Authority's $90,875,000 Special Tax Revenue Bonds, dated September 8, 2005, 
and  the  Authority's  $15,900,000  Special  Tax  Revenue  Bonds,  Series  2006,  dated  May  25, 
2006, the operating report was filed 350 days late for fiscal year 2011-12. 

 
Regarding the Authority’s $18,585,000 Lease Revenue Bonds (2007 Capital Projects), 
Series 2007, dated June 20, 2007, the  rating was upgraded from A to an A+ on October 22, 
2010.  The  Authority  was  over  four  years  late  in  filing  the  material  event  notice  regarding  the 
upgrade but has remedied this issue.   

 
The  City  and  the  Authority  have  had  no  other  instances  in  the  previous  five  years  in 
which  they  failed  to  comply  in  all  material  respects  with  any  previous  continuing  disclosure 
obligation. The City and the Authority have engaged NBS to serve as dissemination agent for its 
undertakings pursuant to the Rule with respect to the Bonds.

the Fiscal Agent Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in the Fiscal Agent Agreement will 
permit, or be construed as permitting, (a) an extension of the maturity date of the principal, or 
the  payment  date  of  interest  on,  any  Bond,  (b)  a  reduction  in  the  principal  amount  of,  or 
redemption premium on, any Bond or the rate of interest thereon, (c) a preference or priority of 
any  Bond  over  any  other  Bond,  or  (d)  a  reduction  in  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the 
Bonds the Owners of which are required to consent to such Supplemental Agreement, without 
the consent of the Owners of all Bonds then Outstanding. 

 
If at any time the City will desire to adopt a Supplemental Agreement, which pursuant to 
the terms of the Fiscal Agent Agreement will require the consent of the Bondowners, the City 
will  so  notify  the  Fiscal  Agent  and  will  deliver  to  the  Fiscal  Agent  a  copy  of  the  proposed 
Supplemental Agreement.  The Fiscal Agent will, at the expense of the City, cause notice of the 
proposed  Supplemental  Agreement  to  be  mailed,  by  first  class  mail,  postage  prepaid,  to  all 
Bondowners at their addresses as they appear in the Bond Register.  Such notice will briefly set 
forth the nature of the proposed Supplemental Agreement and will state that a copy thereof is 
on  file  at  the  office  of  the  Fiscal  Agent  for  inspection  by  all  Bondowners.    The  failure  of  any 
Bondowners to receive such notice will not affect the validity of such Supplemental Agreement 
when  consented  to  and  approved  by  the  Owners  of  not  less  than  a  majority  in  aggregate 
principal  amount  of  the  Bonds  Outstanding  as  required  by  the  Fiscal  Agent  Agreement.  
Whenever at any time within one year after the date of the first mailing of such notice, the Fiscal 
Agent will receive an instrument or instruments purporting to be executed by the Owners of not 
less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding, which instrument 
or instruments will refer to the proposed Supplemental Agreement described in such notice, and 
will specifically consent to and approve the adoption thereof by the City substantially in the form 
of  the  copy  referred  to  in  such  notice  as  on  file  with  the  Fiscal  Agent,  such  proposed 
Supplemental Agreement, when duly adopted by the City, will thereafter become a part of the 
proceedings for the issuance of the Bonds.  In determining whether the Owners of a majority of 
the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Bonds  have  consented  to  the  adoption  of  any 
Supplemental  Agreement,  Bonds  which  are  owned  by  the  City  or  by  any  person  directly  or 
indirectly controlling or controlled by or under the direct or indirect common control with the City, 
will be disregarded and will be treated as though they were not Outstanding for the purpose of 
any such determination. 

 
Upon  the  adoption  of  any  Supplemental  Agreement  and  the  receipt  of  consent  to any 
such  Supplemental  Agreement  from  the  Owners  of  not  less  than  a  majority  in  aggregate 
principal  amount  of  the  Outstanding  Bonds  in  instances  where  such  consent  is  required 
pursuant to the provisions of the Fiscal Agent Agreement, the Fiscal Agent Agreement will be, 
and will be deemed to be, modified and amended in accordance therewith, and the respective 
rights, duties and obligations under the Fiscal Agent Agreement of the City and all Owners of 
Outstanding Bonds will thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder, subject in 
all respects to such modifications and amendments. 

 
Defeasance 

If the City will pay or cause to be paid, or there will otherwise be paid, to the Owner of an 
Outstanding  Bond  the  interest  due  thereon  and  the  principal  thereof,  at  the  times  and  in  the 
manner  stipulated  in  the  Fiscal  Agent  Agreement  or  any  Supplemental  Agreement,  then  the 
Owner of such Bond will cease to be entitled to the pledge of Net Taxes, and, other than as set 
forth below, all covenants, agreements and other obligations of the City to the Owner of such 

A-6 

 

Bond  under  the  Fiscal  Agent  Agreement  and  any  Supplemental  Agreement  relating  to  such 
Parity Bond will thereupon cease, terminate and become void and be discharged and satisfied.  
In the event of a defeasance of all Outstanding Bonds pursuant to the Fiscal Agent Agreement, 
the Fiscal Agent will execute and deliver to the City all such instruments as may be desirable to 
evidence such discharge and satisfaction, and the Fiscal Agent will pay over or deliver to the 
City’s general fund all money or securities held by it pursuant to the  Fiscal Agent Agreement 
which are not required for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on 
such Bonds. 

 
Any Outstanding Bond will be deemed to have been paid within the meaning expressed 
in the first paragraph of the Fiscal Agent Agreement if such Bond is paid in any one or more of 
the following ways: 

 

(a)    by paying or causing to be paid the principal of, premium, if any, and interest 

on such Bond, as and when the same become due and payable; 

 
(b)   by  depositing  with  the  Fiscal  Agent,  in  trust,  at  or  before  maturity,  money 
which, together with the amounts then on deposit in the Special Tax Fund and available 
for such purpose, is fully sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest 
on such Bond, as and when the same will become due and payable; or 

 
(c)   by depositing with the Fiscal Agent or another escrow bank appointed by the 
City, in trust, Federal Securities, in which the City may lawfully invest its money, in such 
amount  as  will  be  sufficient,  together  with  the  interest  to  accrue  thereon  and  moneys 
then on deposit in the Special Tax Fund and available for such purpose, together with 
the interest to accrue thereon, to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and 
interest on such Bond, as and when the same will become due and payable; 
 
then, at the election of the City, and notwithstanding that any Outstanding Bonds will not 
have  been  surrendered  for  payment,  all  obligations  of  the  City  under  the  Fiscal  Agent 
Agreement  and  any  Supplemental  Agreement  with  respect  to  such  Bond  will  cease  and 
terminate, except for the obligation of the Fiscal Agent to pay or cause to be paid to the Owners 
of any such Bond not so surrendered and paid, all sums due thereon.  Notice of such election 
will be filed with the Fiscal Agent not fewer than ten days prior to the proposed defeasance date, 
or such shorter period of time as may be acceptable to the Fiscal Agent.  In connection with a 
defeasance under (b) or (c) above, there will be provided to the City a verification report from an 
independent  nationally  recognized  certified  public  accountant  stating  its  opinion  as  to  the 
sufficiency of the moneys or securities deposited with the Fiscal Agent or the escrow bank to 
pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all Outstanding Bonds to be 
defeased in accordance with the Fiscal Agent Agreement, as and when the same will become 
due  and  payable,  and  an  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel  (which  may  rely  upon  the  opinion  of  the 
certified  public  accountant)  to  the  effect  that  the  Bonds  being  defeased  have  been  legally 
defeased  in  accordance  with  the  Fiscal  Agent  Agreement  and  any  applicable  Supplemental 
Agreement. 

 
Upon a defeasance, the Fiscal Agent, upon request of the City, will release the rights of 
the Owners of such Bonds which have been defeased under the Fiscal Agent Agreement and 
any Supplemental Agreement and execute and deliver to the City all such instruments as may 
be desirable to evidence such release, discharge and satisfaction.  In the case of a defeasance 
hereunder  of  all  Outstanding  Bonds,  the  Fiscal  Agent  will  pay  over  or  deliver  to  the  City  any 
funds  held  by  the  Fiscal  Agent  at  the  time  of  a  defeasance,  which  are  not  required  for  the 

A-7 

 

purpose  of  paying  and  discharging  the  principal  of  or  interest  on  the  Bonds  when  due.    The 
Fiscal Agent will, at the written direction of the City, mail, first class, postage prepaid, a notice to 
the Bondowners whose Bonds have been defeased, in the form directed by the City, stating that 
the defeasance has occurred. 

 
Defeasance will be accomplished only with an irrevocable deposit in escrow of certain 
investments  referred  to  above.    Further  substitutions  of  securities  in  the  escrow  are  not 
permitted.    The  deposit  in  the  escrow  must  be  sufficient,  without  reinvestment,  to  pay  all 
principal and interest as scheduled on the Bonds to and including the date of redemption. Any 
security used for defeasance must provide for the timely payment of principal and interest and 
cannot  be  callable  or  prepayable  prior  to  maturity  or  earlier  redemption  of  the  rated  debt 
(excluding securities that do not have a fixed par value and/or whose terms do not promise a 
fixed dollar amount at maturity or call date). 

 
Conditions for the Issuance of Parity Bonds and Other Additional Indebtedness.   

The City may at any time after the issuance and delivery of the Bonds hereunder issue 
Parity Bonds payable from the Net Taxes and other amounts deposited in the Special Tax Fund 
and secured by a lien and charge upon such amounts equal to the lien and charge securing the 
Outstanding  Bonds  and  any  other  Parity  Bonds  theretofore  issued  hereunder  or  under  any 
Supplemental  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that  Parity  Bonds  may  only  be  issued  for  the

issuance of such Parity Bonds;

have been duly and lawfully adopted by the City, are in full force and effect and 
are  valid  and  binding  upon  the  City  and  enforceable  in  accordance  with  their 
terms  (except  as  enforcement  may  be  limited  by  bankruptcy,  insolvency, 
reorganization  and  other  similar  laws  relating  to  the  enforcement  of  creditors’ 
rights); (b) the Fiscal Agent Agreement creates the valid pledge which it purports

date of the adoption of the Supplemental Agreement authorizing the issuance of 
such additional Parity Bonds (based on either the assessed valuations thereof as 
contained in the most recent equalized assessment roll of Sacramento County or 
an MAI appraisal), will be equal to at least twenty (20) times the sum of (i) the 
aggregate principal amount of all Bonds to be outstanding after the issuance of 
such  Parity  Bonds,  plus  (ii) the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  all  outstanding 
special assessment bonds that are payable from special assessments levied on 
the Taxable Property, plus (iii) the proportion of the aggregate principal amount

Special Taxes that may be levied in each Fiscal Year following issuance of the 
additional Parity Bonds by application of the Rate and Method of Apportionment 
on  Developed  Property  will  be  no  less  than  110%  of  Maximum  Annual  Debt 
Service with respect to the Bonds to be Outstanding. 

(3)  Reserve  Account.    The  balance  in  the  Reserve  Account,  upon  the 
receipt  of  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  such  Parity  Bonds,  will  be  increased,  if

Establishment and Application of Funds 

The Indenture establishes the Proceeds Fund, the Revenue Fund, the Interest Fund, the 
Principal Fund, the Redemption Fund, and the Rebate Fund, all of which are to be held by the 
Trustee. 

Purchase  Fund.    The  Trustee  will  transfer  to  the  Fiscal  Agent  all  of  the  proceeds 
received  from  the  sale  of  the  Bonds  and  deposited  in  the  Purchase  Fund  in  payment  of  the 
purchase price of the CFD Bonds. 

Revenue Fund.  The Trustee will deposit all Revenues, as and when received, into the 
Revenue Fund.  The Trustee will transfer from the Revenue Fund and deposit in the following 
respective funds the following amounts on the dates described.   

 

(a)  On each Interest Payment Date and date for redemption of the Bonds, the 
Trustee will transfer from the Revenue Fund, and deposit into the following respective 
accounts  for  the  Bonds,  the  following  amounts  in  the  following  order  of  priority,  the 
requirements of each such account (including the making up of any deficiencies in any 
such  account  resulting  from  lack  of  Revenues  sufficient  to  make  any  earlier  required 
deposit) at the time of deposit to be satisfied before any transfer is made to any account 
subsequent in priority: 

 
(i)  Interest Account.  On each Interest Payment Date and redemption date, the 
Trustee  will  deposit  in  the  Interest  Account  an  amount  required  to  cause  the 
aggregate  amount  on  deposit  in  the  Interest  Account  to  equal  the  amount  of 
interest  becoming  due  and  payable  on  such  Interest  Payment  Date  on  all 
Outstanding Bonds or to be paid on the Bonds being redeemed on such date.  
No  deposit  need  be  made  into  the  Interest  Account  if  the  amount  contained 
therein  is  at  least  equal  to  the  interest  becoming  due  and  payable  upon  all 
Outstanding Bonds on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or redemption 
date,  as  applicable.    All  moneys  in  the  Interest  Account  will  be  used  and 
withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of paying interest on the Bonds 
as  it  will  become  due  and  payable  (including  accrued  interest  on  any  Bonds 
redeemed  prior  to  maturity).    In  the  event  that  the  amounts  on  deposit  in  the 
Interest  Account  on  any  Interest  Payment  Date  or  redemption  date  are 
insufficient for any reason to pay the aggregate amount of interest then coming 
due and payable on the Outstanding Bonds, the Trustee will apply such amounts 
to the payment of interest on each of the Outstanding Bonds on a pro rata basis. 
 
(ii)  Principal Account.  On each Interest Payment Date and redemption date on 
which the principal of the Bonds will be payable, the Trustee will deposit in the 
Principal Account an amount required to cause the aggregate amount on deposit 
in the Principal Account to equal the principal amount of, and premium (if any) 
on,  the  Bonds  coming  due  and  payable  on  such  Interest  Payment  Date,  or 
required  to  be  redeemed  on  such  date  pursuant  to  the  Indenture;  provided, 
however,  that  no  amount  will  be  deposited  to  effect  an  optional  redemption 
unless the Trustee has first received a certificate of an Independent Accountant 
certifying that such deposit to effect an optional redemption of the Bonds will not 
impair the ability of the Authority to make timely payment of the principal of and 
interest  on  the  Bonds,  assuming  for  such  purposes  that  the  City  continues  to 
make timely payments on all CFD Bonds not then in default.  All moneys in the 
Principal  Account  will  be  used  and  withdrawn  by  the  Trustee  solely  for  the 

A-13 

 

purpose  of  (i)  paying  the  principal  of  the  Bonds  at  the  maturity  thereof  or  (ii) 
paying the principal of and premium (if any) on any Bonds upon the redemption 
thereof. 
 
(b)  If on any Interest Payment Date or date for redemption the amount on deposit 
in  the  Revenue  Fund  is  inadequate  to  make  the  transfers  described  in  subsection  (a) 
above as a result of a payment default on an issue of CFD Bonds, the Trustee will notify 
the  City  of  the  amount  needed  to  make  the  required  deposits  under  subsection  (a) 
above.  In the event that within 5 Business Days of delivering such notice the Trustee 
receives additional payments from the City to cure such shortfall, the Trustee will deposit 
such amounts to the account designated in writing by the City. 

 
(c)  On  each  Interest  Payment  Date  after  making  the  transfers  required  under 
subsections (a) and (b) above, upon receipt of a Request of the Authority to do so, the 
Trustee will transfer from the Revenue Fund to the Rebate Fund for deposit therein the 
amounts specified in such Request. 

 
(d)  On  September  2  of  each  year,  after  making  the  deposits  described  under 
subsections  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  above,  the  Trustee  will  transfer  all  amounts  remaining  on 
deposit in the Revenue Fund to the Surplus Fund. 
 
Rebate  Fund.  The  Trustee  will  establish  a  Rebate  Fund.  Absent  an  opinion  of  Bond 
Counsel that the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on the 
Bonds  will  not  be  adversely  affected,  the  Authority  will  cause  to  be  deposited  in  the  Rebate 
Fund  such  amounts  as  are  required  to  be  deposited  therein  pursuant  to  the  Fiscal  Agent 
Agreement, the Indenture and the Code.  All money at any time deposited in the Rebate Fund 
will be held by the Trustee in trust for payment to the United States Treasury in accordance with 
written  instructions  given  by  the  Authority  to  the  Trustee,  upon  which  the  Trustee  may 
conclusively rely. Any funds remaining in the Rebate Fund after redemption and payment of the 
Bonds  and  after  payment  of  all  the  amounts  payable  to  the  United  States  Treasury  from  the 
Rebate Fund, including accrued interest and payment of all applicable fees to the Trustee, may 
be  withdrawn  by  the  Trustee  and  remitted  to  the  Authority  and  utilized  in  any  manner  by  the 
Authority. 

 
Payment Procedure Under the Bond Insurance Policy.   
 
In the event that principal and/or interest due on the Insured Bonds will be paid by the 
Insurer pursuant to the Bond Insurance Policy, the Insured Bonds will remain Outstanding for all 
purposes, not be defeased or otherwise satisfied and not be considered paid by the Authority, 
the  assignment  and  pledge  of  the  trust  estate  and  all  covenants,  agreements  and  other 
obligations  of  the  Authority  to  the  registered  owners  will  continue  to  exist  and  will  run  to  the 
benefit of the Insurer, and the Insurer will be subrogated to the rights of such registered owners 
including, without limitation, any rights that such owners may have in respect of securities law 
violations arising from the offer and sale of the Insured Bonds. 

 
In the event that on the second Business Day prior to any payment date on the Insured 
Bonds, the Trustee has not received sufficient moneys to pay all principal of and interest on the 
Insured Bonds due on such payment date, the Trustee will immediately notify the Insurer or its 
designee  on  the  same  Business  Day  by  telephone  or  electronic  mail,  of  the  amount  of  the 
deficiency. If any deficiency is made up in whole or in part prior to or on the payment date, the 
Trustee will so notify the Insurer or its designee. In addition, if the Trustee has notice that any 

A-14 

holder of the Insured Bonds has been required to disgorge payments of principal of or interest 
on  the  Insured  Bonds  pursuant  to  a  final,  non-appealable  order  by  a  court  of  competent 
jurisdiction  that  such  payment  constitutes  an  avoidable  preference  to  such  holder  within  the 
meaning  of  any  applicable  bankruptcy  law,  then  the  Trustee  will  notify  the  Insurer  or  its 
designee of such fact by telephone or electronic mail, or by overnight or other delivery service 
as to which a delivery receipt is signed by a person authorized to accept delivery on behalf of 
the Insurer. 

 
The Trustee will irrevocably be designated, appointed, directed and authorized to act as 

attorney-in-fact for holders of the Insured Bonds as follows: 

If there is a deficiency in amounts required to pay interest and/or principal 
on the Insured Bonds, the Trustee will (i) execute and deliver to the Insurer, 
in form satisfactory to the Insurer, an instrument appointing the Insurer as 
agent  and  attorney-in-fact  for  such  holders  of  the  Insured  Bonds  in  any 
legal proceeding related to the payment and assignment to the Insurer of 
the claims for interest on the Insured Bonds, (ii) receive as designee of the 
respective holders (and not as Paying Agent) in accordance with the tenor 
of the Bond Insurance Policy payment from the Insurer with respect to the 
claims  for  interest  so  assigned,  and  (iii)  disburse  the  same  to  such 
respective holders; and 

If there is a deficiency in amounts required to pay principal of the Insured 
Bonds,  the  Trustee  will  (i)  execute  and  deliver  to  the  Insurer,  in  form 
satisfactory  to  the  Insurer,  an  instrument  appointing  the  Insurer  as  agent 
and  attorney-in-fact  for  such  holder  of  the  Insured  Bonds  in  any  legal 
proceeding related to the payment of such principal and an assignment to 
the Insurer of the Insured Bonds surrendered to the Insurer, (ii) receive as 
designee  of  the  respective  holders  (and  not  as  Paying  Agent)  in 
accordance with the tenor of the Bond Insurance Policy payment therefore 
from the Insurer, and (iii) disburse the same to such holders.  The Trustee 
will  designate  any  portion  of  payment  of  principal  on  Bonds  paid  by  the 
Insurer, whether by virtue of mandatory sinking fund redemption, maturity 
or  other  advancement  of  maturity,  on  its  books  as  a  reduction  in  the 
principal  amount  of  Bonds  registered  to  the  then  current  holder,  whether 
DTC or its nominee or otherwise, and will issue a replacement Bond to the 
Insurer,  registered  in  the  name  directed  by  the  Insurer,  in  a  principal 
amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  principal  so  paid  (without  regard  to 
authorized  denominations);  provided  that  the  Trustee's  failure  to  so 
designate any payment or issue any replacement Bond will have no effect 
on the amount of principal or interest payable by the Authority on any Bond 
or the subrogation or assignment rights of the Insurer. 

 

 
(a) 

 
(b) 

 
Payments with respect to claims for interest on and principal of Bonds disbursed by the 
Trustee  from  proceeds  of  the  Bond  Insurance  Policy  will  not  be  considered  to  discharge  the 
obligation of the Authority with respect to such Bonds, and the Insurer will become the owner of 
such unpaid Bonds and claims for the interest in accordance with the tenor of the assignment 
made to it under the provisions of the preceding paragraphs or otherwise. 

 
Irrespective  of  whether  any  such  assignment  is  executed  and  delivered,  the  Authority 

and the Trustee agree for the benefit of the Insurer that: 

A-15 

 

 

 
(a)  They recognize that to the extent the Insurer makes payments directly or 
indirectly (e.g., by paying through the Trustee), on account of principal of or 
interest on the Insured Bonds, the Insurer will be subrogated to the rights of 
such holders to receive the amount of such principal and interest from the 
Authority,  with  interest  thereon,  as  provided  and  solely  from  the  sources 
stated in the transaction documents and the Insured Bonds; and 

 
(b)  They will accordingly pay to the Insurer the amount of such principal and 
interest, with interest thereon as provided in the transaction documents and 
the Insured Bonds, but only from the sources and in the manner provided 
therein for the payment of principal of and interest on the Insured Bonds to 
holders, and will otherwise treat the Insurer as the owner of such rights to 
the amount of such principal and interest. 

 
Investment of Funds  

All moneys in any of the funds or accounts established with the Trustee pursuant to the 
Indenture will be invested by the Trustee solely in Permitted Investments, as directed pursuant 
to the Request of the Authority filed with the Trustee at least two (2) Business Days in advance 
of the making of such investments.  

 
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost, or Stolen Bonds.   

If any Bond will become mutilated, the Authority, at the expense of the Owner of said 
Bond, will execute, and the Trustee will thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like 
Series,  tenor  and  authorized  denomination  in  exchange  and  substitution  for  the  Bond  so 
mutilated,  but  only  upon  surrender  to  the  Trustee  of  the  Bond  so  mutilated.    Every  mutilated 
Bond so surrendered to the Trustee will be cancelled by it and destroyed in accordance with the 
retention  policy  of  the  Trustee  then  in  effect.    If  any  Bond  issued  hereunder  will  be  lost, 
destroyed or stolen, evidence of such loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the Trustee 
and, if such evidence be satisfactory to it and indemnity satisfactory to it will be given, at the 
expense  of  the  Bond  Owner,  the  Authority  will  execute,  and  the  Trustee  will  thereupon 
authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like series and tenor in lieu of and in substitution for the 
Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen (or if any such Bond will have matured or will have been called 
for  redemption,  instead  of  issuing  a  substitute  Bond  the  Trustee  may  pay  the  same  without 
surrender  thereof  upon  receipt  of  indemnity  satisfactory  to  the  Trustee).    The  Trustee  may 
require payment of a reasonable fee for each new Bond issued as described in this paragraph 
and of the expenses which may be incurred by the Authority and the Trustee.  Any Bond issued 
as described in this paragraph in lieu of any Bond alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen will 
constitute an original contractual obligation on the part of the Authority whether or not the Bond 
alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen be at any time enforceable by anyone, and will be equally 
and proportionately entitled to the benefits of the Indenture with all other Bonds secured by the 
Indenture. 

A-16 

 

Events of Default; Remedies of Owners 

Events of Default.  The following events will be Events of Default: 

(a)  Default in the due and punctual payment of the principal of any Bond when 
and  as  the  same  will  become  due  and  payable,  whether  at  maturity  as  therein 
expressed, by proceedings for redemption, by declaration or otherwise. 

 
(b)  Default in the due and punctual payment of any installment of interest on any 

Bond when and as such interest installment will become due and payable. 

 
(c)  Default  by  the  Authority  in  the  observance  of  any  of  the  other  covenants, 
agreements or conditions on its part in the Indenture or in the Bonds contained, if such 
default  will  have  continued  for  a  period  of  sixty  (60)  days  after  written  notice  thereof, 
specifying such default and requiring the same to be remedied, will have been given to 
the Authority by the Trustee, or to the Authority and the Trustee by the Owners of not 
less than twenty five percent (25%) in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the 
time  Outstanding;  provided  that  such  default  (other  than  a  default  arising  from 
nonpayment of the Trustee’s fees and expenses, which must be cured within such 60 
day  period  unless  waived  by  the  Trustee)  will  not  constitute  an  Event  of  Default 
hereunder if the Authority will commence to cure such default within said sixty (60) day 
period  and  thereafter  diligently  and  in  good  faith  will  cure  such  default  within  a 
reasonable period of time; or 

 
(d)  Default under the CFD  2002-1 Fiscal Agent Agreement or  the CFD 2003-1 

Fiscal Agent Agreement. 
 
Remedies.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee may pursue any 
available remedy at law or in equity to enforce the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, 
and interest on the Outstanding Bonds, and to enforce any rights of the Trustee under or with 
respect to the Indenture.  In the event of an Event of Default arising out of a nonpayment of 
Trustee’s fees and expenses, the Trustee may sue the Authority to seek recovery of its fees and 
expenses; provided, however, that such recovery may be made only from Revenues. 

 
If an Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing and if requested to do so by 
the Owners of at least twenty five percent (25%) in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding 
Bonds,  and,  in  each  case,  if  indemnified  as  provided  in  the  Indenture,  the  Trustee  will  be 
obligated to exercise such one or more of the rights and powers conferred by the Indenture and, 
as applicable, under the CFD Bonds, as the Trustee, being advised by counsel, will deem most 
expedient in the interests of the Bond Owners. 

 
No remedy by the terms of the Indenture conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee (or 
to the Bond Owners) is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but each and every such 
remedy will be cumulative and will be in addition to any other remedy given to the Trustee or to 
the Bond Owners hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. 

 
No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default 
will  impair  any  such  right  or  power  or  will  be  construed  to  be  a  waiver  of  any  such  Event  of 
Default  or  acquiescence  therein;  such  right  or  power  may  be  exercised  from  time  to  time  as 
often as may be deemed expedient. 

 

A-17 

 

Anything  in  the  Indenture  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,  upon  the  occurrence  and 
continuance of a default or an event of default, the Insurer will be entitled to control and direct 
the enforcement of all rights and remedies granted to the holders of the Insured Bonds or the 
Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Insured Bonds under the Indenture. The Trustee 
may not waive any default or event of default without the Insurer’s written consent. 

 
Application of Revenues and Other Funds After Event of Default.  All amounts received 
by  the  Trustee  with  respect  to  the  Bonds  pursuant  to  any  right  given  or  action  taken  by  the 
Trustee  under  the  provisions  of  the  Indenture  relating  to  the  Bonds  will  be  applied  by  the 
Trustee in the following order upon presentation of the several Bonds, and the stamping thereon 
of the amount of the payment if only partially paid, or upon the surrender thereof if fully paid – 

 
First, to the payment of the fees, costs and expenses of the Trustee in declaring such 
Event of Default and in carrying out the provisions of the Indenture relating to Events of Default, 
including  reasonable  compensation  to  its  agents,  attorneys  and  counsel  (including  outside 
counsel  and  the  allocated  costs  of  internal  attorneys),  and  to  the  payment  of  all  other 
outstanding fees and expenses of the Trustee; and 

 
Second, to the payment of the whole amount of interest on and principal of the Bonds 
then due and unpaid, with interest on overdue installments of principal and interest to the extent 
permitted  by  law  at  the  net  effective  rate  of  interest  then  borne  by  the  Outstanding  Bonds; 
provided,  however,  that  in  the  event  such  amounts  will  be  insufficient  to  pay  in  full  the  full 
amount of such interest and principal, then such amounts will be applied in the following order of 
priority: 
 

(a)  first to the payment of all installments of interest on the Bonds then due and 

unpaid, 
 
(b)  second, to the payment of all installments of principal of the Bonds then due 

third,  to  the  payment  of  interest  on  overdue  installments  of  principal  and 

and unpaid, and 

 
(c) 

interest on Bonds. 
 
Modification or Amendment of the Indenture 

 The Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Authority and of the Owners of the 
Bonds may, with prior written notice to Standard & Poor’s, be modified or amended at any time 
by a Supplemental Indenture which will become binding when the prior written consent of the 
Insurer  and  the  Owners  of  a  majority  in  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Bonds  then 
Outstanding are filed with the Trustee.  No such modification or amendment will (a) extend the 
maturity of or reduce the interest rate on any Bond or otherwise alter or impair the obligation of 
the Authority to pay the principal, interest or redemption premiums at the time and place and at 
the rate and in the currency provided therein of any Bond without the express written consent of 
the Owner of such Bond, (b) reduce the percentage of Bonds required for the written consent to 
any such amendment or modification, or (c) without written consent of the Trustee, modify any 
of the rights or obligations of the Trustee. 

 
The Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Authority and of the Owners of the 
Bonds may, with prior written notice to Standard & Poor’s, also be modified or amended at any 
time by a Supplemental Indenture which will become binding upon adoption, without consent of 

A-18 

 

any Bond Owners, to the extent permitted by law but only for any one or more of the following 
purposes:  

(a)  to  add  to  the  covenants  and  agreements  of  the  Authority  contained  in  the 
Indenture,  other  covenants  and  agreements  thereafter  to  be  observed,  or  to  limit  or 
surrender any rights or powers reserved to or conferred upon the Authority so long as 
such  addition,  limitation  or  surrender  of  such  rights  or  powers  will  not  materially 
adversely affect the Owners of the Bonds; or 

 
(b)  to  make  such  provisions  for  the  purpose  of  curing  any  ambiguity,  or  of 
curing, correcting or supplementing any defective provision contained in the Indenture, 
or in any other respect whatsoever as the Authority may deem necessary or desirable, 
provided  under  any  circumstances  that  such  modifications  or  amendments  will  not 
materially adversely affect the interests of the Owners of the Bonds; or 

to  amend  any  provision  relating  to  the  Code  as  may  be  necessary  or 
appropriate to assure compliance with the Code and the exclusion from gross income of 
interest on the Bonds; or 

 
(d)  to amend any provision to place any Additional Bonds on a parity with the 
Bonds for all purposes of the Indenture, including, but not limited to, for the purpose of 
exercising all rights and remedies hereunder; or 

 
(c) 

 
(e)  to amend the provisions relating to the Surplus Fund. 
 

At least 15 days in advance of the execution of any amendment to the Indenture, the 
Trustee will mail notice of such amendment and a copy of the proposed text of such amendment 
to Standard & Poor’s.  

 
The  Trustee  will  be  furnished  with  an  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel  that  any  such 
Supplemental  Indenture  entered  into  by  the  Authority  and  the  Trustee  complies  with  the 
provisions described above and the Trustee may conclusively rely upon such opinion and will be 
fully protected in relying thereon. 

 
Defeasance 

Discharge  of  Indenture.    If  the  Authority  will  pay  and  discharge  any  or  all  of  the 

Outstanding Bonds in any one or more of the following ways: 

(a)  by well and truly paying or causing to be paid the principal of and interest 
and premium (if any) on such Bonds, as and when the same become due and payable;  

 
(b)  by  irrevocably  depositing  with  the  Trustee,  in  trust,  at  or  before  maturity, 
money  which,  together  with  the  available  amounts  then  on  deposit  in  the  funds  and 
accounts established with the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture and available for such 
purpose,  is  fully  sufficient  to  pay  such  Bonds,  including  all  principal,  interest  and 
redemption premiums; or 

 
(c)  by  irrevocably  depositing  with  the  Trustee  or  any  other  fiduciary,  in  trust, 
Federal  Securities  in  such  amount  as  an  Independent  Accountant  determines  will, 
together with the interest to accrue thereon and available moneys then on deposit in the 

 

 

A-19 

 

funds and accounts established with the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture and available 
for  such  purpose,  be  fully  sufficient  to  pay  and  discharge  the  indebtedness  on  such 
Bonds  (including  all  principal,  interest  and  redemption  premiums)  at  or  before  their 
respective maturity dates; 
 
then  any  such  Outstanding  Bond  or  Bonds  will  be  deemed  to  have  been  paid  and 
discharged;  provided,  however,  that  any  such  Outstanding  Bond  or  Bonds  will  be  deemed  to 
have been paid under paragraph (c) above only if (i) in the case of Bonds to be redeemed prior 
to  the  maturity  thereof,  notice  of  such  redemption  will  have  been  mailed  pursuant  to  the 
Indenture or provision satisfactory to the Trustee will have been made for the mailing of such 
notice, (ii) a verification report of an Independent Accountant will be delivered to the Trustee, 
and (iii) an opinion of Bond Counsel will be delivered to the Trustee in the case of a defeasance 
of Bonds, to the effect that the requirements of the Indenture have been satisfied with respect to 
such discharge of such Bonds.  Upon a discharge of one or more Bonds as described above, 
and notwithstanding that any of such Bonds will not have been surrendered for payment, the 
pledge  of  the  Revenues,  and  other  funds  provided  for  in  the  Indenture  with  respect  to  such 
Bonds, and all other pecuniary obligations of the Authority under the Indenture with respect to 
such Bonds, as applicable, will cease and terminate, except only the obligation of the Authority 
to  comply  with  the  covenants  contained  in  the  Indenture,  to  pay  or  cause  to  be  paid  to  the 
Owners  of  such  Bonds  not  so  surrendered  and  paid  all  sums  due  thereon  from  amounts  set 
aside for such purpose, to pay all expenses and costs of the Trustee and to comply with the 
covenants contained in the Indenture.  Any funds thereafter held by the Trustee, which are not 
required for said purposes, will be paid over to the Authority or upon a Request of the Authority 
to the City. 

 
Defeasance will be accomplished only with an irrevocable deposit in escrow of certain 
investments  referred  to  above.    Further  substitutions  of  securities  in  the  escrow  are  not 
permitted.    The  deposit  in  the  escrow  must  be  sufficient,  without  reinvestment,  to  pay  all 
principal and interest as scheduled on the Bonds to and including the date of redemption. Any 
security used for defeasance must provide for the timely payment of principal and interest and 
cannot  be  callable  or  prepayable  prior  to  maturity  or  earlier  redemption  of  the  rated  debt 
(excluding securities that do not have a fixed par value and/or whose terms do not promise a 
fixed dollar amount at maturity or call date). 

 
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  that  the  principal,  interest  and  premium  (if 
any) on by the Bonds are paid by the Insurer under the Bond Insurance Policy, the obligations 
of the Trustee and the Authority will continue in full force and effect and the Insurer will be fully 
subrogated to the rights of all Owners of the Bonds so paid.  In addition, the obligations of the 
Trustee  and  the  Authority  hereunder  shall  continue  in  full  force  and  effect,  and  shall  not  be 
terminated, until such time as the Authority shall have paid all amounts (if any) as shall be due 
and owing to the Insurer under the Bond Insurance Policy; and the Trustee will not distribute 
any funds to the Authority under the preceding paragraph unless the Authority certifies to the 
Trustee  that  there  are  no  obligations  then  due  and  owing  to  the  Insurer  under  the  Bond 
Insurance Policy. 

 
Third Party Beneficiary 
 
The Insurer is recognized as and will be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of the 

Indenture and may enforce the provisions of the Indenture as if it were a party thereto.

Effective Buying Income 
 

"Effective Buying Income" is defined as personal income less personal tax and nontax 
payments, a number often referred to as "disposable" or "after-tax" income.  Personal income is 
the  aggregate  of  wages  and  salaries,  other  labor-related  income  (such  as  employer 
contributions  to  private  pension  funds),  proprietor’s  income,  rental  income  (which  includes 
imputed  rental  income  of  owner-occupants  of  non-farm  dwellings),  dividends  paid  by 
corporations, interest income from  all sources, and transfer payments  (such as pensions and 
welfare  assistance).    Deducted  from  this  total  are  personal  taxes  (federal,  state  and  local), 
nontax  payments  (fines,  fees,  penalties,  etc.)  and  personal  contributions  to  social  insurance.  
According  to  U.S.  government  definitions,  the  resultant  figure  is  commonly  known  as 
"disposable personal income." 

 
The  following  table  summarizes  the  total  effective  buying  income  for  the  City,  the 

County, the State and the United States for the period 2010 through 2014.

D. 

METHOD OF APPORTIONMENT OF THE SPECIAL TAX 

Commencing with Fiscal  Year 2003-04, and  for each  following Fiscal  Year, the Council  shall levy  the 
Special Tax until  the  amount of the  Special Tax  levied equals the Special  Tax Requirement.  The  Special  Tax 
shall  be levied each  Fiscal  Year as follows: 

First:  The  Special  Tax  shall  be levied  on  each  Assessor's  Parcel  of Developed  Property  at  100% of 

the applicable Maximum  Special Tax; 

Second:  If additional monies are needed to satisfy the Special Tax Requirement after the first  step has 
been  completed,  the  Special  Tax  shall  be  levied  Proportionately  on  each  Assessor's  Parcel  of Final  Map 
Residential  Property  at  up  to  100%  of the  Maximum  Special  Tax  for  Final  Map  Residential  Property. 
However,  under no circumstances shall Special Taxes be levied under this second step to pay  for  Public Safety 
Costs; 

Third:  If additional monies are needed  to satisfy the Special Tax Requirement after the first two steps 
have  been  completed,  the Special  Tax  shall  be  levied  Proportionately on  each  Assessor's  Parcel  of Large  Lot 
Property  at  up  to  100%  of  the  Maximum  Special  Tax  for  Large  Lot  Property.  However,  under  no 
circumstances shaJJ  Special Taxes be levied under this third step to pay for Public Safety Costs; 

Fourth:  lf additional  monies  are  needed  to  satisfy  the  Special  Tax  Requirement  after the  first  three 
steps  have  been completed, then the Special  Tax  shall  be  levied  Proportionately  on each Assessor's Parcel  of 
Tentative  Map  Property  at  up  to  I 00% of the  Maximum  Special  Tax  for Tentative  Map  Property.  However, 
under no circumstances shall Special Taxes be levied under this fourth step to pay  for P..1blic Safety Costs; and; 

C-2-5Fifth:  If additional monies are needed to satisfy the Special Tax Requirement after the first  four steps 
have been completed, then the Special Tax shall be  levied Proportionately on each Assessor's Parcel of Other 
Taxable Property at up to  100% of the Maximum Special Tax for Other Taxable Property.  However, under no 
circumstances shall Special Taxes be levied under this fifth  step to pay for Public Safety Costs. 

Notwithstanding the above the Council may, in  any Fiscal  Year,  levy  Proportionately less than  100% 
of the Maximum  Special Tax in  step one of Section D (above),  when  (i) the  Council  is  no  longer required  to 
levy  a Special Tax pursuant to steps two through five  above in  order to meet the Special Tax Requirement; (ii) 
all  authorized  CFD Bonds  have  already  been  issued  or the Council  has  covenanted  that  it  will  not  issue  any 
additional  CFD  Bonds  (except  refunding  bonds)  to  be  supported  by  Special  Taxes;  and  (iii)  all  authorized 
facilities have been constructed or acquired and paid for from  Bonds and/or Special Taxes. 

Notwithstanding the above,  under no circumstances will the Facilities Special  Tax  levied  against any 
Assessor's Parcel  of Residential  Property  for  which  an. occupancy permit for  private residential  use  has been 
issued  be  increased  by more than  ten  percent annually  up to the  Maximum  Special  Tax  as  a  consequence of 
delinquency or default by the owner of any other Assessor's Parcel within the CFO. 

F. 

APPEALS 

Any taxpayer that believes that the amount of the Special Tax assigned to a  Parcel  is in  error may  fi1e 
a written notice with the CFD Administrator appealing the  levy  of the  Special Tax.  This notice  is  required  to 
be filed with the  CFO Administrator during the Fiscal Year the error is believed to  have  occurred.  The  CFD 
Administrator or designee will  then  promptly  review the appeal  and,  if necessary, meet  with the taxpayer.  If 
the CFD Administrator verifies that the tax  should be changed the Special  Tax  levy  shall  be corrected and,  if 
applicable in any case, a refund shall be granted. 

F. 

MANNER OF COLLECilON 

Special  Tax  as  levied  pursuant  to  Section  D above  shall  be collected  in  the  same manner and  at  the 
same time as ordinary ad valorem property taxes; provided, however, that the CFD Administrator may  directly 
bill the Special Tax, may collect Special Taxes at a different time or in  a different manner if necessary to meet 
the financial obligations of the  CFO or as otherwise determined appropriate by the CFO Administrator. 

G. 

TRANSFER OF SPECIAL TAX OBLIGATION 

Taxable  Property  acquired  by  a  public  agency  after  the  CFO  is  formed  will  remain  subject  to  the 
applicable  Facilities  Special  Tax  unless  the  Facilities  Special  Tax  obligation  is  satisfied  pursuant  to  Section 
53317.5  of the  Government  Code.  An  exception  to  this  may  be  made  if an  Assessor's  Parcel  of Public 
Property, such as a school  site,  is relocated to an  Assessor's Parcel(s) of Taxable Property, the previously  Tax(cid:173)
Exempt  Property  of comparable acreage  becomes  Taxable  Property  and  the  Maximum  Special  Tax  from  the 
previously Taxable Property  is  transferred to the new Taxable Property.  This trading of Special Taxes will  be 
permitted to the extent that there is no net loss in  Maximum Special Tax revenue.

For Assessor Parcels of Developed  Property,  compute the Facilities Special  Tax for 
the Assessor's  Parcel  to be  prepaid.  For Assessor  Parcels  of Update Property  to  be 
prepaid,  compute  the  Facilities  Special  Tax  for  that  Assessor's  Parcel  as though  it 
was already designated as Developed Property, based upon the building permit which 
has  already  been  issued  for  that  Assessor's  Parcel.  For Assessor Parcels  of Taxable 
Public  Property  and/or  Taxable  Association  Property  to  be  prepaid,  compute  the 
Facilities Special Tax for that Assessor's Parcel. 

Divide  the  Facilities  Special  Tax  computed  pursuant  to  paragraph  I  by  the  total 
estimated  Facilities  Special  Taxes  as  set  forth  in  Attachment  1 for  the  CFD which 
could be charged, less any Assessor Parcels which have been prepaid. 

Multiply the quotient computed pursuant to paragraph 2 by the Outstanding Bonds to 
compute  the  amount  of Outstanding  Bonds  to  be  retired  and  prepaid  (the  'Bond 
Redemption Amount''). 

Multiply  the  Bond  Redemption  Amount  computed  pursuant  to  paragraph  3  by  the 
applicable  redemption  premium,  if any,  on  the  Outstanding  Bonds  to  be  redeemed 
(the "Redemption Premium"). 

Compute the current Future Facilities Costs. 

Multiply  the quotient computed  pursuant to paragraph  2  by  the  amount  determined 
pursuant  to  paragraph  5  to  compute  the  amount  of Future  Facilities  Costs  to  be 
prepaid (the "Future Facilities Amounf'). 

Compute the  amount  needed  to  pay  interest on  the Bond  Redemption  Amount  from 
the first  bond interest and/or principal payment date following  the current Fiscal Year 
until the earliest redemption date for the Outstanding Bonds. 

Compute the amount the  CFD  Administrator reasonably  expects  to  derive  from  the 
reinvestment of the  Prepayment  Amount  less the Administrative Fees  and  Expenses 
from  the date of prepayment  until  the  redemption  date  for the Outstanding Bonds to 
be redeemed with the prepayment. 

Add  the  amounts  computed  pursuant  to  paragraph  7  and  subtract  the  amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph 8 (the "Defeasance Amount''). 

Add  the  costs  of computation  of the prepayment, the costs to  invest the  prepayment 
proceeds,  the costs of redeeming  the Outstanding  Bonds,  and  the  costs  of recording

refundable deposit.(the "Administrative Fees and Expenses"). 

The reserve fund credit (the "Reserve Fund  Credit")  shall  equal  the  lesser of, (a) the 
expected  reduction  in  the reserve  requirement (as defined  in  the  Indenture).  if any, 
associated  with the redemption  of Outstanding Bonds as  a result  of the prepayment, 
or (b}  the amowrt derived  by  subtracting the new  reserve requirement {as defined in 
the Indenture) in effect after the redemption of Outstanding Bonds as a result of the 
prepayment  from  the  balance in  the  reserve  find  on  the  prepayment  date,  but  in  no 
event shall such amount be  less than zero. 

The Facilities Special  Tax prepayment  is  equal to the sum of the amounts computed 
pursuant  to  paragraphs  3,  4,  6,  9  and  I 0,  less  the  amount  computed  pursuant  to 
paragraph  1 t (the "Prepayment Amount"). 

From the Prepayment Amount, the amounts computed pursuant to paragraphs 3, 4, 9 
and  1 1 shall be deposited  into the appropriate fund  as established under the Indenture 
and be used to retire Outstanding Bonds or make debt service payments. The amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph 6 shall be deposited into the Construction Fund. The 
ammmt computed pursuant to paragraph  IO  shall be retained by the CFD. 

In  addition,  any  property  owner  prepaying  its  Facilities  Special  Taxes  must  pay  current  and  any 

delinquent Special Taxes and penalties prior to prepayment. 

· 

The Prepayment Amount may be sufficient to redeem  other than a $5,000 increment of Bonds. In such 
cases,  the  increment  above  $5,000  or  integral  multiple  thereof  will  be  retained  in  the  appropriate  fund 
established  under  the  Indenture  to  be  used  with  the  next  prepayment  of bonds  or  to  make  debt  service 
payments. 

With respect to any Assessor's Parcel that  is  prepaid, once the  CFO Administrator  has  confirmed that 
all  levied  Special  Taxes have been  paid, the  City  shall  cause  a  suitable  notice  to  be  recorded  in  compliance 
with the Act,  to indicate the prepayment of Facilities  Special  Tax  and  the release of the  Facilities Special  Tax 
lien  on  such  Assessor's  Parcel,  and  the obligation  of such  Assessor's  Parcel  to pay the  facilities  Special  Tax 
shall cease. 

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no  Facilities  Special  Tax  prepayment  shall  be  allowed  unless  the 
amount of Facilities Special Taxes that may  be levied on Taxable Property within the  CFD after the proposed 
prepayment  is at least  1.1  times  the  maximum  annual  debt  service  on  all  Outstanding Prepayment  Bonds.  In 
addition, prepayment of the FacHities Special Tax shall  not relieve any  property owner of Developed Property 
from paying the Public Safety Special Tax. 

2. 

Prepayment in Part 

The  Maximum  Facilities  Special  Tax  on  an  Assessor's  Parcel  of Residential  Property  or an 
Assessor's  Parcel  of Update  Property  may  be  partially  prepaid  at  or  prior  to  the  close  of 
escrow to the first  private residential  user such that the  resulting  Maximum  Facilities Special 
Tax  for  the  Assessor's  Parcel  is  equal  to $840.00.  The  amount  of the  prepayment  shall  be 
calculated  as in  Section H.J; except that a partial  prepayment shall  be calculated according to 
the following formula: 

PP =PE x F 

These terms have the following meaning: 

C-2-9PP =  the partial prepayment 
PE =  the Prepayment Amount calculated according to Section H.1 
F  =  the  percent  by  which  the  owner  of the  Assessor  Parcel(s)  is  partially  prepaying  the 
Maximum Facilities Special Tax. 

The  owner  of an  Assessor's  Parcel  who  desires  to  partially  prepay  the  Maximum  Facilities 
Special Tax shall notify the  CFD Administrator of (i) such  owner's  intent to partially prepay 
the Maximum Facilities Special Tax, and (ii) the company or agency that will be acting as the 
escrow agent, if applicable. The CFO Administrator shall provide the owner with a statement 
of the amount required  for the partial  prepayment of the Maximum Facilities  Special  Tax for 
an  Assessor's  Parcel  within  30  days  of the  request  and  may  charge  a  reasonable  fee  for 
providing this service. Administrative  Fees and  Expenses calculated pursuant to Section H.1 
Paragraph  IO  shall be added after the partial prepayment has been calculated. 

With respect to any Assessor's Parcel that is partially prepaid, the  CFO Administrator shall  (i) 
distnl>ute the funds  remitted to it according to Paragraph 13 of Section H.1, and ii) indicate in 
the records of the  CFO that  there  has  been  a  partial  prepayment  of the  Maximum  Facilities 
Special  Tax  and  that the Maximum  Facilities Special  Tax  equal  to $840.00 shall  continue to 
be authorized to be levied on such Assessor's Parcel pursuant to Section D. 

3. 

Mandatory Prepayment 

Upon notification  by the City of the  approval  or the recordation  of a Final  Subdivision Map, 
the CFD  Administrator will  assign  Units/Acres  to  each  of the newly  created  parcels.  If the 
number  of Units/Acres  assigned  to the  Final  Subdivision  Map  is  less  than  the  number  of 
Units/Acres assigned in Attachment  I, the City shall (i) calculate the loss of Facilities Special 
Taxes by  multiplying  the number of reduced  Units/Acres  by  the  Facilities  Special  Tax  per

Elk Grove, California 95758 
 

 
Members of the Authority: 

 
OPINION:  $90,630,000 Elk Grove Finance Authority Special Tax 

Revenue Bonds, Series 2015 
 

 

 

 

 

 
We have acted as bond counsel to the Elk Grove Finance Authority (the “Authority”) in 
connection  with  the  delivery  by  the  Authority  of  the  above-referenced  bonds  (the  “Bonds”), 
issued  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Marks-Roos  Local  Bond  Pooling  Act  of  1985, 
constituting  Article  4  (commencing  with  Section  6584)  of  Chapter  5,  Division  7,  Title  1  of  the 
Government Code of the State of California (the “Bond Law”), and pursuant to an Indenture of 
Trust dated as of July 1, 2015 (the “Indenture”), between the Authority and U.S. Bank National 
Association, as trustee.  We have examined the Bond Law, an executed copy of the Indenture 
and such certified proceedings and other papers as we deem necessary to render this opinion. 

 
As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon representations of 
the Authority contained in the Indenture and in the certified proceedings and other certifications 
of  public  officials  furnished  to  us,  without  undertaking  to  verify  the  same  by  independent 
investigation. 

 
Based upon our examination we are of the opinion, under existing law, that: 
 
1.  The Authority is a public agency duly organized and existing under the laws of the 
State of California, with power to enter into the Indenture, to perform the agreements on its part 
contained therein and to issue the Bonds. 

 
2.  The Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Authority and 
are  legal,  valid  and  binding  obligations  of  the  Authority,  payable  solely  from  the  sources 
provided therefor in the Indenture. 

 
3.  The Indenture has been duly approved by the Authority and constitutes a legal, valid 
and binding obligation of the Authority enforceable against the Authority in accordance with its 
terms. 

 

D-1 

 
 

4.  Pursuant to the Bond Law, the Indenture establishes a valid lien on and pledge of 

the Revenues (as such term is defined in the Indenture) for the security of the Bonds. 

 
5.  Interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes 
and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax imposed 
on individuals and corporations; it should be noted, however, that for the purpose of computing 
the  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  corporations  (as  defined  for  federal  income  tax 
purposes), such interest is taken into account in determining certain income and earnings.  The 
opinions set forth in the preceding sentence are subject to the condition that the Authority and 
the City of Elk Grove (the “City”) comply with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended, that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that 
interest  thereon  be,  or  continue  to  be,  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax 
purposes.  The Authority and the City have covenanted to comply with each such requirement.  
Failure to comply with certain of such requirements may cause the inclusion of interest on the 
Bonds in gross income for federal income tax purposes to be retroactive to the date of issuance 
of  the  Bonds.    We  express  no  opinion  regarding  other  federal  tax  consequences arising  with 
respect to the ownership, sale or disposition of the Bonds, or the amount, accrual or receipt of 
interest on the Bonds.

The  rights  of  the  owners  of  the  Bonds  and  the  enforceability  of  the  Bonds  and  the 
Indenture  are  limited  by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  and  other  similar 
laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and by equitable principles, whether considered at law 
or in equity. 

 
This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or 
supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or  circumstances that may hereafter come to our 
attention, or any changes in law that may hereafter occur. Our engagement with respect to this 
matter has terminated as of the date hereof.

qualifier  “if  material.”    The  City  shall  cause  a  notice  to  be  filed  as  set  forth  in  paragraph  (b) 
above  with  respect  to  any  such  event  only  to  the  extent  that  the  City  determines  the  event’s 
occurrence is material for purposes of U.S. federal securities law. 

For  purposes  of  this  Disclosure  Certificate,  any  event  described  in  paragraph 
(a)(12)  above  is  considered  to  occur  when  any  of  the  following  occur:    the  appointment  of  a 
receiver,  fiscal  agent,  or  similar  officer  for  the  City  in  a  proceeding  under  the  United  States 
Bankruptcy  Code  or  in  any  other  proceeding  under  state  or  federal  law  in  which  a  court  or 
governmental authority has assumed jurisdiction over substantially all of the assets or business 
of the City, or if such jurisdiction has been assumed by leaving the existing governing body and 
officials  or  officers  in  possession  but  subject  to  the  supervision  and  orders  of  a  court  or 
governmental  authority,  or  the  entry  of  an  order  confirming  a  plan  of  reorganization, 
arrangement,  or  liquidation  by  a  court  or  governmental  authority  having  supervision  or 
jurisdiction over substantially all of the assets or business of the City. 

 
Section 6. Identifying Information for Filings with the MSRB.  All documents provided to 
the MSRB under the Disclosure Certificate shall be accompanied by identifying information as 
prescribed by the MSRB.  

 
Section  7.  Termination  of  Reporting  Obligation.  The  City’s  obligations  under  this 
Disclosure Certificate shall terminate upon the legal defeasance, prior redemption or payment in 
full of all of the Bonds. If such termination occurs prior to the final maturity of the Bonds, the City 
shall give notice of such termination in the same manner as for a Listed Event under Section 
5(c).

Section 8. Dissemination Agent. The City may, from time to time, appoint or engage a 
Dissemination Agent to assist it in carrying out its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate, 
and  may  discharge  any  Dissemination  Agent,  with  or  without  appointing  a  successor 
Dissemination Agent. The initial Dissemination Agent shall be NBS.  Any Dissemination Agent 
may resign by providing 30 days’ written notice to the City. 

 
Section 9. Amendment; Waiver. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Disclosure 
Certificate, the City may amend this Disclosure Certificate, and any provision of this Disclosure 
Certificate may be waived, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: 

 

(a) 

if the amendment or waiver relates to the provisions of Sections 3(a), 4 or 
5(a), it may only be made in connection with a change in circumstances that arises from 
a  change  in  legal  requirements,  change  in  law,  or  change  in  the  identity,  nature,  or 
status of an obligated person with respect to the Bonds, or type of business conducted; 

the undertakings herein, as proposed to be amended or waived, would, in 
the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with the requirements 
of the Rule at the time of the primary offering of the Bonds, after taking into account any 
amendments or interpretations of the Rule, as well as any change in circumstances; and 

the  proposed  amendment  or  waiver  either  (i)  is  approved  by  holders  of 
the Bonds in the manner provided in the Indenture for amendments to the Indenture with 
the  consent  of  holders,  or  (ii)  does  not,  in  the  opinion  of  nationally  recognized  bond 
counsel, materially impair the interests of the holders or beneficial owners of the Bonds. 

 
(b) 

 
(c) 

 

If the annual financial information or operating data to be provided in the Annual Report 
is  amended  pursuant  to  the  provisions  hereof,  the  first  Annual  Report  filed  pursuant  hereto 
containing the amended operating data or financial information shall explain, in narrative form, 
the reasons for the amendment and the impact of the change in the type of operating data or 
financial information being provided. 

 
If  an  amendment  is  made  to  this  Disclosure  Certificate  modifying  the  accounting 
principles  to  be  followed  in  preparing  financial  statements,  the  Annual  Report  for  the  year  in 
which  the  change  is  made  shall  present  a  comparison  between  the  financial  statements  or 
information prepared on the basis of the new accounting principles and those prepared on the 
basis of the former accounting principles. The comparison shall include a qualitative discussion 
of the differences in the accounting principles and the impact of the change in the accounting 
principles  on  the  presentation  of  the  financial  information,  in  order  to  provide  information  to 
investors to enable them to evaluate the ability of the City to meet its obligations. To the extent 
reasonably feasible, the comparison shall be quantitative.  

 
A notice of any amendment made pursuant to this Section 9 shall be filed in the same 

manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5(c). 

 
Section 10. Additional Information. Nothing in this Disclosure Certificate shall be deemed 
to prevent the City from disseminating any other information, using the means of dissemination 
set forth in this Disclosure Certificate or any other means of communication, or including any 
other information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event, in addition to 
that  which  is  required  by  this  Disclosure  Certificate.    If  the  City  chooses  to  include  any 
information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event in addition to that 
which  is  specifically  required  by  this  Disclosure  Certificate,  the  City  shall  have  no  obligation 

E-6 

 

 

 

under this Disclosure Certificate to update such information or include it in any future Annual 
Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event. 

 
Section  11.  Default.  If  the  City  fails  to  comply  with  any  provision  of  this  Disclosure 
Certificate,  the  Participating  Underwriter  or  any  holder  or  beneficial  owner  of  the  Bonds  may 
take such actions as may be necessary and appropriate, including seeking mandate or specific 
performance  by  court  order,  to  cause  the  City  to  comply  with  its  obligations  under  this 
Disclosure Certificate.  A default under this Disclosure Certificate shall not be deemed an Event 
of  Default  under  the  Indenture,  and  the  sole  remedy  under  this  Disclosure  Certificate  in  the 
event of any failure of the City to comply with this Disclosure Certificate shall be an action to 
compel performance. 

 
Section  12.  Duties,  Immunities  and  Liabilities  of  Dissemination  Agent.  (a)  The 
Dissemination Agent shall have only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Disclosure 
Certificate,  and  the  City  agrees  to  indemnify  and  save  the  Dissemination  Agent,  its  officers, 
directors, employees and agents, harmless against any loss, expense and liabilities which they 
may incur arising out of or in the exercise or performance of its powers and duties hereunder, 
including the costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) of defending against any claim of 
liability,  but  excluding  liabilities  due  to  the  Dissemination  Agent’s  negligence  or  willful 
misconduct.  The Dissemination Agent shall have no duty or obligation to review any information 
provided  to  it  by  the  City  hereunder,  and  shall  not  be  deemed  to  be  acting  in  any  fiduciary 
capacity for the City, the Bond holders or any other party.  The obligations of the City under this 
Section  shall  survive  resignation  or  removal  of  the  Dissemination  Agent  and  payment  of  the 
Bonds. 
 
(b)  The  Dissemination  Agent  shall  be  paid  compensation  by  the  City  for  its  services 
provided hereunder in accordance with its schedule of fees as amended from time to time, and 
shall  be  reimbursed  for  all  expenses,  legal  fees  and  advances  made  or  incurred  by  the 
Dissemination Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder. 

 
Section 13. Beneficiaries. This Disclosure Certificate shall inure solely to the benefit of 
the City, the Dissemination Agent, the Participating Underwriter and the holders and beneficial 
owners from time to time of the Bonds, and shall create no rights in any other person or entity.

DTC AND THE BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY SYSTEM 

APPENDIX F 

 

 

The following description of the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), the procedures and 
record keeping with respect to beneficial ownership interests in the Bonds, payment of principal, 
interest  and  other  payments  on  the  Bonds  to  DTC  Participants  or  Beneficial  Owners, 
confirmation  and  transfer  of  beneficial  ownership  interest  in  the  Bonds  and  other  related 
transactions  by  and  between  DTC,  the  DTC  Participants  and  the  Beneficial  Owners  is based 
solely  on  information  provided  by  DTC.    Accordingly,  no  representations  can  be  made 
concerning these matters and neither the DTC  Participants nor the Beneficial Owners should 
rely on the foregoing information with respect to such matters, but should instead confirm the 
same with DTC or the DTC Participants, as the case may be.   

 
Neither the issuer of the Bonds (the “Issuer”) nor the trustee, fiscal agent or paying agent 
appointed  with  respect  to  the  Bonds  (the  “Agent”)  take  any  responsibility  for  the  information 
contained in this Appendix.  

 
No  assurances  can  be  given  that  DTC,  DTC  Participants  or  Indirect  Participants  will 
distribute to the Beneficial Owners (a) payments of interest, principal or premium, if any, with 
respect to the Bonds, (b) certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation or 
ownership interest in the Bonds, or (c) redemption or other notices sent to DTC or Cede & Co., 
its nominee, as the registered owner of the Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis, or 
that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this 
Appendix.  The current "Rules" applicable to DTC are on file with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission  and  the  current  "Procedures"  of  DTC  to  be  followed  in  dealing  with  DTC 
Participants are on file with DTC. 

The  Depository  Trust  Company  (“DTC”),  New  York,  NY,  will  act  as  securities 
depository  for  the  Bonds  (the  “Securities”).    The  Securities  will  be  issued  as  fully-registered 
securities  registered  in  the  name  of  Cede  &  Co.  (DTC’s  partnership  nominee)  or  such  other 
name  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized  representative  of  DTC.    One  fully-registered 
Security certificate will be issued for each maturity of the Securities in the aggregate principal 
amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.  If, however, the aggregate principal 
amount of any issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each 
$500 million of principal amount, and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any 
remaining principal amount of such issue. 

 
1. 

 
2. 

DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company 
organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the 
New  York  Banking  Law,  a  member  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System,  a  “clearing  corporation” 
within  the  meaning  of  the  New  York  Uniform  Commercial  Code,  and  a  “clearing  agency” 
registered  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Section 17A  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934.  
DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity 
issues,  corporate  and  municipal  debt  issues,  and  money  market  instruments  (from  over  100 
countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC.  DTC also facilitates 
the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in 
deposited  securities,  through  electronic  computerized  book-entry  transfers  and  pledges 
between  Direct  Participants’  accounts.    This  eliminates  the  need  for  physical  movement  of 
securities certificates.  Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and 

F-1 

 

 
3. 

 
4. 

 
5. 

 
6. 

 

dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations.  DTC is 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”).  DTCC is 
the  holding  company  for  DTC,  National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  and  Fixed  Income 
Clearing  Corporation,  all  of  which  are  registered  clearing  agencies.    DTCC  is  owned  by  the 
users of its regulated subsidiaries.  Access to the DTC system is also available to others such 
as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing 
corporations  that  clear  through  or  maintain  a  custodial  relationship  with  a  Direct  Participant, 
either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).  DTC is rated “AA+” by Standard & Poor’s.  
The  DTC  Rules  applicable  to  its  Participants  are  on  file  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission.  More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. 

Purchases  of  Securities  under  the  DTC  system  must  be  made  by  or  through 
Direct  Participants,  which  will  receive  a  credit  for  the  Securities  on  DTC’s  records.    The 
ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be 
recorded  on  the  Direct  and  Indirect  Participants’  records.    Beneficial  Owners  will  not  receive 
written confirmation from DTC of their purchase.  Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to 
receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements 
of  their  holdings,  from  the  Direct  or  Indirect  Participant  through  which  the  Beneficial  Owner 
entered  into  the  transaction.    Transfers  of  ownership  interests  in  the  Securities  are  to  be 
accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf 
of  Beneficial  Owners.    Beneficial  Owners  will  not  receive  certificates  representing  their 
ownership interests in Securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the 
Securities is discontinued. 

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct Participants 
with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other 
name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  The deposit of Securities 
with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not 
effect  any  change  in  beneficial  ownership.    DTC  has  no  knowledge  of  the  actual  Beneficial 
Owners  of  the  Securities;  DTC’s  records  reflect  only  the  identity  of  the  Direct  Participants  to 
whose accounts such Securities are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners.  
The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings 
on behalf of their customers. 

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, 
by  Direct  Participants  to  Indirect  Participants,  and  by  Direct  Participants  and  Indirect 
Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any 
statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  Beneficial Owners of 
Securities  may  wish  to  take  certain  steps  to  augment  the  transmission  to  them  of  notices  of 
significant  events  with  respect  to  the  Securities,  such  as  redemptions,  tenders,  defaults,  and 
proposed  amendments  to  the  Security  documents.    For  example,  Beneficial  Owners  of 
Securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Securities for their benefit has 
agreed  to  obtain  and  transmit  notices  to  Beneficial  Owners.    In  the  alternative,  Beneficial 
Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies 
of notices be provided directly to them. 

Redemption notices will be sent to DTC.  If less than all of the Securities within a 
maturity are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of 
each Direct Participant in such maturity to be redeemed.

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote 
with respect to Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s 
MMI Procedures.  Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Authority as 
soon as possible after the record date.  The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or 
voting  rights  to  those  Direct  Participants  to  whose  accounts  Securities  are  credited  on  the 
record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). 

Principal, redemption price and interest payments on the Securities will be made 
to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of 
DTC.  DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and 
corresponding  detail  information  from  the  Authority  or  the  Paying  Agent,  on  payable  date  in 
accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records.  Payments by Participants 
to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is 
the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street 
name,”  and  will  be  the  responsibility  of  such  Participant  and  not  of  DTC,  the  Agent,  or  the 
Issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  
Payment  of  principal,  redemption  price  and  interest  payments  to  Cede  &  Co.  (or  such  other 
nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of 
the  Issuer  or  the  Agent,  disbursement  of  such  payments  to  Direct  Participants  will  be  the 
responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the 
responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. 

If  applicable,  a  Beneficial  Owner  will  give  notice  to  elect  to  have  its  Securities 
purchased  or  tendered,  through  its  Participant,  to  tender/remarketing  agent,  and  will  effect 
delivery of such Securities by causing the Direct Participant to transfer the Participant’s interest 
in the Securities, on DTC’s records, to tender/remarketing agent.  The requirement for physical 
delivery  of  Securities  in  connection  with  an  optional  tender  or  a  mandatory  purchase  will  be 
deemed  satisfied  when  the  ownership  rights  in  the  Securities  are  transferred  by  Direct 
Participants  on  DTC’s  records  and  followed  by  a  book-entry  credit  of  tendered  Securities  to 
tender/remarketing agent’s DTC account. 

DTC  may  discontinue  providing  its  services  as  depository  with  respect  to  the 
Securities  at  any  time  by  giving  reasonable  notice  to  the  Issuer  or  the  Agent.    Under  such 
circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificates are 
required to be printed and delivered. 

The  Issuer  may  decide  to  discontinue  use  of  the  system  of  book-entry-only 
transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository).  In that event, Security certificates 
will be printed and delivered to DTC.

BUILD  AMERICA  MUTUAL  ASSURANCE  COMPANY  (“BAM”),  for  consideration  received,  hereby  UNCONDITIONALLY 
AND IRREVOCABLY agrees to pay to the trustee (the “Trustee”) or paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the Bonds named above (as set 
forth in the documentation providing for the issuance and securing of the Bonds), for the benefit of the Owners or, at the election of BAM, 
directly to each Owner, subject only to the terms of this Policy (which includes each endorsement hereto), that portion of the principal of and 
interest on the Bonds that shall become Due for Payment but shall be unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Issuer. 

On  the  later  of  the  day  on  which  such  principal  and  interest  becomes  Due  for  Payment  or  the  first  Business  Day  following  the 
Business Day on which BAM shall have received Notice of Nonpayment, BAM will disburse (but without duplication in the case of duplicate 
claims for the same Nonpayment) to or for the benefit of each Owner of the Bonds, the face amount of principal of and interest on the Bonds 
that is then Due for Payment but is then unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Issuer, but only upon receipt by BAM, in a form reasonably 
satisfactory to it, of (a) evidence of the Owner’s right to receive payment of such  principal or interest then Due for Payment and (b) evidence, 
including any appropriate instruments of assignment, that all of the Owner’s rights with respect to payment of such principal or interest that is 
Due for Payment shall thereupon vest in BAM. A Notice of Nonpayment will be deemed received on a given Business Day if it is received 
prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on such Business Day; otherwise, it will be deemed received on the next Business Day.  If any Notice of 
Nonpayment received by BAM is incomplete, it shall be deemed not to have been received by BAM for purposes of the preceding sentence, 
and BAM shall promptly so advise the Trustee, Paying Agent or Owner, as appropriate, any of whom may submit an amended Notice of 
Nonpayment.  Upon disbursement under this Policy in respect of a Bond and to the extent of such payment, BAM shall become the owner of 
such Bond, any appurtenant coupon to such Bond and right to receipt of payment of principal of or interest on such Bond and shall be fully 
subrogated to the rights of the Owner, including the Owner’s right to receive payments under such Bond. Payment by BAM either to the 
Trustee  or  Paying  Agent  for  the  benefit  of  the  Owners,  or  directly  to  the  Owners,  on  account  of  any  Nonpayment  shall  discharge  the 
obligation of BAM under this Policy with respect to said Nonpayment. 

Except to the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, the following terms shall have the meanings specified for all 
purposes of this Policy.  “Business Day” means any day other than (a) a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on which banking institutions in the 
State of New York or the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent (as defined herein) are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.  
“Due for Payment” means (a) when referring to the principal of a Bond, payable on the stated maturity date thereof or the date on which the 
same shall have been duly called for mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by 
reason of call for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration or other advancement of maturity (unless BAM 
shall  elect,  in  its  sole  discretion,  to  pay  such  principal  due  upon  such  acceleration  together  with  any  accrued  interest  to  the  date  of 
acceleration) and (b) when referring to interest on a Bond, payable on the stated date for payment of interest. “Nonpayment” means, in respect 
of a Bond, the failure of the Issuer to have provided sufficient funds to the Trustee or, if there is no Trustee, to the Paying Agent for payment 
in full of all principal and interest that is Due for Payment on such Bond.  “Nonpayment” shall also include, in respect of a Bond, any payment 
made to an Owner by or on behalf of the Issuer of principal or interest that is Due for Payment, which payment has been recovered from such 
Owner pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code in accordance with a final, nonappealable order of a court having competent jurisdiction.  
“Notice” means delivery to BAM of a notice of claim and certificate, by certified mail, email or telecopy as set forth on the attached Schedule or 
other acceptable electronic delivery, in a form satisfactory to BAM, from and signed by an Owner, the Trustee or the Paying Agent, which notice 
shall specify (a) the person or entity making the claim, (b) the Policy Number, (c) the claimed amount, (d) payment instructions and (e) the date such 
claimed amount becomes or became Due for Payment.  “Owner” means, in respect of a Bond, the person or entity who, at the time of Nonpayment, is 
entitled under the terms of such Bond to payment thereof, except that “Owner” shall not include the Issuer, the Member or any other person or entity 
whose direct or indirect obligation constitutes the underlying security for the Bonds. 

 

 

 

BAM may appoint a fiscal agent (the “Insurer’s Fiscal Agent”) for purposes of this Policy by giving written notice to the Trustee, the 
Paying Agent, the Member and the Issuer specifying the name and notice address of the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent.  From and after the date of receipt of 
such notice by the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Member or the Issuer (a) copies of all notices required to be delivered to BAM pursuant to this 
Policy shall be simultaneously delivered to the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent and to BAM and shall not be deemed received until received by both and (b) all 
payments required to be made by BAM under this Policy may be made directly by BAM or by the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent on behalf of BAM.  The 
Insurer’s Fiscal Agent is the agent of BAM only, and the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent shall in no event be liable to the Trustee, Paying Agent or any Owner 
for any act of the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent or any failure of BAM to deposit or cause to be deposited sufficient funds to make payments due under this 
Policy. 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, BAM agrees not to assert, and hereby waives, only for the benefit of each Owner, all 
rights  (whether  by  counterclaim,  setoff  or  otherwise)  and  defenses  (including,  without  limitation,  the  defense  of  fraud),  whether  acquired  by 
subrogation, assignment or otherwise, to the extent that such rights and defenses may be available to BAM to avoid payment of its obligations under 
this Policy in accordance with the express provisions of this Policy.  This Policy may not be canceled or revoked. 

This Policy sets forth in full the undertaking of BAM and shall not be modified, altered or affected by any other agreement or instrument, 
including any modification or amendment thereto.  Except to the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, any premium paid in respect of 
this Policy is nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever, including payment, or provision being made for payment, of the Bonds prior to maturity. 
THIS POLICY IS NOT COVERED BY THE PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE SECURITY FUND SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 76 OF THE 
NEW YORK INSURANCE LAW.  THIS POLICY IS ISSUED WITHOUT CONTINGENT MUTUAL LIABILITY FOR ASSESSMENT.  

In witness whereof, BUILD AMERICA MUTUAL ASSURANCE COMPANY has caused this Policy to be executed on its behalf by its 

Authorized Officer.
