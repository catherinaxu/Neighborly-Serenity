In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, LLP, Bond Counsel to the bond issuer, the Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency (the “Agency”), based 
upon an analysis of existing statutes, regulations, rulings, and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and 
compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Series 2009A Bonds and the Series 2009B Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes 
under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), and interest on the Series 2009A Bonds and Series 2009B Bonds is exempt from State of 
California  personal  income  taxes.    In  the  further  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel,  interest  on  the  Series  2009A Bonds  and  the  Series  2009B  Bonds  is  not  a  specific 
preference item for purposes of the federal individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes, nor is it included in adjusted current earnings when calculating 
corporate alternative minimum taxable income.  Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, 
or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Series 2009A Bonds and Series 2009B Bonds.  See “TAX MATTERS.”

receive certificates representing their interest in the Bonds of any series purchased.  See “THE BONDS – Book-Entry Only System.” 
 
Payments of principal of and interest on each series of Bonds will be made by the Trustee to DTC, which will in turn remit such principal and interest to 
its participants for subsequent dispersal to beneficial owners of the applicable Bonds as described herein.  Interest on each series of Bonds is payable semiannually 
on each February 1 and August 1, commencing February 1, 2010, until the maturity or the earlier redemption thereof.  Principal and any redemption premiums with 
respect to each Bond will be paid upon surrender of such Bond at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee upon maturity or the earlier redemption thereof.  
See “THE BONDS – Description of Each Series of Bonds.” 
 
described herein. 
THE BONDS OF EACH SERIES ARE LIMITED OBLIGATIONS OF THE AGENCY PAYABLE SOLELY FROM AND SECURED SOLELY BY

REVENUES AND MONEYS HELD IN CERTAIN OF THE FUNDS ESTABLISHED UNDER SUCH APPLICABLE INDENTURE.  NEITHER THE BONDS 
OF  EACH  SERIES  NOR  THE  OBLIGATIONS  OF  THE  AGENCY  UNDER  THE  RESPECTIVE  INDENTURES  REPRESENT  DEBTS  OF  THE  CITY  OF 
BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA (THE “CITY”), THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA (THE “STATE”), OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OF THE STATE 
(OTHER THAN THE AGENCY), AND NONE OF THE CITY, THE STATE, OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OF THE STATE (OTHER THAN THE 
AGENCY)  IS  LIABLE  FOR  ANY  OF  THE  BONDS.    THE  BONDS  OF  EACH  SERIES  DO  NOT  CONSTITUTE  AN  INDEBTEDNESS  WITHIN  THE 
MEANING OF ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY DEBT LIMITATION OR RESTRICTION.  NEITHER THE MEMBERS OF THE AGENCY NOR 
ANY PERSONS EXECUTING THE BONDS OF ANY SERIES ARE LIABLE PERSONALLY ON SUCH BONDS BY REASON OF THEIR ISSUANCE.  THE

Project Area (the (cid:147)Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area(cid:148)) and the Southeast Bakersfield Redevelopment 
Project Area (the (cid:147)Southeast Project Area(cid:148)), which are within the City(cid:146)s boundaries.  Proceeds from the

Project Area or the Southeast Project Area (collectively, the (cid:147)Project Areas(cid:148)), as applicable, which are 
more particularly described below. 

The Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.  The City approved the redevelopment plan for the 
Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area (the (cid:147)Old Town Kern-Pioneer Redevelopment Plan(cid:148)) pursuant to 
Ordinance  No.  3904,  adopted  by  the  City  Council  on  June  30,  1999  (the  (cid:147)Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer 
Ordinance(cid:148)).    The  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Redevelopment  Plan  is  scheduled  to  terminate  on 
June 30, 2029, and provides that the total outstanding principal amount of any bonds issued and repayable 
from  tax  increment  generated  from  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area  shall  not  exceed 
$141 million  at  any  one  time.    The  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area  encompasses  approximately 
1,970 acres of land in the eastern portion of the City, and is generally located north of California Avenue 
and south of Columbus Street, between Oak Street on the west and Virginia Street on the east.  The Old 
Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area  is  zoned  for  a  combination  of  public,  commercial,  industrial,  and 
residential uses.  See THE PROJECT AREAS (cid:150) The Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.(cid:148) 

The  Southeast  Project  Area.    The  City  approved  the  original  redevelopment  plan  for  the 
Southeast Project Area pursuant to Ordinance No. 3905, adopted by the City Council on June 30, 1999 
(the (cid:147)Southeast Ordinance(cid:148)).  The City subsequently amended the redevelopment plan for the Southeast 
Project  Area  pursuant  to  Ordinance  No. 4002,  adopted  by  the  City  Council  on  March 28, 2001.    The 
redevelopment plan for the Southeast Project Area, as amended, is referred to herein as the (cid:147)Southeast 
Redevelopment Plan.(cid:148)  The Southeast Redevelopment Plan is scheduled to terminate on June 30, 2029, 
and  provides  that  the  total  outstanding  principal  amount  of  any  bonds  issued  and  repayable  from  tax 
increment generated from the Southeast Project Area shall not exceed $94 million at any one time.  The 
Southeast Project Area encompasses approximately 4,755 acres of land in the southeastern portion of the 
City, and is comprised of two non-contiguous sub areas.  The larger sub area is generally located between 
(cid:147)H(cid:148) Street and Oswell Street, from north of California Avenue to south of California State Route 58.  The 
smaller sub area is generally located between Casa Loma Drive and Pacheco Road, from Union Avenue 
to east of Cottonwood Road.  The Southeast Project Area is primarily zoned for residential uses, but also 
includes  sizable  public,  commercial,  and  industrial  components.    See  THE  PROJECT  AREAS  (cid:150)  The 
Southeast Project Area.(cid:148) 

Outstanding Parity Debt – Series 2009A Bonds 

The  Agency  has  previously  entered  into  the  CIEDB  Loan  Agreement  (as  defined  herein),

Loan  is  30  years  from  such  effective  date.    Repayment  of  the  CIEDB  Loan  is  secured  by  Net  Tax 
Increment Revenues (as defined herein) generated in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area and the 

4 

 

Agency(cid:146)s  obligation  to  repay  the  CIEDB  Loan  is  on  a  parity  with  the  Series  2009A  Bonds.    See

generated within the Southeast Project Area, which lien is superior to the lien that secures the repayment 
of the Series 2009B Bonds.  See (cid:147)SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2009B BONDS (cid:150) Outstanding Senior 
Debt (cid:150) Series 2009B Bonds(cid:148) and (cid:147) (cid:150) Prohibition Against Additional Senior Debt.(cid:148)

Authority for Issuance; Limited Obligations 

THE BONDS 

The  Bonds  of  each  series  are  being  issued  pursuant  to  the  California  Constitution  and  under 
authority granted to the Agency by the Law, the Bond Resolutions, and the provisions of the applicable 
Indenture.    The  Bonds  of  each  series  are  limited  obligations  of  the  Agency  payable  solely  from  and 
secured solely by the amounts pledged therefor under the applicable Indenture.  The amounts pledged to 
secure  the  Series  2009A  Bonds  are  comprised  of  Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  generated  by  the  Old 
Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area and moneys held in certain of the funds established under the Series 
2009A  Indenture.  The amounts pledged to secure the Series 2009B Bonds are comprised of Net Tax 
Increment Revenues generated by the Southeast Project Area and moneys held in certain of the funds 
established under the Series 2009B Indenture.  Neither the Bonds of each series nor the obligations of the 
Agency  under  the  Indentures,  as  applicable,  represent  a  debt  of  the  City,  the  State,  or  any  political 
subdivision  of  the  State  (other  than  the  Agency),  and  none  of  the  City,  the  State,  or  any  political 
subdivision of the State (other than the Agency) is liable for the Bonds of each series.  The Bonds of each 
series  do  not  constitute  an  indebtedness  within  the  meaning  of  any  constitutional  or  statutory  debt 
limitation or restriction.  Neither the members of the Agency nor any persons executing any of the Bonds 
are liable personally on such Bonds by reason of their issuance.  The Agency has no taxing power.  For a 
discussion  of  some  of  the  risks  associated  with  the  purchase  of  the  Bonds  of  each  series,  see  (cid:147)RISK 
FACTORS.(cid:148)  See also (cid:147)SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2009A BONDS,(cid:148) (cid:147)SECURITY FOR SERIES 
2009B BONDS,(cid:148) and (cid:147)LIMITATIONS ON TAX INCREMENT REVENUES.(cid:148) 

Description of Each Series of Bonds 

Each series of Bonds is being issued in the respective aggregate principal amount set forth on the 
cover  page  hereof.    Bonds  of  each  series  will  be  issued  in  denominations  of  $5,000  each  or  integral 
multiples thereof and will be dated the date of their original issuance.  Subject to a possible redemption 
prior to  maturity  as provided  in the  applicable  Indenture,  the  Bonds  of each  series  will  mature  on the 
respective dates and bear interest in the respective amounts set forth on the cover page hereof.  Interest on 
each  series  of  Bonds  is  payable  semiannually  on  each  February  1  and  August  1,  commencing 
February 1, 2010. 

The Bonds of each series will be delivered in fully registered form without coupons and, when 
delivered, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, 
New  York,  New  York  ((cid:147)DTC(cid:148)).    DTC  will  act  as  securities  depository  for  each  series  of  Bonds.  
Individual  purchases  of  Bonds  of  each  series  may  be  made  in  book-entry  form  only,  in  the  principal 
amount of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof for each maturity.  Purchasers will not receive certificates 
representing their interest in the Bonds purchased.  Payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds of 
each series will be made by the Trustee to DTC, which will in turn remit such principal and interest to its 
participants for subsequent dispersal to beneficial owners of such Bonds as described herein.  See (cid:147)THE 
BONDS (cid:150) Book-Entry Only System.(cid:148) 

Negotiated Sale of Bonds 

Upon  their  issuance,  each  series  of  Bonds  will  be  sold  by  the  Agency  to  the  Authority,  and 
concurrently resold by the Authority to the Underwriter, pursuant to the Marks-Roos Act and the terms of 
the  Bond  Purchase  Agreement.    See  (cid:147)THE  FINANCING  PLAN,(cid:148)  (cid:147)THE  AUTHORITY,(cid:148)  and

withdrawn by the Trustee at any time, upon the written request of the Agency, for the purchase of such 
Term Series 2009A Bonds at public or private sale as and when and at such prices (including brokerage 
and  other  charges)  as  the  Agency  may  in  its  discretion  determine,  but  not  in  excess  of  the  principal 
amount  thereof  plus  accrued  interest  to  the  purchase  date.    Any  accrued  interest  payable  upon  the 
purchase  of  any  Term  Series  2009A  Bonds  shall  be  paid  from  amounts  held  in  the  Debt  Service  and 
Reserve Fund (OTK-P) for the payment of interest on the next following Interest Payment Date.  The 
principal  amount  of  any Term  Series 2009A  Bonds so  purchased  by  the Trustee  in any  twelve-month 
period ending 60 days prior to any applicable Sinking Account Payment Date in any year shall be credited

Purchase  of  Term  Series  2009B  Bonds  In  Lieu  of  Mandatory  Redemption.    In  lieu  of  the 
mandatory sinking account redemption of any Term Series 2009B Bonds, amounts on deposit in the Debt 
Service  and  Reserve  Fund  (SE)  established  under  the  Series  2009B  Indenture,  which  amounts  are 
available  for  deposit  or  deposited  in  the  Term  Bond  Sinking  Account  therein,  may  also  be  used  and 
withdrawn by the Trustee at any time, upon the written request of the Agency, for the purchase of such 
Term Series 2009B Bonds at public or private sale as and when and at such prices (including brokerage 
and  other  charges)  as  the  Agency  may  in  its  discretion  determine,  but  not  in  excess  of  the  principal 
amount  thereof  plus  accrued  interest  to  the  purchase  date.    Any  accrued  interest  payable  upon  the 
purchase  of  any  Term  Series  2009B  Bonds  shall  be  paid  from  amounts  held  in  the  Debt  Service  and 
Reserve Fund (SE) for the payment of interest on the next following Interest Payment Date.  The principal 
amount of any Term Series 2009B Bonds so purchased by the Trustee in any twelve-month period ending 

11 

 

60 days prior to any applicable Sinking Account Payment Date in any year shall be credited towards and 
shall reduce the principal amount of such Term Series 2009B Bonds required to be redeemed on such 
Sinking Account Payment Date in such year. 

Notice of Redemption.  Notice of redemption of Bonds of any series shall be mailed by first class 
mail  by  the  Trustee  not  less  than  30  nor  more  than  60  days  prior  to  the  redemption  date  to  (i) the 
respective  Owners  of  Bonds  designated  for  redemption  at  their  addresses  appearing  on  the  bond 
registration books of the Trustee as of the fifteenth day prior to the date of mailing such notice, (ii) one or 
more Information Services, and (iii) the Securities Depositories.  Notice of redemption to the Securities 
Depositories and Information Services may also be given by certified, registered, or overnight mail, by 
facsimile  transmission,  or  by  such  other  confirmable  method  as  may  be  requested  by  the  Securities 
Depositories.  Each notice of redemption shall state the date of such notice, the Bonds to be redeemed, the 
date of issue of such Bonds, the redemption date, the redemption price, the place or places of redemption 
(including the name and appropriate address or addresses), the CUSIP number (if any) of the maturity or 
maturities, and, if less than all of any such maturity are to be redeemed, the respective portions of the 
principal amount thereof to be redeemed.  Each such notice shall also state that on said date there will 
become due and payable on each of such Bonds the redemption price thereof or of said specified portion 
of the principal amount thereof in the case of a Bond to be redeemed in part only, together with interest 
accrued thereon to the redemption date, and the premiums, if any thereof, and that from and after such 
redemption  date  interest  thereon  shall  cease  to  accrue,  and  shall  require  that  such  Bonds  be  then 
surrendered at the address or addresses of the Trustee specified in the redemption notice.  The Trustee 
shall mail by first class mail a second notice of redemption 60 days after the scheduled redemption date to 
Owners who failed to surrender their Bonds in connection with such redemption.  The Trustee may give 
notice  of redemption,  other  than  mandatory  sinking  account  redemptions  and  any  notices that  refer  to 
Bonds  that  are  being  advance  refunded,  conditioned  upon  receipt  of  funds  or  any  other  event.    The 
Trustee  may,  at  its  option,  or  upon  the  written  request  of  the  Agency,  prior  to  the  date  fixed  for 
redemption in any notice of redemption, rescind and cancel any notice of redemption by mailing notice of 
such rescission and cancellation in the same manner as the notice of redemption was provided under the 
applicable Indenture, and the applicable Bonds shall not be redeemed and shall remain outstanding, and 
the  Trustee  shall  not  be  liable  for  any  loss,  liability  or  expense  resulting  from  such  rescission  and 
cancellation of the notice of redemption. 

Disclosure of Redemptions.  Upon the occurrence of any contingent or other unscheduled Bond 
redemption under the applicable Indenture, notice thereof shall be given to each Repository pursuant to 
(and  as  defined 
  See  (cid:147)CONTINUING 
DISCLOSURE(cid:148) and (cid:147)APPENDIX F (cid:150) FORMS OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE CERTIFICATES.(cid:148) 

the  applicable  Continuing  Disclosure  Certificate. 

in) 

Effect of Redemption.  When notice of redemption has been duly given as aforesaid, and moneys 
for payment of the redemption price are being held by the Trustee, the Bonds of any series so called for 
redemption  shall,  on  the  redemption  date  designated  in  such  notice,  become  due  and  payable  at  the 
redemption price specified in such notice, and from and after the date so designated interest on the Bonds 
so  called  for  redemption  shall  cease  to  accrue, said Bonds  shall cease  to be  entitled  to any  benefit  or 
security  under the  applicable  Indenture, and the  Owners of said  Bonds  shall  have  no  rights  in  respect 
thereof except to receive payment of the redemption price thereof.  The Trustee shall, upon surrender for 
payment of any of said Bonds, pay such Bonds at the redemption price aforesaid.  All Bonds redeemed as 
described above shall be cancelled upon surrender thereof and delivered to the Agency, and no Bonds 
shall be issued in place thereof. 

Book-Entry Only System 

The following information regarding DTC and its book-entry system has been provided by DTC 
and has not been verified for accuracy or completeness by the Agency, and the Agency shall not have any 

12 

 

liability with respect thereto.  The Agency shall not have any responsibility or liability for any aspects of 
the records maintained by DTC relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership, or for 
maintaining, supervising, or reviewing any records maintained by DTC relating to beneficial ownership, 
of interests in the Bonds of each series. 

DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds of each series.  The Bonds of each series will 
be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC(cid:146)s partnership nominee) 
or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  One fully registered 
Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds of each series, in the aggregate principal 
amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. 

DTC,  the  world(cid:146)s  largest  securities  depository,  is  a  limited-purpose  trust  company  organized 
under  the  New  York  Banking  Law,  a  (cid:147)banking  organization(cid:148)  within  the  meaning  of  the  New  York 
Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a (cid:147)clearing corporation(cid:148) within the meaning of 
the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a (cid:147)clearing agency(cid:148) registered pursuant to the provisions 
of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 
3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money 
market instruments from over 100 countries that DTC(cid:146)s participants ((cid:147)Direct Participants(cid:148)) deposit with 
DTC.    DTC  also  facilitates  the  post-trade  settlement  among  Direct  Participants  of  sales  and  other 
securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and 
pledges  between  Direct  Participants(cid:146)  accounts.    This  eliminates  the  need  for  physical  movement  of 
securities certificates.  Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, 
banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations.  DTC is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ((cid:147)DTCC(cid:148)).  DTCC is the holding company 
for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation, and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which 
are registered clearing agencies.  DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries.  Access to the 
DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, 
banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship 
with  a  Direct  Participant,  either  directly  or  indirectly  ((cid:147)Indirect  Participants(cid:148)).    DTC  has  Standard  & 
Poor(cid:146)s highest rating: AAA.  The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities 
and  Exchange  Commission.    More  information  about  DTC  can  be  found  at  www.dtcc.com  and 
www.dtc.org. 

Purchases of the Bonds of each series under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct 
Participants, which will receive a credit for such Bonds on DTC(cid:146)s records.  The ownership interest of 
each  actual  purchaser  of  each  Bond  ((cid:147)Beneficial  Owner(cid:148))  is  in  turn  to  be  recorded  on  the  Direct  and 
Indirect Participants(cid:146) records.  Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their 
purchase.  Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of 
the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant 
through  which  the  Beneficial  Owner  entered  into  the  transaction.    Transfers  of  ownership  interests  in 
Bonds  of  each  series  are  to  be  accomplished  by  entries  made  on  the  books  of  Direct  and  Indirect 
Participants  acting  on  behalf  of  Beneficial  Owners.    Beneficial  Owners  will  not  receive  certificates 
representing their ownership interests in the Bonds of each series except in the event that use of the book-
entry system for the Bonds of each series is discontinued. 

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds of each series deposited by Direct Participants with 
DTC are registered in the name of DTC(cid:146)s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may 
be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  The deposit of Bonds of any series with DTC and 
their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in 
beneficial  ownership.    DTC  has  no  knowledge  of  the  actual  Beneficial  Owners  of  any  Bonds;  DTC(cid:146)s 
records  reflect  only  the identity  of  the  Direct  Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, 

13 

 

which  may  or  may  not  be  the  Beneficial  Owners.    The  Direct  and  Indirect  Participants  will  remain 
responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 

Conveyance  of  notices  and  other  communications  by  DTC  to  Direct  Participants,  by  Direct 
Participants  to  Indirect  Participants,  and  by  Direct  Participants  and  Indirect  Participants  to  Beneficial 
Owners  will  be  governed  by  arrangements  among  them,  subject  to  any  statutory  or  regulatory 
requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  Beneficial Owners of Bonds of each series may wish 
to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to 
such Bonds, such as redemptions, defaults, and proposed amendments to the related legal documents.  For 
example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds of any series may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding such 
Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners.  In the alternative, 
Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies 
of notices be provided directly to them. 

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC.  If less than all of the Bonds of any series are being 
redeemed, DTC(cid:146)s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in 
such issue to be redeemed. 

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to 
the  Bonds  of  any  series  unless  authorized  by  a  Direct  Participant  in  accordance  with  DTC(cid:146)s  MMI 
Procedures.  Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Agency as soon as possible 
after the Record Date.  The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.(cid:146)s consenting or voting rights to those 
Direct Participants to whose accounts the Bonds of any series are credited on the Record Date (identified 
in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). 

Redemption  proceeds,  distributions,  and  dividend  payments  with  respect to  the  Bonds  of  each 
series  will  be  made  to  Cede  &  Co.,  or  such  other  nominee  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized 
representative of DTC.  DTC(cid:146)s practice is to credit Direct Participants(cid:146) accounts, upon DTC(cid:146)s receipt of 
funds  and  corresponding  detail  information  from  the  Agency  or  the  Trustee,  on  the  payable  date  in 
accordance  with  their  respective  holdings  shown  on  DTC(cid:146)s  records.    Payments  by  Participants  to 
Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with 
securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in (cid:147)street name,(cid:148) and will be the

SECURITY FOR SERIES 2009A BONDS 

Pledge of Net Tax Increment Revenues 

The Series 2009A Bonds are limited obligations of the Agency, equally secured by an irrevocable 
pledge of all of the Net Tax Increment Revenues generated by the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area 
and all moneys in the Parity Debt Service Account within the Redevelopment Special Fund established 
under the Series 2009A Indenture, subject to certain limitations described below.  The Agency(cid:146)s payment 
obligations with respect to the CIEDB Loan are secured on a parity with the Agency(cid:146)s obligations with 
respect to the Series 2009A Bonds.  See (cid:147)Outstanding Parity Debt(cid:148) below. 

The  Agency(cid:146)s  payment  obligations  with  respect  to  HUD  Loan  No.  1  are  secured  by  an 
irrevocable pledge of all Tax Increment Revenues generated by the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area 
and  all  moneys  in  the  Senior  Debt  Service  Account  within  the  Redevelopment  Special  Fund,  which 
pledge is senior to pledge of Net Tax Increment Revenues to secure the Agency(cid:146)s payment obligations 
with respect to the Series 2009A Bonds and the CIEDB Loan.  See (cid:147)Outstanding Senior Debt (cid:150) Series 
2009A Bonds(cid:148) below.  The pledge under the Series 2009A Indenture constitutes a first lien on the Net 
Tax  Increment  Revenues  and  all  moneys  in  the  Parity  Debt  Service  Account  for  the  payment  of  the 
CIEDB Loan, the Series 2009A Bonds, and any other Additional Bonds. 

The term (cid:147)Tax Increment Revenues(cid:148) is defined in the Series 2009A Indenture as, for each fiscal 
year, beginning in the fiscal year in which the Series 2009A Bonds are issued, the money allocated or 
paid to the Agency derived from: 

(a) 

that  portion  of  taxes  levied  upon  assessable  property  in  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer 
Project  Area  allocated  to  the  Agency  pursuant  to  Article  6  of  Chapter  6  (commencing  with  Section 
33670) of the Law, Section 16 of Article XVI of the Constitution of the State of California, and the Old 
Town Kern-Pioneer Redevelopment Plan (exclusive of (i) amounts, if any, received by the Agency with 
respect to personal property in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area pursuant to Section 16111 of the 
California  Government  Code,  and  (ii) amounts  payable  by  the  Agency  pursuant  to  the  statutory  pass-
through payment obligations of the Agency in accordance with Section 33607.5 of the Law, except to the 
extent  that  the  County  withholds  such  amounts  for  direct  disbursement  to  the  pass-through  payment 
recipients, and further except to the extent such payments are subordinate to the payment of the required 
Annual Debt Service (as defined below); and 

(b) 

reimbursements,  subventions,  or  other  payments  made  by  the  State  of  California  with 
respect  to  any  property  taxes  that  would  otherwise  be  due  on  real  or  personal  property  but  for  an 
exemption of such property from such taxes, 

but  excluding  therefrom  that  portion  thereof  representing  the  Housing  Set-Aside  Revenues.    The  term 
(cid:147)Housing Set-Aside Revenues(cid:148) means, with respect to each Project Area and for a given fiscal year, that 
portion of taxes allocated to and received by the Agency with respect to such Project Area and required 
by Section 33334.2 of the Law to be deposited into the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund, which 
fund is required to be established and maintained by the Agency.  See (cid:147)THE PROJECT AREAS(cid:148) and 
(cid:147)LIMITATIONS ON TAX INCREMENT REVENUES.(cid:148) 

 
The term (cid:147)Net Tax Increment Revenues(cid:148) is defined in the Series 2009A Indenture as, for any 
given fiscal year, Tax Increment Revenues generated by the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area, less 
the obligations payable during such fiscal year on HUD Loan No. 1. 

16 

 

Outstanding Parity Debt 

The  Agency  has  previously  entered  into  a  Tax  Allocation  Loan  Agreement,  Agreement 
No. CIEDB 07-083, dated as of February 1, 2008 (the (cid:147)CIEDB Loan Agreement(cid:148)), by and between the 
Agency  and  the  California  Infrastructure  and  Economic  Development  Bank  ((cid:147)CIEDB(cid:148)),  pursuant  to 
which  the  Agency  borrowed  from  CIEDB  $10,000,000  (the  (cid:147)CIEDB  Loan(cid:148)),  the  repayment  of  which 
bears interest at a tax-exempt rate of 3.11% per annum.  The term of the CIEDB Loan is 30 years from 
the February 1, 2008, effective date.  Pursuant to the CIEDB Loan Agreement, repayment of the CIEDB 
Loan is secured by Net Tax Increment Revenues generated in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.  
The Agency(cid:146)s obligation to repay the CIEDB Loan  is on a parity with the Series 2009A Bonds.  See 
(cid:147)HISTORICAL  AND  PROJECTED  TAX  INCREMENT  REVENUES  (cid:150)  Projected  Tax  Increment 
Revenues and Debt Service Coverage for Series 2009A Bonds.(cid:148) 

Outstanding Senior Debt – Series 2009A Bonds 

The  Agency  has  previously  entered  into  HUD  Loan  No.  1,  pursuant  to  which  the  Agency 
borrowed $1,000,000, payable within a term of 20 years, to finance redevelopment activities in the Old 
Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.  Repayment of HUD Loan No. 1 is secured by a lien on Tax Increment 
Revenues generated within the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area, which lien is superior to the lien 
that secures the repayment of the Series 2009A Bonds and the CIEDB Loan. 

Reserve Account for Series 2009A Bonds 

Pursuant to the Series 2009A Indenture, the Reserve Account established within the Debt Service 
and Reserve Fund (OTK-P) is to be maintained by the Trustee in an amount that will be equal to the 
Reserve Account Requirement.  The term (cid:147)Reserve Account Requirement(cid:148) is defined in the Series 2009A 
Indenture as an amount equal to the least of (i) 10% of the proceeds of the Series 2009A Bonds and all 
other  Additional  Bonds  (defined,  for  purposes  of  the  Series  2009A  Indenture,  as  tax  allocation  bonds 
payable from the Net Tax Increment Revenues generated in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area and 
secured by a lien and charge upon such Net Tax Increment Revenues equal to and on a parity with the lien 
and charge securing the outstanding Series 2009A Bonds and CIEDB Loan), (ii) Maximum Annual Debt 
Service (as defined below) on the Series 2009A Bonds and all other Additional Bonds, or (iii) 125% of 
the Average Annual Debt Service (as defined below) on the Series 2009A Bonds and all other Additional 
Bonds; provided that, in the event proceeds of any Series 2009A Bonds and any other Additional Bonds 
are initially deposited into an escrow fund held by the Trustee, the Reserve Account Requirement shall be 
reduced in the same proportion that the principal amount of Series 2009A Bonds and other Additional 
Bonds that would be callable from the escrowed proceeds bears to the total principal amount of Series 
2009A Bonds and other Additional Bonds outstanding; provided further that, as used in this definition, 
the term (cid:147)Annual Debt Service(cid:148) shall exclude any payment obligations under the CIEDB Loan.. 

The term (cid:147)Maximum Annual Debt Service(cid:148) is defined in the Series 2009A Indenture as, as of any 
date of calculation, the largest Annual Debt Service during the period from such date of such calculation 
through the final maturity date of any outstanding Series 2009A Bonds and other Additional Bonds.  The 
term (cid:147)Annual Debt Service(cid:148) is defined in the Series 2009A Indenture as, for each fiscal year, the sum of 
(1) the  CIEDB  Loan  falling  due  in  such  fiscal  year,  together  with  (2)  the  interest  falling  due  on  the 
outstanding  Series  2009A  Bonds  and  other  Additional  Bonds  in  such  fiscal  year,  assuming  that  the 
outstanding serial Series 2009A Bonds and other serial Additional Bonds are retired as scheduled and that 
all outstanding Term Series 2009A Bonds and other term Additional Bonds, if any, are redeemed from 
such sinking account installment as may be scheduled, (3) the principal amount of all outstanding serial 
Series 2009A Bonds and other serial Additional Bonds, if any, falling due by their terms in such fiscal 
year, and (4) the sinking account installments required to be made in such fiscal year to pay or redeem 
outstanding Term Series 2009A Bonds and other term Additional Bonds. 

17 

 

All  money  in  or  credited to  the  Reserve  Account  shall  be used  and  withdrawn  by  the Trustee 
solely  for  the  purpose  of  replenishing  the  Interest  Account,  the  Principal  Account,  or  the  Term  Bond 
Sinking Account in such order, in the event of any deficiency in any of such accounts occurring on any 
Interest Payment Date, Principal Payment Date, or Sinking Account Payment Date, or for the purpose of 
paying the interest on or the principal of the Series 2009A Bonds and any other Additional Bonds, in the 
event that no other money of the Agency is lawfully available therefor, or for the retirement of all Series 
2009A Bonds and other Additional Bonds then outstanding, except that for so long as the Agency is not 
in default under the Series 2009A Indenture, any amount in the Reserve Account in excess of the Reserve 
Account Requirement shall be withdrawn from the Reserve Account by the Trustee and transferred to the 
Agency for deposit in the General Operating Account (OTK-P) within the Redevelopment Special Fund; 
provided that, in the event that a Reserve Account Credit Instrument (as defined below for purposes of the 
Series 2009A Indenture) is provided by the Agency to the Trustee for deposit in the Reserve Account, any 
amount then on deposit in the Reserve Account in excess of the Reserve Account Requirement as a result 
of such deposit of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument may, upon the written request of the Agency to 
the Trustee, be withdrawn from the Reserve Account by the Trustee and transferred to the Agency for 
deposit in the General Operating Account (OTK-P) within the Redevelopment Special Fund. 

No moneys in or credited to the Reserve Account shall be applied to the payment of any amounts 

owing with respect to the CIEDB Loan Agreement or HUD Loan No. 1. 

All or any portion of the Reserve Account Requirement with respect to any series of Additional 
Bonds may be satisfied by the provision of a policy of insurance, a surety bond, a letter of credit, or other 
comparable credit facility that meets the requirements contained in the Series 2009A Indenture (each, for 
purposes  of  the  Series  2009A  Indenture,  a  (cid:147)Reserve  Account  Credit  Instrument(cid:148)),  or  a  combination 
thereof, which, together with moneys on deposit in the Reserve Account, provide funds in an aggregate 
amount equal to the Reserve Account Requirement.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Series 2009A 
Indenture  to  the  contrary,  the  Reserve  Account  Requirement  for  the  Series  2009A  Bonds  may  not  be 
satisfied by the provision of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument, nor shall moneys on deposit in the 
Reserve  Account  in  satisfaction  of  that  portion  of  the  Reserve  Account  Requirement  relating  to  the 
Series 2009A  Bonds  be  withdrawn  from  the  Reserve  Account  for  the  purpose  of  replenishing  any 
deficiency in the Interest Account, the Principal Account, or the Term Bonds Sinking Account relating to 
payments of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on a series of Additional Bonds, the Reserve 
Account Requirement for which has been satisfied through the provision of a Reserve Account Credit 
Instrument. 

Issuance of Additional Bonds 

The Agency may at any time after the issuance and delivery of the Series 2009A Bonds issue 
Additional  Bonds  payable  from  the  Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  generated  in  the  Old  Town  Kern-
Pioneer Project Area and secured by a lien and charge upon such Net Tax Increment Revenues equal to 
and on a parity with the lien and charge securing the outstanding Series 2009A Bonds and CIEDB Loan, 
subject to the conditions for such issuance set forth in the CIEDB Loan Agreement, and subject further to 
the following conditions: 

(a) 

A certificate of the Agency shall have been filed with the Trustee to the effect that the 
Agency  shall  be  in  compliance  with  all  covenants  set  forth  in  the  Series  2009A  Indenture  and  any 
Supplemental Indentures, and no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing. 

(b) 

The issuance of such Additional Bonds shall have been duly authorized pursuant to the 
Law and all applicable laws, and the issuance of such Additional Bonds shall have been provided for by a 
Supplemental Indenture containing provisions as required in the Series 2009A Indenture. 

18 

 

(c) 

The Net Tax Increment Revenues generated in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area 
to be received by the Agency in each fiscal year during the term of the Additional Bonds, assuming no 
growth in assessed values, but taking into account all Plan Limits and other factors that would cause a 
reduction in such Net Tax Increment Revenues in any future fiscal year, plus, at the option of the Agency, 
the Additional Allowance, shall be equal to at least 125% of Maximum Annual Debt Service.  The term 
(cid:147)Additional  Allowance(cid:148)  means,  with  respect  to  the Old  Town Kern-Pioneer  Project,  as  of  the  date  of 
calculation, the amount of Net Tax Increment Revenues which, as shown in the report of an Independent 
Redevelopment Consultant (as defined in the Series 2009A Indenture), are estimated to be receivable by 
the Agency in the next succeeding fiscal year as a result of increases in the assessed valuation of taxable 
property in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area due to construction that has been completed or due 
to changes in ownership that have occurred, but are not yet been reflected on the tax roll.  For purposes of 
such  definition,  the  term  (cid:147)increases  in  assessed  valuation(cid:148)  means  the  amount  by  which  the  assessed 
valuation of taxable property in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area in the next succeeding fiscal 
year  is  estimated  to  exceed  the  assessed  valuation  of  taxable  property  in  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer 
Project Area (as evidenced in a written document from an appropriate official of the County) as of the 
date on which such calculation is made. 

(d) 

The conditions prescribed by the foregoing paragraph (c) need not be met with respect to 
the issuance of Additional Bonds the proceeds of which are to be used to refund all or any portion of any 
outstanding Series 2009A Bonds or previously issued Additional Bonds if, following the issuance of any 
such  refunding  Additional  Bonds,  the  annual  debt  service  with  respect  to  such  refunding  Additional 
Bonds during each fiscal year shall be equal to or less than debt service with respect to the outstanding 
Series 2009A Bonds or previously issued Additional Bonds refunded by such refunding Additional Bonds 
and the period for which the Agency shall be obligated to pay such debt service shall not extend beyond 
the  term  of  the  refunded  outstanding  Series  2009A  Bonds  or  previously  issued  Additional  Bonds,  as 
applicable. 

(e) 

For the purposes of the calculation of the coverage requirements set forth in the foregoing 
paragraph (c), Annual Debt Service shall not include the principal and interest attributable to any Series 
2009A Bonds or previously issued Additional Bonds, the proceeds of which are deposited in an escrow 
fund held by the Trustee, provided that the Supplemental Indenture authorizing the issuance of Additional 
Bonds shall provide that: 

(1) 

Such  proceeds  shall  be  deposited  or  invested  in  Federal  Securities  or  in  an 
Investment  Agreement  with  a financial institution  rated  (cid:147)AA(cid:148)  or  better  by  S&P(cid:146)s, at  a rate  of 
interest  which,  together  with  amounts  made  available  by  the  Agency  from  proceeds  of  Series 
2009A Bonds or previously issued Additional Bonds, or otherwise, is at least sufficient to pay 
Annual Debt Service on the Series 2009A Bonds and any previously issued Additional Bonds, the 
proceeds of which are to be deposited in the escrow fund held by the Trustee; 

(2) 

Moneys  may  be  transferred  from  said  escrow  fund  only  if  Net  Tax  Increment 
Revenues for the then current fiscal year will be at least equal to 125% of Annual Debt Service on 
all  outstanding  Series  2009A  Bonds  and  previously  issued  Additional  Bonds,  and  any 
unsubordinated loans, indebtedness, or other obligations payable from tax increment allocable to 
the Agency pursuant to Section 33670 of the Law (exclusive of disqualified Series 2009A Bonds 
or Additional Bonds described in the Series 2009A Indenture), less a principal amount of Series 
2009A Bonds and previously issued Additional Bonds that is equal to moneys on deposit in said 
escrow fund after each such transfer; and 

(3) 

Additional Bonds shall be redeemed from moneys remaining on deposit in said 
escrow fund at the expiration of a specified escrow period in such manner as may be determined 
by the Agency. 

19 

 

(f) 

Nothing in the Series 2009A Indenture limits the issuance of any tax allocation bonds of 
the  Agency  payable  from  the  Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  generated  by  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer 
Project Area and secured by a lien and charge on such Net Tax Increment Revenues if, after the issuance 
and  delivery  of  such  tax  allocation  bonds,  neither  the  CIEDB  Loan  Agreement  nor  any  of  the  Series 
2009A  Bonds  and  any  Additional  Bonds  theretofore  issued  under  the  Series  2009A  Indenture  will  be 
outstanding.  Furthermore, nothing contained in the Series 2009A Indenture limits the issuance of any tax 
allocation bonds of the Agency secured by a lien and charge on such Net Tax Increment Revenues junior 
to that of the CIEDB Loan, the Series 2009A Bonds and any Additional Bonds. 

The CIEDB Loan Agreement imposes several conditions that must be met prior to the issuance 
by the Agency of Additional Bonds, including, but not limited to, the requirement that all Tax Increment 
Revenues generated within the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area received or estimated to be received 
by the Agency in the then-current fiscal year (i) calculated using a tax rate of 1%, (ii) based on the most 
recent taxable valuation of property in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area, as evidenced in a written 
document from an appropriate official of the County, and (iii) exclusive of payments, reimbursements, 
and subventions, if any, specifically attributable to ad valorem taxes lost by reason of tax exemptions and 
tax rate limitations, shall be at least equal to 110% of Maximum Annual Debt Service, including within 
such  Maximum  Annual  Debt  Service  the  amount  of  maximum  annual  debt  service  on  the  Additional 
Bonds then proposed to be issued or incurred. 

Prohibition Against Additional Senior Debt 

With the exception of HUD Loan No. 1, the Series 2009A Indenture prohibits the Agency from 
incurring  any  additional  indebtedness,  or  issuing  any  additional  bonds,  secured  by  a  pledge,  lien,  or 
encumbrance  that  is  senior  to the  pledge  of  Net Tax  Increment  Revenues  generated  by  the  Old Town 
Kern-Pioneer Project Area established by the Series 2009A Indenture. 

SECURITY FOR SERIES 2009B BONDS 

Pledge of Net Tax Increment Revenues 

The Series 2009B Bonds are limited obligations of the Agency, equally secured by an irrevocable 
pledge of all of the Net Tax Increment Revenues generated by the Southeast Project Area and all moneys 
in the Bond Debt Service Account within the Redevelopment Special Fund established under the Series 
2009B Indenture, subject to certain limitations described below. 

The Agency(cid:146)s payment obligations with respect to HUD Loan No. 2 and HUD Loan No. 3 are 
secured by an irrevocable pledge of all Tax Increment Revenues generated by the Southeast Project Area 
and  all  moneys  in  the  Senior  Debt  Service  Account  within  the  Redevelopment  Special  Fund,  which 
pledge is senior to pledge of Net Tax Increment Revenues to secure the Agency(cid:146)s payment obligations 
with respect to the Series 2009B Bonds.  See (cid:147)Outstanding Senior Debt (cid:150) Series 2009B Bonds(cid:148) below.  
The pledge under the Series 2009B Indenture constitutes a first lien on the Net Tax Increment Revenues 
and all moneys in the Bond Debt Service Account for the payment of the Series 2009B Bonds and any 
other Additional Bonds. 

The term (cid:147)Tax Increment Revenues(cid:148) is defined in the Series 2009B Indenture as, for each fiscal 
year, beginning in the fiscal year in which the Series 2009B Bonds are issued, the money allocated or paid 
to the Agency derived from: 

(a) 

that  portion  of  taxes  levied  upon  assessable  property  in  the  Southeast  Project  Area 
allocated to the Agency pursuant to Article 6 of Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 33670) of the Law, 

20 

 

Section 16 of Article XVI of the Constitution of the State of California, and the Southeast Redevelopment 
Plan (exclusive of (i) amounts, if any, received by the Agency with respect to personal property in the 
Southeast Project Area pursuant to Section 16111 of the California Government Code, and (ii) amounts 
payable  by  the  Agency  pursuant  to  the  statutory  pass-through  payment  obligations  of  the  Agency  in 
accordance with Section 33607.5 of the Law, except to the extent that the County withholds such amounts 
for  direct  disbursement  to  the  pass-through  payment  recipients,  and  further  except  to  the  extent  such 
payments are subordinate to the payment of the required Annual Debt Service (as defined below); and 

(b) 

reimbursements,  subventions,  or  other  payments  made  by  the  State  of  California  with 
respect  to  any  property  taxes  that  would  otherwise  be  due  on  real  or  personal  property  but  for  an 
exemption of such property from such taxes, 

but excluding therefrom that portion thereof representing the Housing Set-Aside Revenues.  See (cid:147)THE 
PROJECT AREAS(cid:148) and (cid:147)LIMITATIONS ON TAX INCREMENT REVENUES.(cid:148) 

 
The term (cid:147)Net Tax Increment Revenues(cid:148) is defined in the Series 2009B Indenture as, for any 
given fiscal year, Tax Increment Revenues generated by the Southeast Project Area, less the obligations 
payable during such fiscal year on HUD Loan No. 2 and HUD Loan No. 3. 

Outstanding Senior Debt – Series 2009B Bonds 

The Agency has previously entered into:  (1) HUD Loan No. 2, pursuant to which the Agency 
borrowed $1,600,000, payable within a term of 20 years, to assist in financing a fire station within the 
Southeast Project Area; and (2) HUD Loan No. 3, pursuant to which the Agency borrowed $3,750,000, 
payable  within  a  term  of  20  years,  to  finance  the Mill  Creek  Mixed-Use  Project  within  the  Southeast 
Project  Area.    Repayment  of  HUD  Loan  No. 2  and  HUD  Loan  No.  3  is  secured  by  a  lien  on  Tax 
Increment Revenues generated within the Southeast Project Area, which lien is superior to the lien that 
secures the repayment of the Series 2009B Bonds. 

Reserve Account for Series 2009B Bonds 

Pursuant to the Series 2009B Indenture, the Reserve Account established within the Debt Service 
and Reserve Fund (SE) is to be maintained by the Trustee in an amount that will be equal to the Reserve 
Account  Requirement.    The  term  (cid:147)Reserve  Account  Requirement(cid:148)  is  defined  in  the  Series  2009B 
Indenture as an amount equal to the least of (i) 10% of the proceeds of the Series 2009B Bonds and all 
other  Additional  Bonds  (defined,  for  purposes  of  the  Series  2009B  Indenture,  as  tax  allocation  bonds 
payable  from  the  Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  and  secured  by  a  lien  and  charge  upon  the  Net  Tax 
Increment Revenues equal to and on a parity with the lien and charge securing the outstanding Series 
2009B Bonds), (ii) Maximum Annual Debt Service (as defined below) on the Series 2009B Bonds and all 
other  Additional  Bonds,  or  (iii) 125%  of  the  Average  Annual  Debt  Service  (as  defined  below)  on  the 
Series 2009B Bonds and all other Additional Bonds; provided that, in the event proceeds of any Series 
2009B  Bonds and  any  other  Additional  Bonds are  initially  deposited into an escrow  fund held  by  the 
Trustee,  the  Reserve  Account  Requirement  shall  be  reduced  in  the  same  proportion  that  the  principal 
amount of Series 2009B Bonds and other Additional Bonds that would be callable from the escrowed 
proceeds  bears  to  the  total  principal  amount  of  Series  2009B  Bonds  and  other  Additional  Bonds 
outstanding. 

The term (cid:147)Maximum Annual Debt Service(cid:148) is defined in the Series 2009B Indenture as, as of any 
date of calculation, the largest Annual Debt Service during the period from such date of such calculation 
through the final maturity date of any outstanding Series 2009B Bonds and other Additional Bonds.  The 
term (cid:147)Annual Debt Service(cid:148) is defined in the Series 2009B Indenture as, for each fiscal year, the sum of 
(1) the interest falling due on the outstanding Series 2009B Bonds and other Additional Bonds in such 

21 

 

fiscal year, assuming that the outstanding serial Series 2009B Bonds and other serial Additional Bonds 
are retired  as  scheduled and  that all  outstanding Term  Series 2009B  Bonds and  other term  Additional 
Bonds, if any, are redeemed from such sinking account installment as may be scheduled, (2) the principal 
amount of all outstanding serial Series 2009B Bonds and other serial Additional Bonds, if any, falling due 
by their terms in such fiscal year, and (3) the sinking account installments required to be made in such 
fiscal year to pay or redeem outstanding Term Series 2009B Bonds and other term Additional Bonds. 

All  money  in  or  credited to  the  Reserve  Account  shall  be used  and  withdrawn  by  the Trustee 
solely  for  the  purpose  of  replenishing  the  Interest  Account,  the  Principal  Account,  or  the  Term  Bond 
Sinking Account in such order, in the event of any deficiency in any of such accounts occurring on any 
Interest Payment Date, Principal Payment Date, or Sinking Account Payment Date, or for the purpose of 
paying the interest on or the principal of the Series 2009B Bonds and any other Additional Bonds, in the 
event that no other money of the Agency is lawfully available therefor, or for the retirement of all Series 
2009B Bonds and other Additional Bonds then outstanding, except that for so long as the Agency is not in 
default under the Series 2009B Indenture, any amount in the Reserve Account in excess of the Reserve 
Account Requirement shall be withdrawn from the Reserve Account by the Trustee and transferred to the 
Agency  for  deposit  in  the  General  Operating  Account  (SE)  within  the  Redevelopment  Special  Fund; 
provided that, in the event that a Reserve Account Credit Instrument (as defined below for purposes of the 
Series 2009B Indenture) is provided by the Agency to the Trustee for deposit in the Reserve Account, any 
amount then on deposit in the Reserve Account in excess of the Reserve Account Requirement as a result 
of such deposit of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument may, upon the written request of the Agency to 
the Trustee, be withdrawn from the Reserve Account by the Trustee and transferred to the Agency for 
deposit in the General Operating Account (SE) within the Redevelopment Special Fund. 

No moneys in or credited to the Reserve Account shall be applied to the payment of any amounts 

owing with respect to HUD Loan No. 2 or HUD Loan No. 3. 

All or any portion of the Reserve Account Requirement with respect to any series of Additional 
Bonds may be satisfied by the provision of a policy of insurance, a surety bond, a letter of credit, or other 
comparable credit facility that meets the requirements contained in the Series 2009B Indenture (each, for 
purposes  of  the  Series  2009B  Indenture,  a  (cid:147)Reserve  Account  Credit  Instrument(cid:148)),  or  a  combination 
thereof, which, together with moneys on deposit in the Reserve Account, provide funds in an aggregate 
amount equal to the Reserve Account Requirement.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Series 2009B 
Indenture  to  the  contrary,  the  Reserve  Account  Requirement  for  the  Series  2009B  Bonds  may  not  be 
satisfied by the provision of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument, nor shall moneys on deposit in the 
Reserve  Account  in  satisfaction  of  that  portion  of  the  Reserve  Account  Requirement  relating  to  the 
Series 2009B  Bonds  be  withdrawn  from  the  Reserve  Account  for  the  purpose  of  replenishing  any 
deficiency in the Interest Account, the Principal Account, or the Term Bonds Sinking Account relating to 
payments of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on a series of Additional Bonds, the Reserve 
Account Requirement for which has been satisfied through the provision of a Reserve Account Credit 
Instrument. 

Issuance of Additional Bonds 

The Agency may at any time after the issuance and delivery of the Series 2009B Bonds issue 
Additional Bonds payable from the Net Tax Increment Revenues generated in the Southeast Project Area 
and secured by a lien and charge upon such Net Tax Increment Revenues equal to and on a parity with the 
lien and charge securing the outstanding Series 2009B Bonds, subject to the following conditions: 

(a) 

A certificate of the Agency shall have been filed with the Trustee to the effect that the 
Agency  shall  be  in  compliance  with  all  covenants  set  forth  in  the  Series  2009B  Indenture  and  any 
Supplemental Indentures, and no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing. 

22 

 

(b) 

The issuance of such Additional Bonds shall have been duly authorized pursuant to the 
Law and all applicable laws, and the issuance of such Additional Bonds shall have been provided for by a 
Supplemental Indenture containing provisions as required in the Series 2009B Indenture. 

(c) 

The Net Tax Increment Revenues generated in the Southeast Project Area to be received 
by  the  Agency  in  each  fiscal  year  during  the  term  of  the  Additional  Bonds,  assuming  no  growth  in 
assessed values, but taking into account all Plan Limits and other factors that would cause a reduction in 
such  Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  in  any  future  fiscal  year,  plus,  at  the  option  of  the  Agency,  the 
Additional  Allowance,  shall  be  equal  to  at  least  125%  of  Maximum  Annual  Debt  Service.    The  term 
(cid:147)Additional Allowance(cid:148) means, with respect to the Southeast Project, as of the date of calculation, the 
amount of Net Tax Increment Revenues which, as shown in the report of an Independent Redevelopment 
Consultant (as defined in the Series 2009B Indenture), are estimated to be receivable by the Agency in the 
next succeeding fiscal year as a result of increases in the assessed valuation of taxable property in the 
Southeast Project Area due to construction that has been completed or due to changes in ownership that 
have occurred, but are not yet been reflected on the tax roll.  For purposes of such definition, the term 
(cid:147)increases in assessed valuation(cid:148) means the amount by which the assessed valuation of taxable property 
in  the  Southeast  Project  Area  in  the  next  succeeding  fiscal  year  is  estimated  to  exceed  the  assessed 
valuation of taxable property in the Southeast Project Area (as evidenced in a written document from an 
appropriate official of the County) as of the date on which such calculation is made. 

(d) 

The conditions prescribed by the foregoing paragraph (c) need not be met with respect to 
the issuance of Additional Bonds the proceeds of which are to be used to refund all or any portion of any 
outstanding Series 2009B Bonds or previously issued Additional Bonds if, following the issuance of any 
such  refunding  Additional  Bonds,  the  annual  debt  service  with  respect  to  such  refunding  Additional 
Bonds during each fiscal year shall be equal to or less than debt service with respect to the outstanding 
Series 2009B Bonds or previously issued Additional Bonds refunded by such refunding Additional Bonds 
and the period for which the Agency shall be obligated to pay such debt service shall not extend beyond 
the  term  of  the  refunded  outstanding  Series  2009B  Bonds  or  previously  issued  Additional  Bonds,  as 
applicable. 

(e) 

For the purposes of the calculation of the coverage requirements set forth in the foregoing 
paragraph (c), Annual Debt Service shall not include the principal and interest attributable to any Series 
2009B Bonds or previously issued Additional Bonds, the proceeds of which are deposited in an escrow 
fund held by the Trustee, provided that the Supplemental Indenture authorizing the issuance of Additional 
Bonds shall provide that: 

(1) 

Such  proceeds  shall  be  deposited  or  invested  in  Federal  Securities  or  in  an 
Investment  Agreement  with  a financial institution  rated  (cid:147)AA(cid:148)  or  better  by  S&P(cid:146)s, at  a rate  of 
interest  which,  together  with  amounts  made  available  by  the  Agency  from  proceeds  of  Series 
2009B Bonds or previously issued Additional Bonds, or otherwise, is at least sufficient to pay 
Annual Debt Service on the Series 2009B Bonds and any previously issued Additional Bonds, the 
proceeds of which are to be deposited in the escrow fund held by the Trustee; 

(2) 

Moneys  may  be  transferred  from  said  escrow  fund  only  if  Net  Tax  Increment 
Revenues for the then current fiscal year will be at least equal to 125% of Annual Debt Service on 
all  outstanding  Series  2009B  Bonds  and  previously  issued  Additional  Bonds,  and  any 
unsubordinated loans, indebtedness, or other obligations payable from tax increment allocable to 
the Agency pursuant to Section 33670 of the Law (exclusive of disqualified Series 2009B Bonds 
or Additional Bonds described in the Series 2009B Indenture), less a principal amount of Series 
2009B Bonds and previously issued Additional Bonds that is equal to moneys on deposit in said 
escrow fund after each such transfer; and 

23 

 

(3) 

Additional Bonds shall be redeemed from moneys remaining on deposit in said 
escrow fund at the expiration of a specified escrow period in such manner as may be determined 
by the Agency. 

(f) 

Nothing in the Series 2009B Indenture limits the issuance of any tax allocation bonds of 
the Agency payable from the Net Tax Increment Revenues generated in the Southeast Project Area and 
secured by a lien and charge on such Net Tax Increment Revenues if, after the issuance and delivery of 
such tax allocation bonds, none of the Series 2009B Bonds or any Additional Bonds theretofore issued 
under  the  Series  2009B  Indenture  will  be  outstanding.    Furthermore,  nothing  contained  in  the  Series 
2009B  Indenture  limits  the  issuance  of  any  tax  allocation  bonds  of  the  Agency  secured  by  a  lien  and 
charge on such Net Tax Increment Revenues junior to that of the Series 2009B Bonds and any Additional 
Bonds. 

Prohibition Against Additional Senior Debt 

With  the  exception  of  HUD  Loan  No.  2  and  HUD  Loan  No.  3,  the  Series  2009B  Indenture 
prohibits the Agency from incurring any additional indebtedness, or issuing any additional bonds, secured 
by a pledge, lien, or encumbrance that is senior to the pledge of Net Tax Increment Revenues generated 
by the Southeast Project Area established by the Series 2009B Indenture. 

ALLOCATION OF TAXES IN PROJECT AREAS 

The following disclosure describes the allocation and application of taxes in both of the Project 
Areas.  The  Net Tax  Increment  Revenues  that secure  the  Series 2009A  Bonds are  derived  from  taxes 
levied in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area only.  The Net Tax Increment Revenues that secure the 
Series  2009B  Bonds  are  derived  from  taxes  levied  in  the  Southeast  Project  Area  only.    See  (cid:147)THE 
PROJECT AREAS(cid:148) and (cid:147)HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED TAX INCREMENT REVENUES.(cid:148) 

Allocation and Application of Taxes in Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area 

As provided in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Redevelopment Plan, and in Article 6 of Chapter 6 
(commencing  with  Section  33670)  of  the  Law  and  Section 16  of  Article XVI  of  the  California 
Constitution, taxes levied on taxable property in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area each year by or 
for the benefit of the State, cities, counties, districts, or other public corporations (collectively, the (cid:147)Old 
Town  Kern-Pioneer  Taxing  Agencies(cid:148)),  for  fiscal  years  beginning  after  the  effective  date  of  the  Old 
Town Kern-Pioneer Redevelopment Plan, will be divided as follows: 

(a) 

That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied 
each  year  by  or  for  each  of  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Taxing  Agencies  upon  the  total  sum  of  the 
assessed value of the taxable property in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area as shown upon the 
assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of that property by such Old Town Kern-Pioneer 
Taxing Agency, last equalized prior to the effective date of the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Ordinance, shall 
be  allocated  to  and  when  collected  shall  be  paid  to  the  respective  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Taxing 
Agencies as taxes by or for such Old Town Kern-Pioneer Taxing Agencies on all other property are paid 
(for the purpose of allocating taxes levied by or for any Old Town Kern-Pioneer Taxing Agency that did 
not include the territory in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area on the effective date of the Old Town 
Kern-Pioneer  Ordinance  but  to  which  that  territory  has  been  annexed  or  otherwise  included  after  that 
effective  date,  the assessment roll  of  the  County  last  equalized  on  the  effective  date  of the  Old Town 
Kern-Pioneer Ordinance shall be used in determining the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the 
Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area on said effective date); and 

24 

 

(b) 

Except as provided in paragraph (c) below, that portion of the levied taxes each year in 
excess of that amount shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into a special fund of the 
Agency  to  pay  the  principal  of  and  interest  on  bonds,  loans,  moneys  advanced  to,  or  indebtedness 
(whether  funded, refunded,  assumed,  or  otherwise) incurred  by  the  Agency  to finance  or refinance, in 
whole or in part, the redevelopment activities in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.  Unless and 
until  the  total  assessed  valuation  of  the  taxable  property  in  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area 
exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area as 
shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred to in paragraph (a) above, all of the taxes levied and 
collected  upon  the  taxable  property  in  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area  shall  be  paid  to  the 
respective  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Taxing  Agencies.    When  the  bonds,  loans,  advances,  and 
indebtedness, if any, and interest thereon, have been paid, all moneys thereafter received from taxes upon 
the taxable property in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area shall be paid to the respective Old Town 
Kern-Pioneer Taxing Agencies as taxes on all other property are paid. 

(c) 

That portion of the taxes in excess of the amount identified in paragraph (a) above that 
are  attributable  to  a  tax  rate  levied  by  a  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Taxing  Agency  for  the  purpose  of 
producing  revenues  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  make  annual  repayments  of  the  principal  of,  and  the 
interest on, any bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property in the Old Town 
Kern-Pioneer Project Area shall be allocated to, and when collected shall be paid into, the fund of that 
Old Town Kern-Pioneer Taxing Agency.  This paragraph (c) shall only apply to taxes levied to repay 
bonded indebtedness approved by the voters of the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Taxing Agency on or after 
January 1, 1989. 

Pursuant  to  the  Series  2009A  Indenture,  the  Agency  will  apply  all  of  the  Tax  Increment 
Revenues,  and  any  interest  earned  thereon,  derived  from  the  property  in  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer 
Project Area and received in any fiscal year as follows: 

First, to the Senior Debt Service Account until the amount on deposit therein is equal to 

the debt service coming due on HUD Loan No. 1 during such fiscal year; 

Second, to the Parity Debt Service Account until the amount on deposit therein is equal to 
the sum of (a) the debt service coming due with respect to the CIEDB Loan and the outstanding 
Series 2009A Bonds, and any other Additional Bonds during such fiscal year, and (b) the amount, 
if any, required to be deposited in the Reserve Account in order to restore the balance on deposit 
therein to the Reserve Account Requirement; and 

Finally, to the General Operating Account (OTK-P) to be applied to any lawful purpose 

of the Agency with respect to the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.   

Section 33334.2 of the Law requires that not less than 20% of all taxes that are allocated to a 
redevelopment agency pursuant to Section 33670 of the Law must be used by such redevelopment agency 
for the purposes of increasing, improving, and preserving the community’s supply of low- and moderate-
income housing available at affordable housing cost to persons and families of low or moderate income, 
lower income households, very low income households, and extremely low income households (as such 
terms  are  defined  in  the  California  Health  and  Safety  Code)  that  is  occupied  by  these  persons  and 
families,  unless  such  redevelopment  agency  has  made  certain  findings  annually  by  resolution.    The 
Agency has not made such findings.  Section 33334.3 of the Law further requires that the funds that are 
required by the Law to be used for the purposes of increasing, improving, and preserving the community’s 
supply  of  low-  and  moderate-income  housing  must  be  held  in  a  separate  low  and  moderate  income 
housing fund until used for such purposes.

Allocation and Application of Taxes in Southeast Project Area 

As provided in the Southeast Redevelopment Plan, and in Article 6 of Chapter 6 (commencing 
with Section 33670) of the Law and Section 16 of Article XVI of the California Constitution, taxes levied 
on  taxable  property  in  the  Southeast  Project  Area  each  year  by  or  for  the  benefit  of  the  State,  cities, 
counties,  districts,  or  other  public  corporations  (collectively,  the  (cid:147)Southeast  Taxing  Agencies(cid:148)  and, 
together  with  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Taxing  Agencies,  the  (cid:147)Taxing  Agencies(cid:148)),  for  fiscal  years 
beginning after the effective date of the Southeast Redevelopment Plan, will be divided as follows: 

(a) 

That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied 
each year by or for each of the Southeast Taxing Agencies upon the total sum of the assessed value of the 
taxable property in the Southeast Project Area as shown upon the assessment roll used in connection with 
the taxation of that property by such Southeast Taxing Agency, last equalized prior to the effective date of 
the Southeast Ordinance, shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid to the respective Southeast 
Taxing Agencies as taxes by or for such Southeast Taxing Agencies on all other property are paid (for the 
purpose of allocating taxes levied by or for any Southeast Taxing Agency that did not include the territory 
in the Southeast Project Area on the effective date of the Southeast Ordinance but to which that territory 
has been annexed or otherwise included after that effective date, the assessment roll of the County last 
equalized  on  the  effective  date  of  the  Southeast  Ordinance  shall  be  used  in  determining  the  assessed 
valuation of the taxable property in the Southeast Project Area on said effective date); and 

(b) 

Except as provided in paragraph (c) below, that portion of the levied taxes each year in 
excess of that amount shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into a special fund of the 
Agency  to  pay  the  principal  of  and  interest  on  bonds,  loans,  moneys  advanced  to,  or  indebtedness 
(whether  funded, refunded,  assumed,  or  otherwise) incurred  by  the  Agency  to finance  or refinance, in 
whole or in part, the redevelopment activities in the Southeast Project Area.  Unless and until the total 
assessed valuation of the taxable property in the Southeast Project Area exceeds the total assessed value 
of  the  taxable  property  in  the  Southeast  Project  Area  as  shown  by  the  last  equalized  assessment  roll 
referred to in paragraph (a) above, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the taxable property in the 
Southeast  Project  Area  shall  be  paid  to  the  respective  Southeast  Taxing  Agencies.    When  the  bonds, 
loans,  advances,  and  indebtedness,  if  any,  and  interest  thereon,  have  been  paid,  all  moneys  thereafter 
received from taxes upon the taxable property in the Southeast Project Area shall be paid to the respective 
Southeast Taxing Agencies as taxes on all other property are paid. 

(c) 

That portion of the taxes in excess of the amount identified in paragraph (a) above that 
are attributable to a tax rate levied by a Southeast Taxing Agency for the purpose of producing revenues 
in an amount sufficient to make annual repayments of the principal of, and the interest on, any bonded 
indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property in the Southeast Project Area shall be 
allocated  to,  and  when  collected  shall  be  paid  into,  the  fund  of  that  Southeast  Taxing  Agency.    This 
paragraph (c) shall only apply to taxes levied to repay bonded indebtedness approved by the voters of the 
Southeast Taxing Agency on or after January 1, 1989. 

Pursuant  to  the  Series  2009B  Indenture,  the  Agency  will  apply  all  of  the  Tax  Increment 
Revenues, and any interest earned thereon, derived from the property in the Southeast Project Area and 
received in any fiscal year as follows: 

First, to the Senior Debt Service Account until the amount on deposit therein is equal to 

the debt service coming due on HUD Loan No. 2 and HUD Loan No. 3 during such fiscal year; 

Second, to the Bond Debt Service Account until the amount on deposit therein is equal to 
the sum of (a) the debt service coming due with respect to the outstanding Series 2009B Bonds 
and any other Additional Bonds during such fiscal year and (b) the amount, if any, required to be 

26 

 

deposited in the Reserve Account in order to restore the balance on deposit therein to the Reserve 
Account Requirement; and 

Finally, to the General Operating Account (SE) to be applied to any lawful purpose of the 

Agency with respect to the Southeast Project Area.  

Section 33334.2 of the Law requires that not less than 20% of all taxes that are allocated to a 
redevelopment agency pursuant to Section 33670 of the Law must be used by such redevelopment agency 
for the purposes of increasing, improving, and preserving the community’s supply of low- and moderate-
income housing available at affordable housing cost to persons and families of low or moderate income, 
lower income households, very low income households, and extremely low income households (as such 
terms  are  defined  in  the  California  Health  and  Safety  Code)  that  is  occupied  by  these  persons  and 
families,  unless  such  redevelopment  agency  has  made  certain  findings  annually  by  resolution.    The 
Agency has not made such findings.  Section 33334.3 of the Law further requires that the funds that are 
required by the Law to be used for the purposes of increasing, improving, and preserving the community’s 
supply  of  low-  and  moderate-income  housing  must  be  held  in  a  separate  low  and  moderate  income 
housing fund until used for such purposes. 

The Redevelopment Plans 

THE PROJECT AREAS 

The City has adopted redevelopment plans for the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area and the 

Southeast Project Area.  Such redevelopment plans are more particularly described below. 

Old Town Kern-Pioneer Redevelopment Plan.  The City approved the Old Town Kern-Pioneer 
Redevelopment  Plan  pursuant  to  Ordinance  No.  3904,  adopted  by  the  City  Council  on  June 30, 1999.  
The  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Redevelopment  Plan  is  scheduled  to  terminate  on  June 30, 2029,  and 
provides  that  the  total  outstanding  principal  amount  of  any  bonds  issued  and  repayable  from  tax 
increment generated from the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area shall not exceed $141 million at any 
one time. 

Southeast Redevelopment Plan.  The City approved the original Southeast Redevelopment Plan 
pursuant to Ordinance No. 3905, adopted by the City Council on June 30, 1999.  The City subsequently

Description of Project Areas 

Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.  The Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area encompasses 
approximately 1,970 acres of land in the eastern portion of the City, and is generally located north of 
California Avenue and south of Columbus Street, between Oak Street on the west and Virginia Street on 
the east.  The Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area is zoned for a combination of public, commercial, 
industrial, and residential uses.  See (cid:147)THE PROJECT AREAS (cid:150) Land Use in the Project Areas (cid:150) Land 
Use in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.(cid:148) 

To implement the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Redevelopment Plan, the Agency has undertaken a 
comprehensive redevelopment program in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area designed to eliminate 
physical and economic blight, revitalize the community, and prevent the spread of blight to surrounding 

27 

 

areas.    In  that  regard,  the  Agency  has  created  the  Baker  Street  Comprehensive  Economic  Strategy, 
launched in 2003 (the (cid:147)Baker Street Strategy(cid:148)).  The Baker Street Strategy was created with contributions 
from residents, business owners, government officials, social service providers, and private developers.  
The Baker Street Strategy sites the following ten priorities for the redevelopment of the Old Town Kern-
Pioneer  Project  Area:    (1) build  partnerships  between  the  Bakersfield  Police  Department  and  local 
neighborhood  crime  prevention  advocates;  (2) invest  in  and  maintain  streetscape  improvements; 
(3) redevelop the blocks between Kentucky Street, Lake Street, Kern Street, and King Street; (4) redesign 
International Square; (5) rehabilitate the Metropole building located at Baker Street and Sumner Street; 
(6) expand home ownership opportunities and existing housing outreach programs; (7) redevelop the car 
wash site located at Baker Street and Niles Street; (8) rehabilitate existing single-room occupancy hotels; 
(9) monitor  the  design  and  construction  of  the  Centennial  Freeway;  and  (10) preserve  and  re-use  the 
Union Pacific Train Depot. 

Some  of  the  redevelopment  projects  that  have  been  completed  in  the  Old Town  Kern-Pioneer 
Project  Area  since  the  adoption  of  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Redevelopment  Plan  include  the 
following: 

•  New Amtrak Station.  Construction of a new 8,000-square foot Amtrak railroad station (the 
(cid:147)Amtrak Station(cid:148)) near the Bakersfield Convention Center and Centennial Garden.  The new 
Amtrak  Station  includes  an  800-foot  long  passenger  platform  with  lighting,  canopies, 
pedestrian grade crossings between tracks, and concrete tile edges with a special raised safety 
pattern,  plus  parking  for  more  than  230  vehicles.    The  Amtrak  Station  was  completed  in 
2000. 

•  Park Place Apartments.  Construction of an 80-unit apartment complex on (cid:147)R(cid:148) Street called 
Park Place Apartments.  Golden Empire Affordable Housing, Inc., constructed the project, 
which consists of 64 one-bedroom and 16 two-bedroom apartments, two laundry rooms, a 
community  center,  arts  and  crafts  rooms,  a  courtyard,  a  security  system  and  a  live-in 
manager.  Eight of the units in the project are designed for the physically handicapped, and 
two units are equipped for the sensory impaired.  The Agency provided $800,000 in housing 
set-aside moneys derived from another redevelopment project area overseen by the Agency, 
the Downtown Project Area, to help finance the construction of the Park Place Apartments.  
Construction of the project was completed in 2001. 

•  Bakersfield  Rescue  Mission  Emergency  Housing.    Acquisition  of  additional  property  and 
construction  of  emergency  shelter  housing  for  the  Bakersfield  Rescue  Mission  (the 
(cid:147)Mission(cid:148)).  The Mission is a non-profit agency incorporated in 1952, which provides food, 
clothing, shelter, and rehabilitation opportunities for homeless men and women.  The Agency 
provided $75,000 in housing set-aside moneys derived from the Downtown Project Area to 
help finance the acquisition of land and construction of the emergency housing.  Construction 
of the project was completed in 2001. 

•  Baker Street Streetscape.  Construction of streetscape improvements to a four block area on 
the  west and  east  sides of  Baker  Street,  from  Jackson  Street  to  Niles  Street, including  the 
installation of trees, tree grates, automatic irrigation, decorative lights with banners, and trash 
receptacles.  HUD awarded the City an Economic Development Initiative grant in the amount 
of $280,000 to help finance the project, which was completed in 2006. 

A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Series 2009A Bonds will be used to finance the 
Facilities located in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area, which are expected to include (but are not 
limited to) the construction of senior housing, the construction of wastewater facilities, and the acquisition 

28 

 

and/or improvement of property for future development.  See (cid:147)FACILITIES TO BE FINANCED WITH 
BOND PROCEEDS.(cid:148) 

Southeast Project Area.  The Southeast Project Area encompasses approximately 4,755 acres of 
land  in  the  southeastern  portion  of  the  City,  and  is  comprised  of  two  non-contiguous  sub  areas.    The 
larger  sub  area  is  generally  located  between  (cid:147)H(cid:148)  Street  and  Oswell  Street,  from  north  of  California 
Avenue to south of California State Route 58.  The smaller sub area is generally located between Casa 
Loma Drive and Pacheco Road, from Union Avenue to east of Cottonwood Road.  The Southeast Project 
Area is primarily zoned for residential uses, but also includes sizable public, commercial, and industrial 
components.  See (cid:147)THE PROJECT AREAS (cid:150) Land Use in the Project Areas (cid:150) Land Use in the Southeast 
Project Area.(cid:148) 

To implement the Southeast Redevelopment Plan, the Agency has undertaken a comprehensive 
redevelopment program in the Southeast Project Area designed to eliminate physical and economic blight, 
revitalize  the  community,  and  prevent  the  spread  of  blight  to  surrounding  areas.    In  that  regard,  the 
Agency  has  conducted  the  Southeast  Bakersfield  Revitalization  Study,  completed  in  2001  (the 
(cid:147)Revitalization  Study(cid:148)),  and  the  Southeast  Bakersfield  Neighborhood  Design  Charrette,  conducted  in 
2003  (the  (cid:147)Design  Charrette(cid:148)).    The  Revitalization  Study  focused  on  issues  related  to  revitalizing  the 
commercial corridors that run through the Southeast Project Area and identified several significant areas 
of  concern,  including:    (1) the  lack  of  resident  access  to  supermarket  and  other  types  of  commercial 
services  common  to  other  urban  communities;  (2) the  physical  blight  along  the  Union  Avenue  and 
Lakeview  Avenue/Cottonwood  Road  corridors  due  to  demographic  changes  and  stagnant  incomes  in 
those  areas;  (3) the  absence  of  specialty  food  stores  and  personal  service  establishments  to  attract 
neighborhood shoppers; (4) the physical and economic decline of area motels due to a lack of investment 
and  new  development;  (5) the  need  for  expanded  home  ownership  and  for  the  expansion  of  existing 
housing outreach programs; and (6) the need to invest in and maintain streetscape improvements.  For the 
Design  Charrette,  the  City,  the  Golden  Empire  Chapter  of  the  American  Institute  of  Architects,  and 
approximately 150 residents collectively devised design and logistical recommendations for three major 
areas  of  the  required  redevelopment  in  the  Southeast  Project  Area:    housing  rehabilitation  and 
development, community improvements and services, and retail and business services. 

Some of the redevelopment projects that have been completed in the Southeast Project Area since 

the adoption of the Southeast Redevelopment Plan include the following: 

•  Victory  Circle.    Construction  of  a  30,000  square  foot  manufacturing  facility  for  race  car 
chassis  and  equipment  in  the  Gateway  Business  Park.    The  City  provided  a  $50,000 
Community  Development  Block  Grant  ((cid:147)CDBG(cid:148))  repayable  loan  for  permit  fees  and 
equipment, and the Agency provided $20,000 in redevelopment assistance. 

•  HPS Mechanical.  Construction of a 40,000 square foot manufacturing facility in the Gateway 
Business  Park.    The  City  provided  a  $50,000  CDBG  repayable  loan  for  permit  fees  and 
equipment, and the Agency provided $20,000 in redevelopment assistance. 

•  Little Saigon Plaza.  Construction of a 25,000 square foot shopping center on Union Avenue

Equities  ((cid:147)CVE(cid:148)).    The  City  provided  loan  assistance  to  CVE  for  the  construction  of 
approximately $2.7 million.  The total cost for the project was approximately $12 million. 

•  McMurtrey Aquatic Center.  Construction of an 8,000 square foot swimming pool with a zero 
depth entry area, a water slide, and lap lanes, located on a 2.3 acre triangular site bounded by

Assessed Values in the Project Areas 

Pursuant  to  the  Law  and  the  California  Constitution,  the  Agency  is  authorized  to  receive  that 
portion of property tax revenue generated in each Project Area in excess of the assessed value of property 
in such Project Area as shown on the last equalized tax roll prior to the adoption of the redevelopment 
plan for such Project Area (the (cid:147)Base Year Value(cid:148)).  Pursuant to the Law, the tax increment received by 
the Agency in any fiscal year, which is based on the taxable assessed value in excess of the Base Year 
Value  (the  (cid:147)incremental  value(cid:148)),  may  be  pledged  by  the  Agency  to  the  repayment  of  Agency 
indebtedness, including the Bonds.  

Assessed Values in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.  The Base Year Value for the Old 
Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area  was  originally  calculated  for  fiscal  year  1998-99  as  $332,701,474 
(comprised of secured assessed value of $304,471,462 and unsecured assessed value of $28,230,012).  In 
fiscal year 2007-08, the Base Year Value for the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area was revised to 
reflect  a  total  assessed  value  for  fiscal  year  1998-99  of  $325,761,415  (comprised  of  secured  assessed 
value of $297,531,403 and unsecured assessed value of $28,230,012).  The assessed value of property in 
the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area increased from fiscal year 1998-99 (the base year) to fiscal year 
2008-09 by approximately 83%.  The secured assessed value of property in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer 
Project  Area  increased  from  fiscal  year  2003-04  through  fiscal  year  2008-09  by  approximately  67%, 
primarily due to new residential and commercial development.  The unsecured assessed value of property 
in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area increased by approximately 39% during the same period. 

The following table sets forth the actual assessed values for the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project 

Area for fiscal years 2003-04 through 2008-09.

Assessment Appeals in the Project Areas 

Pursuant  to  Section  51  of  the  California  Revenue  and  Taxation  Code  ((cid:147)Section  51(cid:148)),  the 
determination of the assessed value of property in a Project Area may be appealed.  Such an appeal may 
be initiated by the County Assessor or by the applicable property owner.  Section 51 provides that, for 
each subsequent lien date, the value of the real property subject to the appeal shall be adjusted to be the 
lesser of its Base Year Value as adjusted by an inflation factor pursuant to Article XIIIA of the California 
Constitution  ((cid:147)Article  XIIIA(cid:148))  or  its  full  cash  value,  taking  into  account  reductions  in  value  due  to 
damage,  destruction,  depreciation,  obsolescence,  removal  of  property,  or  other  factors  causing  such  a 
reduction  in  value.    After  a  reduction  in  assessed  value  is  granted  pursuant  to  an  appeal,  the  subject 
property  is  reviewed  by  the  County  Assessor  annually  and  the  assessed  value  is  adjusted  further  if 
necessary.    Such annual review  may  result in additional reductions  or  increases  in the  assessed  value.  
Any such increases are required to be determined based on the full cash value of the subject property and, 
consequently, may exceed the maximum annual inflationary growth rate permitted under Article XIIIA.  
When the assessed value of the subject property is equal to or greater than the assessed value of such 
property  prior  to  the  appeal  (adjusted  for  inflation),  the  property  will  again  be  subject  to  the  annual 
inflationary factor growth rate allowed under Article XIIIA.  Assessment appeals may also be requested 
as adjustments to a property(cid:146)s Base Year Value.  If such an appeal is granted, the Base Year Value of the 
subject property is adjusted accordingly, and such Base Year Value is subsequently adjusted for any new 
construction, demolition, or any other changes requiring revaluation of the property(cid:146)s land, improvement, 
and  personal  property  values,  and  by  the  annual  inflationary  factor  growth  rate  allowed  under  Article 
XIIIA. 

Assessment  Appeals  in  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area.    There  are  three  pending 
assessment  appeals relating  to  property  in  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project Area  owned  by  one  or 
more of the top ten taxpayers in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.  Such pending assessment 
appeals are more particularly described in the following table:

Tax Rates in Project Areas 

A tax rate area ((cid:147)TRA(cid:148)) is a geographic area within which the taxes on all property within such 
area  are  levied  at  a  certain  rate  by  the  applicable  taxing  entities.    Each  such  taxing  entity  receives  a 
prorated share of the tax levy on the property in the TRA.  Tax rates may vary from TRA to TRA within 
the State, within a community, and within a redevelopment project area.  The tax rate within a TRA is 
determined based on the general tax rate of $1.00 per $100 of taxable value, as determined by Article 
XIIIA  of  the  California  Constitution  (the  (cid:147)General  Tax  Rate(cid:148)),  plus  a  tax  rate  approved  by  voters  or 
authorized under Article XIIIA, if any, that exceeds the General Tax Rate (the (cid:147)Override Rate(cid:148)).  The tax 
rate on unsecured property in the current fiscal year is the tax rate on secured property from the prior 
fiscal year.  The Override Rate represents that portion of the tax rate that exceeds the General Tax Rate 
and that is levied to pay for voter-approved indebtedness or contractual obligations that existed prior to 
the enactment  of  Article XIIIA.    The  California  Constitution  prohibits the  allocation to redevelopment 
agencies of tax revenues derived from Override Rates levied for repayment of indebtedness approved by 
the  voters  after  December  31,  1988.    Override  Rates  typically  decline  each  year  as  a  result  of 
(1) increasing property values (which would reduce the Override Rate that must be levied to meet the 
applicable debt service) and (2) the eventual retirement of the applicable debt. 

 
Tax Rates in Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.  The Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area 
includes a total of eight TRAs.  All of the TRAs in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area include a 
pre-1989 Override Rate of 0.049469 per $100 to pay for voter-approved debt issued by the Kern County 
Water Agency.  All of the TRAs in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area also include Override Rates 
for  voter-approved  debt  issued  after  1988  by  various  school  districts,  the  levy  of  which  does  not 
contribute revenue to the Agency.  The secured tax rate for fiscal year 2008-09 is the same for all TRAs 
in the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area, and is described in the following table:

Tax Sharing Obligations in the Project Areas 

The Old Town Kern-Pioneer Redevelopment Plan and the Southeast Redevelopment Plan were 
adopted after January 1, 1994, and are therefore subject to the statutory tax sharing payments mandated 
under Section 33607.5 of the Law ((cid:147)Section 33607.5(cid:148)).  Pursuant to Section 33607.5, a prescribed portion 
of  the  Tax  Increment  Revenues  attributable  to  each  such  Project  Area  must  be  shared  with  all  of  the 
Taxing Agencies in each such Project Area.  The portion of such Tax Increment Revenues that must be 
shared  with  such  Taxing  Agencies  is  determined  based  on  three  tiers,  as  described  below.    See  also 
(cid:147)LIMITATIONS ON TAX INCREMENT REVENUES.(cid:148) 

The first tier tax sharing payment amount is 25% of the Agency(cid:146)s gross tax increment for the Old 
Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area and the Southeast Project Area, as applicable, net of the Housing Set-
Aside Revenues.  The City may elect to receive its share of such first tier of tax sharing payments.  If the 
City does not elect to receive its share, the Agency retains such amount. 

The  second  tier  tax  sharing  payment  amount  is  21%  of  the  gross  tax  increment,  net  of  the 
Housing Set-Aside Revenues, which tax increment is derived from the assessed value of the property in 
the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area and the Southeast Project Area, as applicable, in excess of the 
assessed value of such property in the 10th year after the Agency first received tax increment attributable 
to such Project Area.  The City may not receive a share of the second tier tax-sharing payments. 

The third tier tax sharing payment amount is 14% of the tax increment, net of the Housing Set-
Aside Revenues, which tax increment is derived from the assessed value of property in the Old Town 
Kern-Pioneer Project Area and the Southeast Project Area, as applicable, in excess of the assessed value 
of such property in the 30th year after the Agency first received tax increment attributable to such Project 
Area.  The City may not receive a share of the third tier tax-sharing payments. 

Proposed Facilities to be Financed with Bond Proceeds 

The Agency intends to utilize a portion of the proceeds from the sale of each series of Bonds to 
finance various infrastructure improvements in the Project Areas.  The Agency currently expects that such 
improvements  will  be  comprised  primarily  of  the  Facilities.    See  (cid:147)FACILITIES  TO  BE  FINANCED 
WITH BOND PROCEEDS.(cid:148)

HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED TAX INCREMENT REVENUES  

Historical Tax Increment Revenues 

The  Agency  currently  does  not  maintain  records  of  the  cumulative  amount  of  Tax  Increment 
Revenues  generated  by  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area  and  the  Southeast  Project  Area.    In 
addition, the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Redevelopment Plan and the Southeast Redevelopment Plan were 
both adopted after January 1, 1994, and are therefore not required to establish limits on the amount of tax 
increment  that  may  be  allocated.    See  (cid:147)LIMITATIONS  ON  TAX  INCREMENT  REVENUES  (cid:150) 
Redevelopment Plan Limitations.(cid:148) 

The following tables detail the historical Tax Increment Revenues generated within the Old Town 

Kern-Pioneer Project Area from fiscal year 2003-04 through fiscal year 2007-08.

improvements have been completed, and construction of the improvements is expected to commence in the 
second quarter of 2009. 

LIMITATIONS ON TAX INCREMENT REVENUES 

Property Tax Limitations - Article XIIIA 

On  June  6,  1978,  California  voters  approved  an  amendment  (commonly  known  as  both 
Proposition 13  and  the  Jarvis-Gann  Initiative)  to  the  California  Constitution.    Such  amendment,  which 
added  Article  XIIIA  to  the  California  Constitution,  among  other  things,  affects  the  valuation  of  real 
property for the purpose of taxation in that it defines the full cash value of property to mean (cid:147)the county 
assessor(cid:146)s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975/76 tax bill under full cash value, or thereafter, 
the  appraised  value of real  property  when  purchased,  newly  constructed,  or a change  in ownership  has 
occurred after the 1975 assessment.(cid:148)  The full cash value may be adjusted annually to reflect inflation at a 
rate not to exceed 2% per year, or any reduction in the consumer price index or comparable local data, or 
any  reduction  in  the  event  of  declining  property  value  caused  by  damage,  destruction  or  other  factors.  
Article XIIIA further limits the amount of any ad valorem tax on real property to 1% of the full cash value 
except that the 1% limitation does not apply to ad valorem taxes to pay interest or redemption charges on 

43 

 

(1) indebtedness  approved  by  the  voters  prior  to  July  1,  1978,  (2) any  bonded  indebtedness  for  the 
acquisition or improvement of real property approved on or after July 1, 1978, by two-thirds of the votes 
cast by the voters voting on the proposition, or (3) bonded indebtedness incurred by a school district or 
community  college  district  for  the  construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,  or  replacement  of  school 
facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities, approved by 55% of the voters of 
the  district  voting  on  the  proposition,  but  only  if  certain  accountability  measures  are  included  in  the 
proposition. 

In  the  general  election  held  November  4,  1986,  voters  of the  State  of  California  approved two 
measures:    Propositions 58  and  Proposition 60,  which  further  amended  Article  XIIIA.    Proposition 58 
amended Article XIIIA to provide that the terms (cid:147)purchased(cid:148) and (cid:147)change of ownership,(cid:148) for purposes of 
determining full cash value of property under Article XIIIA, do not include the purchase or transfer of 
(1) real property between spouses and (2) the principal residence and the first $1,000,000 of other property 
between parents and children. 

Proposition 60 amended Article XIIIA to permit the Legislature to allow persons over age 55 who 
sell their residence to buy or build another of equal or lesser value within two years in the same county, to 
transfer the old residence(cid:146)s assessed value to the new residence.  Under Proposition 60, the Legislature has 
enacted legislation permitting counties to implement the provisions of Proposition 60. 

Challenges to Article XIIIA 

There have been many challenges to Article XIIIA of the California Constitution.  In 1992, the 
United States Supreme Court heard the appeal in Nordlinger v. Hahn, a challenge relating to residential 
property.    Based  on  the  facts  presented  in  Nordlinger,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  held  that  the 
method  of  property  tax  assessment  under  Article  XIIIA  did  not  violate  the  federal  Constitution.    The 
Agency cannot predict whether there will be any future challenges to California(cid:146)s present system of 
property  tax  assessment  and  cannot  evaluate  the  ultimate  effect  on  the  Agency(cid:146)s  receipt  of  tax 
increment should a future decision hold unconstitutional the method of assessing property. 

Legislation Affecting Apportionment of Property Taxes 

The apportionment of property taxes in fiscal years after 1978-79 has been revised pursuant to 
Chapter  282  of  the  California  Statutes  of  1979  ((cid:147)Chapter  282(cid:148)),  which  provides  relief  funds  from 
State  moneys  beginning  in  fiscal  year  1978-79  and  is  designed  to  provide  a  permanent  system  for 
sharing  State  taxes  and  budget  surplus  funds  with  local  agencies.  Under  Chapter  282,  cities  and 
counties  receive  about  one-third  more  of  the  remaining  property  tax  revenues  collected  under 
Proposition 13 instead of direct State aid.  School districts receive a correspondingly reduced amount of 
property taxes, but receive compensation directly from the State and are given additional relief. 

Future  assessed  valuation  growth  allowed  under  Article  XIIIA  (new  construction,  change  of 
ownership, 2% annual value growth) will be allocated on the basis of (cid:147)situs(cid:148) among the jurisdictions that 
serve  the  TRA  within  which  the  growth  occurs,  except  for  certain  utility  property  assessed  by  the 
California State Board of Equalization ((cid:147)SBE(cid:148)), which is allocated by a different method discussed herein. 

Property Tax Collection Procedures 

Classifications.    In  California,  property  that  is  subject  to  ad  valorem  taxes  is  classified  as 
(cid:147)secured(cid:148) or (cid:147)unsecured.(cid:148)  Secured and unsecured property is entered on separate parts of the assessment 
roll  maintained  by  the  county  assessor.    The  secured  classification  includes  property  on  which  any 
property  tax levied by the county becomes a lien on that  property sufficient, in  the  opinion  of the 
county assessor, to secure payment of the taxes.  Every tax that becomes a lien on secured property has 

44 

 

priority over all other liens on the secured property, regardless of the time of the creation of other liens.  A 
tax levied on unsecured property does not become a lien against unsecured property, but may become a 
lien on certain other property owned by the taxpayer. 

Collections.    The  method  of  collecting  delinquent  taxes  is  substantially  different  for  the  two 
classifications of property.  The taxing authority has four ways of collecting unsecured property taxes in 
the  absence  of  timely  payment  by  the  taxpayer:  (1) a  civil  action  against  the  taxpayer;  (2) filing  a 
certificate in the office of the county clerk specifying certain facts in order to obtain a judgment lien on 
certain property of the taxpayer; (3) filing a certificate of delinquency for record in the county recorder(cid:146)s 
office, in order to obtain a lien on certain property of the taxpayer; and (4) seizure and sale of the personal 
property,  improvements,  or  possessory  interests  belonging  or  assessed  to  the  assessee.    The  exclusive 
means of enforcing the payment of delinquent taxes with respect to property on the secured roll is the sale 
of property securing the taxes to the State for the amount of taxes that are delinquent. 

Penalties.  A 10% penalty is added to delinquent taxes that have been levied with respect to 
property on the secured roll.  In addition, property on the secured roll on which taxes are delinquent is 
declared in default on or about June 30 of the fiscal year.  Such property may thereafter be redeemed 
by  payment of  the  delinquent taxes  and  a delinquency  penalty,  plus  a redemption penalty  of  1.5%  per 
month to the time of redemption and a $15 Redemption Fee.  If taxes are unpaid for a period of five years 
or  more,  the  property  is  recorded  in  a  (cid:147)Power  to  Sell(cid:148)  status  and  is  subject  to  sale  by  the  county  tax 
collector.  A 10% penalty also applies to the delinquent taxes on property on the unsecured roll and, further, 
an additional penalty of 1.5% per month accrues with respect to such taxes beginning the first day of the 
third month following the delinquency date. 

Delinquencies.    The  valuation  of  property  is  determined  as  of  January  1  each  year  and  equal 
installments of taxes levied on secured property become delinquent on the following December 10 and 
April 10.  Taxes on unsecured property are due January 1.  Unsecured taxes enrolled by July 31, if unpaid, 
are  delinquent  August  31  at  5:00  p.m.  and  are  subject  to  penalty;  unsecured  taxes  added  to  roll  after 
July 31, if unpaid, are delinquent on the last day of the month succeeding the month of enrollment. 

Supplemental  Assessments.    Senate  Bill  No.  813  (Chapter  498,  California  Statutes  of  1983) 
((cid:147)SB 813(cid:148)), provided for the supplemental assessment and taxation of property as of the occurrence of a 
change  in  ownership  or  completion  of  new  construction.    SB  813  may  provide  increased  revenue  to 
redevelopment  agencies  to  the  extent  that  supplemental  assessments  as  a  result  of  new  construction  or 
changes of ownership occur within the boundaries of redevelopment projects subsequent to the lien date.  
Supplemental assessments have not been included in any of the projections of Tax Increment Revenues 
included in this Official Statement.  To the extent such supplemental assessments occur within a Project 
Area, applicable Tax Increment Revenues may increase. 

Tax  Collection  Fees.    Senate  Bill  No.  2557  (Chapter  466,  California  Statutes  of  1990) 
((cid:147)SB 2557(cid:148))  authorizes  county  auditors  to  determine  property  tax  administration  costs  proportionately 
attributable to local jurisdictions and to submit invoices to the jurisdictions for such costs.  Subsequent 
legislation specifically includes redevelopment agencies among the entities that are subject to a property 
tax  administration  charge.    Such  costs  are  deducted  prior  to  a  determination  of  tax  increment  for  each 
Project Area, which tax increment is used to determine (i) the Net Tax Increment Revenues for the Old 
Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area, which are pledged, and which constitute the primary source of funds, to 
pay debt service on the Series 2009A Bonds, and (ii) the Net Tax Increment Revenues for the Southeast 
Project Area, which are pledged, and which constitute the primary source of funds to pay debt service on 
the Series 2009B Bonds.  The County(cid:146)s administrative charges for each Project Area for fiscal year 2007-
08 were as follows:  (a) $55,421 for the Southeast Project Area, which amount was 1.28% of the Southeast 
Project Area(cid:146)s gross tax increment; and (b) $31,871 for the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area, which 
amount  was  1.28%  of  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area(cid:146)s  gross  tax  increment.    The  County(cid:146)s 

45 

 

administrative charges for each Project Area for fiscal year 2008-09 are not yet available.  The County(cid:146)s 
administrative charges for each Project Area for fiscal year 2008-09 and for all subsequent fiscal years, as 
reflected  in  the  projections  contained  herein,  have  been  estimated  at  1.25%  of  gross  applicable  tax 
increment  for  the  applicable  Project  Area.    See  also  (cid:147)HISTORICAL  AND  PROJECTED  TAX 
INCREMENT REVENUES.(cid:148) 

Allocation of Tax Increment to Agency.  It is the practice of the Auditor-Controller to allocate 
to redevelopment agencies, including the Agency, 100% of the tax increment projected by the equalized 
tax roll, without regard to collections, cancellations, or refunds.  Consequently, the tax increment 
received by the Agency each fiscal year is not subject to revenue loss due to delinquencies or gains due 
to  redemptions.    The  Auditor-Controller  currently  allocates  such  tax  increment  to  redevelopment 
agencies, including the Agency, as follows:  in December of each year, the Auditor-Controller allocates 
approximately 50% of projected tax increment to the redevelopment agencies; in April of each year, the 
Auditor-Controller  allocates  the  remaining  50%  of  projected  tax  increment  to  the  redevelopment 
agencies;  the  Auditor-Controller  allocates  supplemental  tax  increment  (derived  from  a  reassessment  of 
property  due to a change  of ownership or completion  of  new  construction)  to the redevelopment 
agencies based on collections on a monthly basis beginning in November and continuing through July of 
each fiscal year.  Such administrative practices of the Auditor-Controller are subject to change without 
notice and no assurance can be made that such administrative practice will continue. 

Tax Rates 

Tax  rates  vary  from  area  to  area  within  the  State,  as  well  as  within  a  community  and  a 
redevelopment project area.  The tax rate for any particular parcel is based on the jurisdictions levying the 
tax rate for the area in which the parcel is located.  A tax rate consists of the General Tax Rate of $1.00 
per $100 of taxable value, as determined by Article XIIIA of the California Constitution, plus an Override 
Rate  approved by voters or authorized under Article XIIIA, if any, that exceeds the General Tax Rate.  
For a discussion of the tax rates applicable to the Project Area, see (cid:147)THE PROJECT AREAS (cid:150) Tax Rates 
in Project Areas.(cid:148) 

Appropriations Limitations - Article XIIIB 

On  November  6,  1979,  California  voters  approved Proposition 4, the  so-called  Gann  Initiative, 
which added Article XIIIB to the California Constitution.  The principal effect of Article XIIIB is to limit 
the  annual  appropriations  of  the  State  and  any  city,  county,  school  district,  authority,  or  other 
political subdivision of the State to the level of appropriations for the prior fiscal year, as adjusted for 
changes in the cost of living, population, and services rendered by the government entity. 

Effective  November  30,  1980,  the  California  Legislature  added  Section 33678  to  the  Law, 
which provides that the allocation of taxes to a redevelopment agency for the purpose of paying principal 
of,  or  interest  on,  loans,  advances,  or  indebtedness  will  not  be  deemed  the  receipt  by  such  agency  of 
proceeds of taxes levied by or on behalf of the agency within the meaning of Article XIIIB, nor will 
such portion of taxes be deemed receipt of taxes by, or an appropriation subject to the limitation of, any 
other  public  body  within  the  meaning  or  for  the  purpose  of  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  State, 
including Section 33678 of the Law. 

Proposition 87 

Under prior State law, if a taxing entity increased its tax rate to obtain revenues to repay voter 
approved  general  obligation  bonds,  any  redevelopment  project  area  that  included  property 
affected by the tax rate increase would realize a proportionate increase in tax increment. 

46 

 

Proposition 87, approved by voters of the State on November 8, 1993, requires that all revenues 
produced by a tax rate increase (approved by the voters on or after January 1, 1989) go directly to the 
taxing entity that increases the tax rate to repay the general obligation bonded indebtedness.  As a result, 
redevelopment agencies no longer receive an increase in tax increment when taxes on property in the 
project area are increased to repay voter-approved general obligation debt. 

Proposition 218 

On November 5, 1996, California voters approved Proposition 218, the self-titled (cid:147)Right to Vote 
on  Taxes  Act.(cid:148)    Proposition  218  added  Articles  XIIIC  and  XIIID  to  the  California  Constitution, 
imposing certain vote requirements and other limitations on the imposition of new or increased taxes, 
assessments, and property-related fees and charges.  Net Tax Increment Revenues from the Old Town 
Kern-Pioneer Project Area securing the Series 2009A Bonds, and Net Tax Increment Revenues from the 
Southeast Project Area securing the Series 2009B Bonds, are all derived from property taxes, which are 
outside the scope of taxes, assessments, and property-related fees and charges that were limited by 
Proposition 218. 

AB 1290 

In 1993, the California Legislature enacted Assembly Bill 1290 (Chapter 942, California Statutes 
of 1993) ((cid:147)AB 1290(cid:148)), which contained several significant changes in the Law.  Among the changes made 
by AB 1290 was a provision that limits the period of time for incurring and repaying loans, advances, and 
indebtedness payable from tax increment.  In general, a redevelopment plan adopted prior to January 1, 
1994, may terminate not more than 40 years following the date of original adoption, and loans, advances, 
and indebtedness may be repaid during a period extending not more than 10 years following the date of 
termination of the redevelopment plan. 

The Agency believes that the Redevelopment Plans are all in compliance with AB 1290.  See 

(cid:147)LIMITATIONS ON TAX INCREMENT REVENUES (cid:150) Redevelopment Plan Limitations.(cid:148) 

SB 211 

In 2001, the California Legislature enacted Senate Bill 211 (Chapter 741, California Statutes of 
2001) ((cid:147)SB 211(cid:148)).  Among other things, SB 211 provided California cities with the authority to eliminate, 
by  ordinance,  the  time  limit  to  establish  indebtedness  in  redevelopment  project  areas  adopted  prior  to 
January 1, 1994.  If a redevelopment plan is so amended, SB 211 further provides that any existing tax 
sharing agreements shall continue and that certain statutory tax sharing arrangements for entities without 
tax sharing agreements will commence in the year the eliminated limit would have taken effect.  SB 211 
also provided that a city may extend the time limit for the effectiveness of a redevelopment plan and the 
repayment  of  debt  for  up  to  ten  years  if  it  can  make  certain  specified  findings.    The  Old  Town  Kern-
Pioneer  Project  Area  and  the  Southeast  Project  Area  were  both  adopted  after  January  1,  1994,  and, 
therefore, neither Project Area is subject to the provisions of SB 211. 

Future Initiatives 

Article XIIIA, Article XIIIB, and certain other propositions affecting property tax levies were 
each adopted as measures that qualified for the ballot pursuant to California(cid:146)s initiative process.  From 
time  to  time  other  initiative  measures  could  be  adopted,  further  affecting  Agency  revenues  or  the 
Agency(cid:146)s ability to expend revenues. 

47 

 

Low and Moderate Income Housing 

Chapter  1337,  California  Statutes  of  1976,  added  Sections 33334.2  and  33334.3  to  the  Law 
requiring  redevelopment  agencies  to  set  aside  20%  of  all  tax  increment  allocated  to  redevelopment 
agencies  from  redevelopment  project  areas  adopted  after  December 31, 1976,  in  a  low-  and  moderate-
income  housing  fund  to  be  expended  for  authorized  low-  and  moderate-income  housing  purposes.  
Amounts  on  deposit  in  the  low-  and  moderate-income  housing  fund  may  also  be  applied  to  pay  debt 
service on bonds, loans, or advances of redevelopment agencies to provide financing for such low- and 
moderate-income housing purposes.  Each of the Project Areas is subject to the 20% set-aside requirement 
for low- and moderate-income housing. 

Statement of Indebtedness 

Under the Law, the Agency must file with the Auditor-Controller a statement of indebtedness for 
each Project Area by October 1 of each year.  As described below, such statements of indebtedness affect 
the amount of Tax Increment Revenues derived from the Project Areas that will be paid to the Agency in 
each fiscal year. 

Each statement of indebtedness is filed on a form prescribed by the State Controller and specifies, 
among  other  things:  (i) the  total  amount  of  principal  and  interest  payable  on  all  loans,  advances,  or 
indebtedness  (including  each  series  of  Bonds  and  all  Additional  Bonds)  in  each  Project  Area,  as 
applicable (the (cid:147)Debt(cid:148)), both over the life of the Debt and for the current fiscal year, and (ii) the amount 
of Available Revenue (as defined below) with respect each Project Area as of the end of the previous 
fiscal year. 

(cid:147)Available  Revenue(cid:148)  is  calculated  by  subtracting  the  total  payments  on  Debt  related  to  the 
applicable Project Area during the previous fiscal year from the total revenues (both tax increment and 
other revenues) related to such Project Area received during the previous fiscal year, plus any carry-
forward  from  the  prior  fiscal  year.    Available  Revenue  includes  amounts  held  by  the  Agency  and 
irrevocably pledged to the payment of Debt relating to such Project Area other than amounts set aside for 
low- and moderate-income housing. 

The Auditor-Controller may only pay tax increment related to a Project Area to the Agency in any 
fiscal year to the extent that the total remaining principal and interest on all applicable Debt exceeds the 
amount of Available Revenue as shown on the statement of indebtedness. 

The statement of indebtedness constitutes prima facie evidence of the indebtedness of the Agency; 
however,  the  Auditor-Controller  may  dispute  the  statement  of  indebtedness  in  certain  cases.  
Section 33675  of  the  Law  provides  for  certain  time  limits  controlling  any  dispute  of  the  statement  of 
indebtedness,  and  allows  for  California  Superior  Court  determination  of  such  dispute  if  it  cannot  be 
resolved by the Agency and the County.  Any such action may only challenge the amount of the Debt as 
shown on the statement, and not the validity of any Debt or its related contracts or expenditures.  No 
challenge can be made to payments to a trustee in connection with a bond issue or payments to a public 
agency in connection with payments by that public agency with respect to a lease or bond issue. 

AB 1389 Filings 

On  September  30,  2008,  the  California  Legislature  adopted  Assembly  Bill  1389  ((cid:147)AB  1389(cid:148)), 
which, among other things, requires redevelopment agencies to report their statutory payments pursuant to 
AB 1290 and SB 211, by each project area and for each taxing agency, to their respective county auditors.  
Such reports are required to include such data for each of the five fiscal years from 2003-04 through 2007-
08 by October 1, 2008, and annually by October 1 for the following six years.  Failure to make such filing 

48 

 

in accordance with AB 1389 may subject a redevelopment agency to financial penalties.  The Agency has 
filed all its necessary AB 1389 filings as of the date of this Official Statement. 

AB 1389 also requires redevelopment agencies to shift approximately $350 million in property tax 
revenues to the respective county ERAFs (as defined herein) prior to May 10, 2009, for fiscal year 2008-
09.  See (cid:147)RISK FACTORS - State Budget and ERAF Shift.(cid:148) 

Redevelopment Plan Limitations 

Section 33333.2 of the Law requires that, for redevelopment plans adopted on or after January 1, 
1994,  each  redevelopment  agency  must  include  in  each  redevelopment  plan  certain  limitations.    These 
include a time limitation on the effectiveness of the redevelopment plan that is not to exceed 30 years from 
the  date  of  adoption  of  the  redevelopment  plan  or,  in  the  case  of  territories  added  to  an  existing 
redevelopment plan, the date that said added territory was adopted.  Section 33333.2 further requires such 
redevelopment plans to limit the establishment of loans, advances, and indebtedness to be paid from tax 
revenues to 20 years from the date of the plan adoption or from the date of the addition of added territory.  
The redevelopment plan must limit the repayment of indebtedness to 45 years from the date of adoption or 
addition of added territory and limit commencement of eminent domain proceedings to 12 years from the 
date of adoption or addition of added territory. 

In 2003, the State Legislature enacted Senate Bill 1045 (Chapter 260, California Statutes of 2003) 
((cid:147)SB 1045(cid:148)), which effected several amendments to the Law.  Among other things, SB 1045 provided a 
simplified  methodology  for  extending  the  length  of  time  within  which  the  Agency  may  repay 
indebtedness with tax increment.  See (cid:147)THE PROJECT AREAS (cid:150) Redevelopment Plan Limitations.(cid:148) 

Statutory Pass-Throughs 

Pass-through payments to Taxing Agencies are made in accordance with the following formulas 

pursuant to Section 33607.5, which was enacted pursuant to AB 1290: 

(a)  20% of gross tax increment (or 25% of revenue after deduction for the required low- and 
moderate-income  housing  set-aside)  is  to  be  allocated  to  the  Taxing  Agencies  for  the  first  fiscal  year 
through the last fiscal year for which the Project Area receives tax increment; 

(b)  an additional 16.8% of the gross tax increment (or 21% after deduction for required the low- 
and moderate-income housing set-aside) is to be allocated to the Taxing Agencies from the 11th through the 
last fiscal year, based on the increase in assessed value over the project area assessed value in the 10th fiscal 
year; and 

(c)  an additional 11.2% of the gross tax increment (14% after deduction for the required low- and 
moderate-income housing set-aside) is to be allocated to the Taxing Agencies from the 31st through 
the last fiscal year, based on the increase in assessed value over the project area assessed value in the 30th 
fiscal year. 

The  payments  to  the  affected  Taxing  Agencies  are  allocated  between  each  Taxing  Agency  in 
proportion to the share of property taxes each such Taxing Agency receives in the year funds are allocated.  
Statutory tax sharing payments made pursuant to Section 33607.5 within the applicable Project Area 
began  with  the  first  fiscal  year  for  which  they  were  allocated  tax  increment.    Such  pass-through 
payments have been taken into account by the Fiscal Consultant for purposes of projecting the amount of 
Tax Increment Revenues in this Official Statement. 

49 

 

Section 33607.5(e)  of  the  Law  specifies  a  procedure  whereby  the  Agency  may  request 
subordination of the statutory tax sharing payments to payment of debt service on the Bonds by all of the 
Taxing Agencies in the Project Areas, as applicable.  As part of this request, the Agency must provide 
substantial evidence to the Taxing Agencies that it will have sufficient funds to make the debt service 
payments  on  the  Bonds  as  well  as  making  the  required  statutory  tax  sharing  payments.    The  Taxing 
Agencies may respond and agree to the subordination request, they may do nothing and after 45 days be 
deemed to have agreed to the subordination, or they may disapprove the subordination request.  A Taxing 
Agency may disapprove a subordination request only if it believes based on substantial evidence that the 
Agency(cid:146)s financial estimates are incorrect and that the Agency will not be able to make debt service and 
the tax sharing payments.  The Agency does not believe that subordination of the statutory tax sharing 
payments  by  the  applicable  Taxing  Agencies  is  required  in  connection  with  the  Bonds,  and  has  not 
requested such subordination from any such Taxing Agency. 

Assessment Appeals 

Under Section 51(b) of the California Revenue and Taxation Code ((cid:147)Section 51(b)(cid:148)), the assessor 
may place a value on the tax roll lower than the compounded base assessment value if the full cash value 
of  real  property  has  been  reduced  by  damage,  destruction,  depreciation,  obsolescence,  removal  of 
property,  or  other  factors  causing  a  decline  in  the  value.  Reductions  in  value  under  Section 51(b), 
commonly  referred  to  as  (cid:147)Proposition  8  appeals,(cid:148)  can  be  achieved  either  by  formal  appeal  or 
administratively by assessor staff appraising the property.  A reduced full cash value placed on the tax roll 
does not change the base assessment value.  The future impact of a parcel subject to a Proposition 8 
appeal  is  dependent  upon  a  change  in  the  conditions that caused the drop in value.  In fiscal years 
following a successful Proposition 8 appeal, the assessor may determine that the value of the property 
has increased as a result of corrective actions or improved market conditions and enroll a value on the 
tax  roll  up  to  the  parcel(cid:146)s  compounded  base  assessment  value.    Additionally,  successful  appeals 
regarding property on the unsecured rolls does not necessarily affect the valuation of such property in 
any succeeding fiscal year. 

An assessee of locally assessed or state-assessed property may contest the taxable value enrolled 
by the county assessor or by the SBE, respectively.  The assessee of SBE-assessed property or locally-
assessed personal property, the valuation of which is subject to annual reappraisal, actually contests the 
determination  of  the  full  cash  value  of  property  when  filing  an  assessment  appeal.    Because  of  the 
limitations to the determination of the full cash value of locally assessed real property by Article XIIIA, 
an  assessee  of  locally  assessed  real  property  generally  contests  the  original  determination  of  the  base 
assessment value of the parcel, i.e., the value assigned after a change of ownership or completion of new 
construction.  In addition, the assessee of locally assessed real property may contest the current assessment 
value  (the  base  assessment  value  plus  the  compounded  annual  inflation  factor)  when  specified 
conditions have caused the full cash value to drop below the current assessment value. 

At the time of reassessment, after a change of ownership or completion of new construction, the 
assessee may appeal the base assessment value of the property.  Under an appeal of a base assessment 
value,  the  assessee  appeals  the  actual  underlying  market  value  of  the  sale  transaction  or  the  recently 
completed  improvement.    A  base  assessment  appeal  has  significant  future  revenue  impact  because  a 
reduced  base  year  assessment  will  then  reduce  the  compounded  value  of  the  property  prospectively.  
Except for the 2% inflation factor allowable under Article XIIIA, the value of the property cannot be 
increased until a change of ownership occurs or additional improvements are added. 

Utility companies and railroads may contest the taxable value of utility property to the SBE.  
Generally, the impact of utility appeals is on the State-wide value of a utility determined by SBE.  As a 
result, the successful appeal of a utility may not impact the taxable value of a project area but could impact 
a project area(cid:146)s allocation of unitary property taxes. 

50 

 

The  actual  impact  to  tax  increment  is  dependent  upon  the  actual  revised  value  of  assessments 
resulting  from  values  determined  by  the  Assessment  Appeals  Board  or  through  litigation  and  the 
ultimate  timing  of  successful  appeals.    Because  the  Auditor-Controller  adjusts  revenues  to  the 
Agency to reflect roll corrections from successful appeals, the Agency may bear the burden of appeals.  
The actual valuation impact to the Project Areas from successful assessment appeals will occur on the 
assessment roll prepared after the actual valuation reduction. 

For  information  regarding  successful  and  pending  appeals  in  the  Project  Areas,  see  (cid:147)THE 

PROJECT AREAS (cid:150) Assessment Appeals in the Project Areas.(cid:148) 

RISK FACTORS 

The following information should be considered by prospective investors in evaluating each 
series of Bonds.  However, the following does not purport to be an exhaustive listing of risks and other 
considerations that may be relevant to investing in the Bonds of any series.  In addition, the order in 
which the following information is presented is not intended to reflect the relative importance of these 
risks. 

Loss of Tax Exemption on Series 2009A Bonds and Series 2009B Bonds 

As discussed under the caption (cid:147)TAX MATTERS,(cid:148) in order to maintain the exclusion from gross 
income for federal income tax purposes of the interest on the Series 2009A Bonds and the Series 2009B 
Bonds,  the  Agency  has  covenanted  in  the  Series  2009A  Indenture  and  the  Series  2009B  Indenture, 
respectively, not to take any action, or fail to take any action, if such action or failure to take such action 
would adversely affect the exclusion from gross income of interest on the Series 2009A Bonds or the 
Series 2009B Bonds, as applicable, under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 
(the (cid:147)Code(cid:148)).  In addition, the Agency has covenanted under the Series 2009A Indenture and the Series 
2009B Indenture, respectively, not to take any action, or fail to take any action, if such action or failure to 
take such action would adversely affect the exclusion from gross income of interest on any of the Series 
2009A Bonds or the Series 2009B Bonds, as applicable, under Section 103 of the Code.  Interest on the 
Series 2009A Bonds or the Series 2009B Bonds could become includable in gross income for purposes of 
federal income taxation retroactive to the date the Series 2009A Bonds or the Series 2009B Bonds, as 
applicable, were issued as a result of acts or omissions of the Agency in violation of the Code.  Should 
such an event of taxability occur with respect to either such series of Bonds, neither the Series 2009A 
Bonds  nor  Series  2009B  Bonds  are  subject  to  acceleration  or  early  redemption  and  will  remain 
outstanding to maturity. 

The Bonds are Limited Obligations 

The Bonds of each series are limited obligations of the Agency payable solely from and secured 
solely by the amounts pledged therefor under the applicable Indenture, which amounts are comprised of 
Net Tax Increment Revenues generated within the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area or the Southeast 
Project Area, as applicable, and moneys held in certain of the funds established under such applicable 
Indenture.  There is no guaranty that the amount of annual Net Tax Increment Revenues or that are 
collected by the Agency will be sufficient to pay principal of and interest on the applicable series of 
Bonds. 
Parity Debt 

The Agency may issue other bonds or incur other obligations payable from Net Tax Increment 
Revenues generated within the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area on a parity with the Series 2009A 

51 

 

Bonds,  provided  that  the  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Series  2009A  Indenture  and  the  CIEDB  Loan 
Agreement are met.  See (cid:147)SECURITY FOR SERIES 2009A BONDS (cid:150) Issuance of Additional Bonds.(cid:148)  
The Agency has previously entered into the CIEDB Loan Agreement, pursuant to which CIEDB made the 
CIEDB Loan to the Agency in the amount of $10,000,000, the repayment of which bears interest at a tax-
exempt rate of 3.11% per annum.  Pursuant to the CIEDB Loan Agreement, repayment of the CIEDB 
Loan is secured by Net Tax Increment Revenues generated within the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project 
Area on a parity with the Series 2009A Bonds.  Any debt issued by the Agency on a parity with the Series 
2009A  Bonds,  including  the  CIEDB  Loan,  necessarily  limits  the  availability  of  Net  Tax  Increment 
Revenues generated within the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area.  Notwithstanding the Tax Increment 
Revenues  generated  within  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area,  pursuant  to  the  Series  2009A 
Indenture,  Owners  of  the  Series  2009A  Bonds  are  not  guaranteed  that  sufficient  Net  Tax  Increment 
Revenues generated within the Old Town Kern-Pioneer Project Area will be available to pay debt service 
on the Series 2009A Bonds.  See (cid:147)SECURITY FOR SERIES 2009A BONDS(cid:148) and (cid:147)HISTORICAL AND 
PROJECTED TAX INCREMENT REVENUES.(cid:148) 

The Agency may issue other bonds or incur other obligations payable from Net Tax Increment 
Revenues generated within the Southeast Project Area on a parity with the Series 2009B Bonds, provided 
that  the  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Series  2009B  Indenture  are  met.    See  (cid:147)SECURITY  FOR  SERIES 
2009B BONDS (cid:150) Issuance of Additional Bonds.(cid:148) Any debt issued by the Agency on a parity with the 
Series 2009B Bonds necessarily limits the availability of Net Tax Increment Revenues generated within 
the Southeast Project Area.  Notwithstanding the Tax Increment Revenues generated within the Southeast 
Project  Area,  pursuant  to  the  Series  2009B  Indenture,  Owners  of  the  Series  2009B  Bonds  are  not 
guaranteed that sufficient Net Tax Increment Revenues generated within the Southeast Project Area will 
be  available  to  pay  debt  service  on  the  Series  2009B  Bonds.    See  (cid:147)SECURITY  FOR  SERIES  2009B 
BONDS(cid:148) and (cid:147)HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED TAX INCREMENT REVENUES.(cid:148) 

Senior Debt 

The Agency has heretofore entered into HUD Loan No. 1, the repayment of which is secured by a 
lien  on  Tax  Increment  Revenues  generated  within  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area  that  is 
superior to the lien that secures the repayment of the Series 2009A Bonds and the CIEDB Loan.  See 
(cid:147)SECURITY  FOR  SERIES  2009A  BONDS  (cid:150)  Outstanding  Senior  Debt  (cid:150)  Series  2009A  Bonds(cid:148)  and 
(cid:147)HISTORICAL  AND  PROJECTED  TAX  INCREMENT  REVENUES  (cid:150)  Projected  Net  Tax  Increment 
Revenues and Debt Service Coverage for Series 2009A Bonds.(cid:148) 

The Agency has heretofore entered into HUD Loan No. 2 and HUD Loan No. 3, the repayment of 
which is secured by a lien on Tax Increment Revenues generated within the Southeast Project Area that is 
superior  to  the  lien  that  secures  the  repayment  of  the  Series  2009B  Bonds.    See  (cid:147)SECURITY  FOR 
SERIES 2009B BONDS (cid:150) Outstanding Senior Debt (cid:150) Series 2009B Bonds(cid:148) and (cid:147)HISTORICAL AND 
PROJECTED  TAX  INCREMENT  REVENUES  (cid:150)  Projected  Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  and  Debt

Reduction of Tax Increment Revenues 

Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  generated  within  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  Area 
constitute  the  primary  security  for  the  Series  2009A  Bonds.    Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  generated 
within  the  Southeast  Project  Area  constitute  the  primary  security  for  the  Series  2009B  Bonds.    Tax 
Increment Revenues are determined based on the amount of incremental value of taxable property in the 
applicable Project Area, the current rate or rates at which property in such Project Area is taxed, and the 
percentage of taxes collected in such Project Area. 

52 

 

Several types of events beyond the control of the Agency could occur and cause a reduction in 
available  Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  that  secure  the  applicable  series  of  Bonds,  including,  among 
others, the following: (i) a reduction of taxable assessed values of property in the applicable Project Area 
caused by local or regional economic factors; (ii) a relocation out of the applicable Project Area by one or 
more major property owners; (iii) successful appeals by property owners in an applicable Project Area for 
a  reduction  in  a  property(cid:146)s  assessed  value;  (iv) a  reduction  of  the  general  inflationary  rate;  or  (v) the 
destruction  of  property  caused  by  natural  or  other  disasters.    Such  risk  increases  in  proportion  to  the 
percentage of total assessed value attributable to any single property owner in an applicable Project Area.  
For information regarding the largest property owners of each of the Project Areas, see (cid:147)THE PROJECT 
AREAS (cid:150) Major Taxpayers in the Project Areas.(cid:148) 

Reduction in Inflationary Rate 

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution provides that the full cash value base of real property 
used in determining taxable value may be adjusted from year to year to reflect the inflationary rate, not to 
exceed a 2% increase for any given year, or may be reduced to reflect a reduction in the consumer price 
index or comparable local data.  Such measure is computed on a calendar year basis. 

Because Article XIIIA limits inflationary assessed value adjustments to the lesser of the actual 
inflationary  rate  or  2%,  there  have  been  years  in  which  the  assessed  values  were  adjusted  by  actual 
inflationary rates, which were less than 2%.  Since Article XIIIA was approved, the annual adjustment for 
inflation has fallen below the 2% limitation five times:  in fiscal year 1983/84, 1%; in fiscal year 1995-96, 
1.19%; in fiscal year 1996-97, 1.11%; in fiscal year 1999/00, 1.85%; and in fiscal year 2004/05, 1.867%.  

The Agency is unable to predict if any adjustments to the full cash value base of real property 
within any of the Project Areas, whether an increase or a reduction, will be realized in the future.  In the 
event that the assessed value of real property in any of the Project Areas does not increase at the allowed 
annual  rate  of  2%,  the  Agency(cid:146)s  receipt  of  Tax  Increment  Revenues  may  be  adversely  affected.    See 
(cid:147)LIMITATIONS ON TAX INCREMENT REVENUES.(cid:148) 

Distressed  Housing Market 

From  approximately  2002  through  the  first  half  of  2006,  the  California  housing  market 
experienced accelerating demand and significant price appreciation.  One factor that contributed to the 
positive  housing  marketing  during  this  period  was  the  use  of  unconventional  mortgage  structures, 
including mortgages that bear a low initial (or (cid:147)teaser(cid:148)) fixed interest rate that converts to an adjustable 
rate after several years, and interest-only mortgages that include a balloon payment after a fixed period of 
interest-only  payments.    Many  homeowners  who  financed  the  purchase  of  their  homes  with  such 
mortgages  have  experienced  significant  increases  in  their  monthly  mortgage  payments  after  the  initial 
low-interest  period.    Some  of  these  homeowners  have  not  been  able  to  maintain  payments  on  their 
existing loans or to obtain refinancing loans for their homes.  As a result of such mortgage practices and 
other economic factors, foreclosure proceedings in California have increased dramatically since 2006, and 
the California housing market has recently experienced a significant decrease in the demand for housing 
product  and  in  home  sale  prices,  an  increase  in  new  home  inventory,  and  a  tightening  of  credit  by 
mortgage lenders.  The Agency has not undertaken to assess the financial condition of the current owners 
of the residential properties within any of the Project Areas and expresses no opinion concerning these 
matters.  The Agency cannot predict and expresses no opinion as to whether or how such factors may 
affect appeals of assessed values or delinquencies in the collection of property taxes within any of the 
Project Areas. 

53 

 

Future Initiatives, Litigation, or Changes in Law 

In  addition  to  the  existing  limitations  on  Tax  Increment  Revenues  described  herein  under 
(cid:147)LIMITATIONS  ON  TAX  INCREMENT  REVENUES,(cid:148)  the  California  electorate  could  adopt  future 
initiative measures, or the California Legislature could pass future legislation, with the effect of reducing 
Tax  Increment  Revenues  payable  to  the  Agency,  or  the  Agency(cid:146)s  ability  to  expend  tax  increment.  
Similarly,  future  federal  or  California  litigation  could  result  in  case  law  precedent  affecting  Tax 
Increment Revenues payable to the Agency, or the Agency(cid:146)s ability to expend tax increment. 

Levy and Collection of Taxes 

The Agency has no independent power to levy or collect property taxes.  Any reduction in the tax 
rate or the implementation of any constitutional or legislative property tax decrease could reduce the Tax 
Increment Revenues and, accordingly, could have an adverse impact on the ability of the Agency to pay 
principal of and interest on the applicable series of Bonds. 

Likewise, delinquencies in the payment of property taxes by the owners of land in any Project 
Area, and  the impact  of  bankruptcy  proceedings  on the  ability  of Taxing  Agencies to  collect property 
taxes on property therein, could have an adverse effect on the Agency(cid:146)s ability to make timely payments 
of debt service on the applicable series of Bonds.  Any reduction in Tax Increment Revenues, whether for 
any of the aforementioned reasons or any other reasons, could have an adverse effect on the Agency(cid:146)s 
ability to pay the principal of and interest on the applicable series of Bonds. 

Estimates of Tax Increment Revenues  

To estimate the total revenues available to pay debt service on each series of Bonds, the Agency 
has made certain assumptions with regard to the assessed valuation in each of the Project Areas, future tax 
rates, percentage of taxes collected, and the amount of funds available for investment and the interest rate 
at which those funds will be invested.  The Agency believes such assumptions to be reasonable, but to the 
extent that the assessed valuation, the tax rates, the percentage of taxes collected, the amount of the funds 
available  for  investment,  or  the  interest  rate  at  which  they  are  invested,  are  less  than  the  Agency(cid:146)s 
assumptions,  the  total  revenues  available  to  pay  debt  service  on  the  Bonds  may  be  less  than  those 
projected  in  this  Official  Statement.    See  (cid:147)HISTORICAL  AND  PROJECTED  TAX  INCREMENT 
REVENUES  (cid:150)  Projected  Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  and  Debt  Service  Coverage  for  Series  2009A 
Bonds(cid:148)  and  (cid:147)(cid:150)  Projected  Net  Tax  Increment  Revenues  and  Debt  Service  Coverage  for  Series  2009B 
Bonds.(cid:148) 

As noted above, Article XIIIA of the California Constitution provides that the full cash value base 
of  real  property  used  in  determining  taxable  value  may  be  adjusted  from  year  to  year  to  reflect  the 
inflationary rate, not to exceed a 2% increase for any given year, or may be reduced to reflect a reduction 
in the consumer price index or comparable local data.  Such adjustments are computed on a calendar year 
basis.    In  projecting  future  Tax  Increment  Revenues,  the  Agency  has  assumed  the  2%  inflationary 
increases.  However, future deflation could cause decreases in property values, a reduction in tax revenues 
received by the Agency, and a reduction in Tax Increment Revenues.  See (cid:147)SECURITY FOR SERIES 
2009A  BONDS,(cid:148)  (cid:147)SECURITY  FOR  SERIES  2009B  BONDS,(cid:148)  and  (cid:147)LIMITATIONS  ON  TAX 
INCREMENT REVENUES.(cid:148) 

Concentration of Ownership 

The assessed value of the property owned by the 10 largest taxpayers in the Southeast Project 
Area currently represents approximately 18.41% of the total assessed value in the Southeast Project Area.  
The  assessed  value  of  the  property  owned  by  the  10  largest  taxpayers  in  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer 

54 

 

Project  Area  currently  represents  approximately  14.42%  of  the  total  assessed  value  in  the  Old  Town 
Kern-Pioneer Project Area.  See (cid:147)THE PROJECT AREAS (cid:150) Major Taxpayers in the Project Areas.(cid:148) 

Events causing a reduction in assessed value of or physical damage to property in a Project Area 
owned  by  one  or  more  of  the  10  largest  property  owners  therein,  or  any  future  owner  of  significant 
property in a Project Area, such as physical damage by fire, earthquake, or other causes, may significantly 
delay  or  ultimately  reduce  the  payment  of  property  taxes  in  such  Project  Area,  which  may  affect  the 
amount or receipt of Tax Increment Revenues.  In addition, bankruptcy or financial difficulties arising 
with respect to a current or future major property owner may also significantly delay or ultimately reduce 
payment of property taxes in such Project Area. 

Failure to Develop Property 

The construction of the Facilities has not yet been completed and there are still land development 
activities occurring within the Project Areas.  Land development operations, including construction of the 
Facilities, are subject to comprehensive federal, State, and local regulations, as well as general and local 
economic  conditions.    Approval  is  required  from  various  agencies  in  connection  with  the  layout  and 
design of the Facilities, the nature and extent of the planned improvements, construction activity, land 
use, zoning, and health requirements, as well as numerous other matters.  Although many such approvals 
have been obtained, it is possible that the remaining approvals will not be obtained on a timely basis.  
Failure  to  obtain  any  such  agency  approval  or  satisfy  any  such  governmental  requirements  could 
adversely affect the construction of the Facilities.  In addition, there is a risk that future governmental 
requirements, including, but not limited to, governmental policies restricting or controlling development 
in one or more of the Project Areas, will be enacted, and a risk that future land use initiatives approved by 
the voters in the City or the State could add more restrictions and requirements on development therein.  
See (cid:145)FACILITIES TO BE FINANCED WITH BOND PROCEEDS.(cid:148) 

Natural Disasters 

The value of the property in the Project Areas in the future can be adversely affected by a variety 
of additional factors, particularly those which may affect infrastructure and other public improvements, as 
well as private improvements on property and the continued habitability and enjoyment of such private 
improvements.    Such  additional  factors  include,  without  limitation,  geologic  conditions  such  as 
earthquakes,  topographic  conditions  such  as  earth  movements,  landslides,  fire  storms  and  floods,  and 
climatic  conditions  such  as  droughts.    In  the  event  that  one  or  more  of  such  conditions  occur,  such 
occurrence could cause damages of varying seriousness to the land and improvements and the value of 
property in the Project Areas could be diminished in the aftermath of such events.  A substantial reduction 
of the value of such properties could affect the ability or willingness of the property owners to pay the 
property taxes.  The City, like most communities in California, is an area of unpredictable seismic activity 
and therefore is subject to potentially destructive earthquakes.  In addition, drought conditions in Southern 
California in recent years, combined with higher than average temperatures and Santa Ana winds, have 
created conditions that are from time to time conducive to wildfires. 

Hazardous Substances 

The  discovery  of  hazardous  substances  on  the  property  in  any  Project  Area  could  limit  the 
beneficial  use  of  taxable  property  in  such  Project  Area.    An  owner  or  operator  of  a  property  may  be 
required  by  law  to  remedy  conditions  of  the  property  relating  to  releases  or  threatened  releases  of 
hazardous  substances.    Moreover,  such  owner  or  operator  may  be  required  to  remedy  a  hazardous 
substance condition of property whether or not the owner or operator has anything to do with creating or 
handling the hazardous substance.  Should a hazardous substance affect any of the property in a Project 
Area, the effect could be to reduce the marketability and value of the property by the costs of remedying 

55 

 

the  condition  or  other  amounts.    Such  costs  could  result  in  the  reduction  in  the  assessed  value  of  the 
affected property, which could adversely affect the ability of the Agency to pay debt service with respect 
to the applicable series of Bonds. 

Bankruptcy Risks 

The enforceability of the rights and remedies of the Owners of the Bonds of each series, and the 
obligations  of  the  Agency  with  respect  thereto,  may  become  subject  to  the  following:  (i) the  federal 
bankruptcy  code  and  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium,  or  similar  laws 
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors(cid:146) rights generally, now or hereafter in effect; (ii) usual 
equitable principles which may limit the specific enforcement under state law of certain remedies; (iii) the 
exercise by the United States of America of the powers delegated to it by the federal Constitution; and 
(iv) the reasonable and necessary exercise, in certain exceptional situations, of the police power inherent 
in the sovereignty of the State and its governmental bodies in the interest of servicing a significant and 
legitimate  public  purpose.    Bankruptcy  proceedings,  or  the  exercise  of  powers  by  the  federal  or  State 
government, if initiated, could subject the owners of the Bonds to judicial discretion and interpretation of 
their  rights  in  bankruptcy  or  otherwise  and  consequently  may  entail  risks  of  delay,  limitation,  or 
modification of their rights. 

State Budget and ERAF Shift 

In connection with its approval of the State(cid:146)s annual budgets, the State Legislature has from time 
to time enacted legislation that, among other things, reallocated funds from redevelopment agencies to 
school districts by shifting a portion of each agency(cid:146)s tax increment, net of amounts due to other taxing 
agencies, into the Education Revenue Augmentation Fund ((cid:147)ERAF(cid:148)) held by the applicable county.  The 
amount  required  to  be  deposited  into  the  applicable  ERAF  by  a  redevelopment  agency  under  such 
legislation is generally apportioned among all of its redevelopment project areas on a collective basis, and 
is not allocated separately to individual project areas.  The 2004-05 State budget included a transfer by 
redevelopment  agencies  to  the  applicable  ERAFs  of $250  million  in each  of fiscal  years  2004-05  and 
2005-06.  The Agency(cid:146)s share of the shift for fiscal year 2004-05 was $248,076 and the share for fiscal 
year 2005-06 was $286,574 for all three Project Areas.  The Agency paid its fiscal year 2004-05 payment 
and its fiscal year 2005-06 payment on a timely basis.  The State(cid:146)s budgets for fiscal years 2006-07 and 
2007-08  did  not  require  ERAF  transfers  of  tax  increment  by  redevelopment  agencies.    Although  the 
State(cid:146)s  voters  approved  a  constitutional  amendment  on  the  November  2004  ballot  (the  (cid:147)Local 
Government  Initiative(cid:148)),  which  purports  to  prohibit  any  further  transfers  of  non-education  local 
government property taxes for the benefit of the State, the Local Government Initiative does not purport 
to change existing law with respect to the State(cid:146)s ability to transfer redevelopment agencies(cid:146) property tax 
revenues. 

On  September  23,  2008,  Governor  Schwarzenegger  signed  the  adopted  State  budget  for  fiscal 
year 2008-09.  On September 30, 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 1389, which, among other 
things, requires redevelopment agencies to shift approximately $350 million in property tax revenues to 
the  respective  county  ERAFs  prior  to  May  10,  2009,  for  fiscal  year  2008-09.    The  Agency(cid:146)s  ERAF 
payment for fiscal year 2008-09 is estimated to be approximately $571,840.  Similar to past ERAF shifts, 
the legislation allows the Agency to make the ERAF payment from any available source, except for low 
and moderate income housing funds held as of July 1, 2008.  The Agency has sufficient resources to make 
the 2008-09 ERAF payment without using tax increment derived from any of the Project Areas for fiscal 
year 2008-09 or future fiscal years. 

The  validity  of  AB  1389  has  been  challenged  in  litigation  pending  in  the  Superior  Court  for 
Sacramento  County,  California  Redevelopment  Association  et  al.  v.  Genest  et  al.,  Case  No.  34-2008-
00028334-CU-WM-GDS ((cid:147)CRA v. Genest(cid:148)).  This case alleges, among other things, that the duties of 

56 

 

county auditors under Health and Safety Code Sections 33685(a) and 33687(a) to deposit funds received 
from  redevelopment  agencies  in  county  ERAFs  are  inconsistent  with  various  State  and  federal 
constitutional provisions and are therefore unlawful and unenforceable.  The lawsuit argues that the State 
raids  of  redevelopment  funds  to  balance  the  State  budget  are  unconstitutional,  violating  Article  XVI, 
Section  16  of  the  California  Constitution,  which  states  that  redevelopment  funds  can  only  be  used  to 
finance redevelopment projects.  The lawsuit contended that taking redevelopment funds to balance the 
State(cid:146)s budget does not qualify as a constitutionally permitted use of tax increment.  On April 30, 2009, 
the Sacramento Superior Court ruled in favor of the petitioners, holding that petitioners are entitled to 
declaratory and injunctive relief invalidating and enjoining Health and Safety Code Section 33685.  The 
court stated that the (cid:147)distribution of contributions by RDAs to their county ERAFs ... can be expected to 
regularly result in the use of RDA(cid:146)s tax increment revenues by schools and education programs unrelated 
to the RDA(cid:146)s redevelopment projects.(cid:148)  A judgment was signed by the Sacramento Superior Court on 
May 7, 2009, forbidding any of the defendants from taking any actions to carry out or enforce any of the 
payment requirements in Health and Safety Code Sections 33685 through 33689.  Based on such ruling, 
the  Agency  did  not  pay  its  share  of  the  ERAF  payment  by  the  May  10,  2009  deadline.    The  State 
Department of Finance is the principal defendant in the lawsuit and is expected to appeal the decision.  
Neither the Agency nor the City can predict the outcome of this litigation, if appealed. 

On February 20, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger signed the adopted State budget for fiscal year 
2009-10.    The  2009-10  State  budget  does  not require  an  ERAF transfer  of tax  increment  revenues  by 
redevelopment agencies.  The Agency cannot predict, however, whether the State Legislature will enact 
further legislation in the future impacting the Agency(cid:146)s tax revenue receipts with respect to the Project 
Areas.  Given the budget issues currently faced by the State, it is possible that future budgets will include 
additional ERAF shifts or other legislation reducing the tax revenues allocated to redevelopment agencies.  
Information  about  the  State  budget  for  fiscal  year  2008-09  and  State  spending  is  available  at  various 
State-maintained websites.  Text of the State budget for fiscal year 2008-09 and the Governor(cid:146)s Proposed 
Budget  for  fiscal  year  2009-10  may  be  found  at  the  website  of  the  Department  of  Finance, 
www.dof.ca.gov.    An  analysis  of  the  current  State  budget  is  posted  by  the  Office  of  the  Legislative 
Analyst  at  www.lao.ca.gov.    In  addition,  various  State  official  statements,  many  of  which  contain  a 
summary  of  the  current  and  past  State  budgets,  may  be  found  at  the  website  of  the  State  Treasurer, 
www.treasurer.ca.gov.  None of such websites is in any way incorporated into this Official Statement, and 
the  Agency  makes  no  representation  whatsoever  as  to  the  accuracy  or  completeness  of  any  of  the 
information on such websites. 

Litigation Regarding Two Percent Limitation 

In  a  Minute  Order  issued  on  November 2, 2001,  in  County  of  Orange  v.  Orange  County 
Assessment  Appeals  Board  No. 3,  the  Orange  County  Superior  Court  held  that  the  Orange  County 
Assessor  violated  the  2%  inflation  adjustment  provision  of  Article  XIIIA  when,  in  a  case  in  which  a 
home(cid:146)s taxable value did not increase for two years due to a flat real estate market, the Assessor tried to 
(cid:147)recapture(cid:148) the tax value of the property by increasing its assessed value by 4% in a single year.  The 
assessors in all California counties, including the County, use a similar methodology in raising the taxable 
values of property beyond 2% in a single year.  The SBE has approved such methodology for increasing 
assessed values.  On December 12, 2002, the Orange County Superior Court ruled to restate the complaint 
as a class action, which could have the effect of extending its ruling to other similar cases.  During 2002, 
two similar cases relating to properties in San Diego and Los Angeles Counties were heard and decided 
differently on the issue of the ability of a county assessor to recapture value at greater than 2% per year. 

The Orange County Superior Court ruling was appealed by the Orange County Assessor and oral 
arguments before Division 3 of the California Court of Appeals, Fourth District, in Santa Ana, California, 
were heard on January 7, 2004.  On March 26, 2004, the Court of Appeals overturned the Orange County 
Superior  Court ruling  and determined that  the  methodology  used  by  the  Orange  County  Assessor  was 

57 

 

constitutional.    On  May 5, 2004,  the  respondent  filed  a  petition  to  the  California  Supreme  Court  for 
review of the decision published by the Court of Appeal.  On July 21, 2004, the California Supreme Court 
denied the petition to review the decision by the Court of Appeal.  This action concluded the legal review 
of this case. 

Secondary Market 

There can be no guarantee that there will be a secondary market for the Bonds, or, if a secondary 
market  exists, that  such  Bonds  can  be  sold  for  any  particular  price.    Occasionally,  because  of  general 
market conditions or because of adverse history or economic prospects connected with a particular issue, 
secondary  marketing  practices  in  connection  with  a  particular  issue  are  suspended  or  terminated.  
Additionally,  prices  of issues  for  which  a  market  is  being  made  will  depend upon  the  then  prevailing 
circumstances.  Such prices could be substantially different from the original purchase price. 

Economic, Political, Social, and Environmental Conditions 

Prospective  investors  are  encouraged  to  evaluate  current  and  prospective  economic,  political, 
social, and environmental conditions as part of an informed investment decision.  Changes in economic, 
political, social, or environmental conditions on a local, state, federal, or international level may adversely 
affect  investment  risk  generally.    Such  conditional  changes  may  include  (but  are  not  limited  to)  the 
reduction  or  elimination  of  previously  available  State  of  federal  revenues,  fluctuations  in  business 
production,  consumer  prices,  or  financial  markets,  unemployment  rates,  technological  advancements, 
shortages or surpluses in natural resources or energy supplies, changes in law, social unrest, fluctuations 
in the crime rate, political conflict, acts of war or terrorism, environmental damage and natural disasters. 

THE AGENCY 

The  Agency  was  established  pursuant  to  the  Law  and  was  originally  activated  pursuant  to  by 
Resolution No. 1709, adopted by the City Council on December 18, 1967.  The Agency is charged with 
the authority and responsibility of redeveloping and eliminating blighted areas of the City.  The Agency(cid:146)s 
Component Unit Financial Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, is attached as Appendix D. 

All powers of the Agency are vested in seven members, who are appointed by the Mayor of the 
City  and  confirmed  by  the  City  Council.    The  current  members  of  the  Agency  include  the  following 
individuals: 

 

J. Philip Bentley, Chair 
Danny Ordiz, Member 
Larry Pickett, Member 
Frederick Prince, Member 

Sara Takii, Member 
Larry Koman, Member 
Jim Knapp, Member  

58 

 

The  Agency  exercises  all  the  governmental  functions  as  authorized  under  the  Law  and  has, 
among other powers, the authority to acquire, administer, develop, lease, or sell property, including the 
right of eminent domain and the right to issue bonds and expend the proceeds thereof.  The Agency can 
clear buildings and other improvements and can develop as a building site any real property owned or 
acquired  and  in  connection  with  such  development,  cause  streets,  highways,  and  sidewalks  to  be 
constructed or reconstructed, and cause public utilities to be installed. 

The Agency may, out of funds available for such purposes, pay for all or part of the value of land 
and the cost of building facilities, structures, or other improvements to be publicly owned and operated to 
the extent that such improvements are of benefit to the Project Areas and no other reasonable means of 
financing are available.  The Agency must sell or lease property in the Project Areas for redevelopment in 
strict conformity with the applicable Redevelopment Plan and may specify a period within which such 
redevelopment must begin or be completed. 

THE AUTHORITY 

The  Authority  is  a joint  powers  authority  duly  organized  and  existing  under  the  provisions  of 
Articles 1 through 4 of Chapter 5 of Division 7 of Title 1 (commencing with Section 6500, et seq.) of the 
California  Government  Code  (the  (cid:147)JPA  Act(cid:148)),  and  pursuant  to  that  certain  Joint  Exercise  of  Powers 
Agreement, dated July 7, 1993 (the (cid:147)Joint Powers Agreement(cid:148)), by and between the City and the Agency.  
As provided in the JPA Act, the Authority is a public entity separate and apart from the City and the 
Agency, and the debts and obligations of the Authority do not constitute debts or obligations of the City 
or the Agency.  The Authority is authorized to issue bonds and notes for purposes permitted under the 
JPA Act, including purchasing bonds issued by the Agency or making loans to the Agency to refinance 
indebtedness  incurred  in  connection  with  public  capital  improvements  and  redevelopment  activities 
undertaken by the Agency. 

Upon  the  issuance  of  each  series  of  Bonds,  such  Bonds  will  be  sold  by  the  Agency  to  the 
Authority, and concurrently resold by the Authority to the Underwriter, pursuant to the Marks-Roos Act 
and the terms of the Bond Purchase Agreement.  See (cid:147)THE FINANCING PLAN (cid:150) Negotiated Sale of 
Bonds(cid:148) and (cid:147)UNDERWRITING.(cid:148) 

BANK QUALIFIED BONDS 

The Agency has designated the Series 2009A Bonds and the Series 2009B Bonds as (cid:147)qualified 
tax-exempt  obligations(cid:148)  within  the  meaning  of  Section  265(b)(3)(B)  of  the  Code.    Pursuant  to  that

The Series 2009A Bonds and the Series 2009B Bonds 

TAX MATTERS 

In  the  opinion  of  Orrick,  Herrington  &  Sutcliffe  LLP,  bond  counsel  ((cid:147)Bond  Counsel(cid:148))  to  the 
Agency, as issuer of the Bonds, based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings, and court 
decisions,  and  assuming,  among  other  matters, the accuracy  of  certain  representations  and  compliance 
with certain covenants, interest on the Series 2009A Bonds and the Series 2009B Bonds is excluded from 
gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code and is exempt from State of 
California  personal  income  taxes.    Bond  Counsel  is  of  the  further  opinion  that  such  interest  is  not  a 
specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, 
nor is it included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable 
income.    Complete  copies  of  the  proposed  forms  of  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel  with  respect  to  the 
Series 2009A Bonds and Series 2009B Bonds are set forth in Appendix E hereto. 

Further Information Respecting the Series 2009A Bonds and the Series 2009B Bonds 

To the extent the issue  price  of any  maturity  of the Series  2009A  Bonds  or  the  Series 2009B 
Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds 
(excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of such Series 2009A 
Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds), the difference constitutes (cid:147)original issue discount,(cid:148) the accrual of which, 
to  the  extent  properly  allocable  to  each  Beneficial  Owner  thereof,  is  treated  as  interest  on  the 
Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds, which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax 
purposes and State of California personal income taxes.  For this purpose, the issue price of a particular 
maturity  of  the  Series  2009A  Bonds  or  Series  2009B  Bonds  is  the  first  price  at  which  a  substantial 
amount  of  such  maturity  of  the  Series  2009A  Bonds  or  Series  2009B  Bonds  is  sold  to  the  public 
(excluding  bond  houses,  brokers,  or  similar  persons  or  organizations  acting  in  the  capacity  of 
underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers).  The original issue discount with respect to any maturity 
of  the  Series  2009A  Bonds  or  Series  2009B  Bonds  accrues  daily  over  the  term  to  maturity  of  such 
Series 2009A  Bonds  or  Series  2009B  Bonds  on  the  basis  of  a  constant  interest  rate  compounded 
semiannually (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates).  The accruing original issue 
discount is added to the adjusted basis of such Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds to determine 
taxable gain or loss upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Series 
2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds.  Beneficial Owners of the Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B 
Bonds  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  with  respect  to  the  tax  consequences  of  ownership  of 
Series 2009A  Bonds  or  Series  2009B  Bonds  with  original  issue  discount,  including  the  treatment  of 
Beneficial Owners who do not purchase such Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds in the original 
offering  to  the  public  at  the  first  price  at  which  a  substantial  amount  of  such  Series  2009A  Bonds  or 
Series 2009B Bonds is sold to the public. 

Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, 
for an amount greater than their principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier 
call date) ((cid:147)Premium Series 2009A Bonds(cid:148) or (cid:147)Premium Series 2009B Bonds(cid:148)) will be treated as having 
amortizable bond premium.  No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of 
bonds, like the Premium Series 2009A Bonds or the Premium Series 2009B Bonds, the interest on which 
is  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.    However,  the  amount  of  tax  exempt 
interest  received,  and  a  Beneficial  Owner(cid:146)s  basis  in  a  Premium  Series  2009A  Bond  or  a  Premium 
Series 2009B Bond, will be reduced by the amount of amortizable bond premium properly allocable to 
such Beneficial Owner.  Beneficial Owners of Premium Series 2009A Bonds or Premium Series 2009B 
Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond 
premium in their particular circumstances.  

60 

 

The  Code  imposes  various  restrictions,  conditions,  and  requirements  relating  to  the  exclusion 
from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Series 2009A 
Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds.  The Agency has made certain representations and covenanted to comply 
with certain restrictions, conditions, and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the Series 2009A 
Bonds  or  Series  2009B  Bonds  will  not  be  included  in  federal  gross  income.    Inaccuracy  of  these 
representations  or  failure  to  comply  with  these  covenants  may  result  in  interest  on  the  Series  2009A 
Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly 
from the date of original issuance of the Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds.  The opinion of 
Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants.  Bond 
Counsel  has  not  undertaken  to  determine (or  to  inform  any  person)  whether  any  actions taken  (or not 
taken) or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel(cid:146)s attention 
after the date of issuance of the Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds may adversely affect the 
value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds.  Accordingly, 
the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such 
actions, events or matters. 

Although  Bond  Counsel  is  of  the  opinion  that  interest  on  the  Series  2009A  Bonds  or  Series 
2009B Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of 
California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, 
the Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner(cid:146)s federal, state, 
or local tax liability.  The nature and extent of these other tax consequences depends upon the particular 
tax status of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner(cid:146)s other items of income or deduction.  Bond 
Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences. 

Future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may 
cause interest on the Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to 
federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent 
Beneficial  Owners  of  the  Series  2009A  Bonds  or  Series  2009B  Bonds  from  realizing  the  full  current 
benefit of the tax status of such interest.  The introduction or enactment of any such future legislative 
proposals,  clarification  of  the  Code,  or  court  decisions  may  also  affect  the  market  price  for,  or 
marketability  of,  the  Series  2009A  Bonds  or  Series  2009B  Bonds.    Prospective  purchasers  of  the 
Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending 
or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations, or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses 
no opinion. 

The  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel  is  based  on  current  legal  authority,  covers  certain  matters  not 
directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel(cid:146)s judgment as to the proper treatment 
of the Series 2009A Bonds or Series 2009B Bonds for federal income tax purposes.  It is not binding on 
the Internal Revenue Service ((cid:147)IRS(cid:148)) or the courts.  Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not 
given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of the Agency, or about the effect of future 
changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by 
the IRS.  The Agency has covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code. 

Bond Counsel(cid:146)s engagement with respect to each of the Series 2009A Bonds and Series 2009B 
Bonds ends with the issuance of each series of such Bonds and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel 
is not obligated to defend the Agency or the Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the 
Series 2009A Bonds or the Series 2009B Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS.  Under 
current procedures, parties other than the Agency and their appointed counsel, including the Beneficial 
Owners,  would  have  little,  if  any,  right  to  participate  in  the  audit  examination  process.    Moreover, 
because  achieving  judicial  review  in  connection  with  an  audit  examination  of  tax-exempt  bonds  is 
difficult, obtaining an independent review of IRS positions with which the Agency legitimately disagrees, 
may not be practicable.  Any action of the IRS, including but not limited to selection of the Series 2009A 

61 

 

Bonds or the Series 2009B Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or an audit of bonds 
presenting similar tax issues may affect the market price for, or the marketability of, the Series 2009A 
Bonds  or  the  Series  2009B  Bonds,  and  may  cause  the  Agency  or  the  Beneficial  Owners  to  incur 
significant expense. 

UNDERWRITING 

Each series of Bonds is being purchased by George K. Baum & Company, as Underwriter.  The 
Underwriter has agreed to purchase each series of Bonds at the following prices:  (i) $1,936,489.50 for the 
Series 2009A Bonds (which represents the aggregate principal amount of the Series 2009A Bonds, less an 
Underwriter(cid:146)s  discount  of  $25,080.00,  less  a  net  original  issue  discount  of  $128,430.50);  and 
(ii) $1,177,628.00 for the Series 2009B Bonds (which represents the aggregate principal amount of the 
Series 2009B Bonds, less an Underwriter(cid:146)s discount of $14,880.00, less a net original issue discount of 
$47,492.00).  The contract of purchase pursuant to which each series of Bonds is being purchased by the 
Underwriter  (the  (cid:147)Bond  Purchase  Agreement(cid:148))  provides  that  the  Underwriter  will  purchase  all  of  the 
Bonds of each series if any are purchased. 

The  initial  public  offering  prices  to  be  stated  on  the  cover  of  this  Official  Statement  may  be 
changed from time to time by the Underwriter.  The Underwriter may offer and sell Bonds of each series 
to  certain  dealers,  dealer  banks,  banks  acting  as  agents,  and  others  at  prices  lower  than  said  public 
offering prices.

RATINGS 

 
Moody(cid:146)s Investors Service, Inc. has assigned a municipal bond ratings of (cid:147)Baa2(cid:148) to the Series 
2009A  Bonds  and  (cid:147)Baa1(cid:148)  to  the  Series  2009B  Bonds.    Such  ratings  reflect  only  the  views  of  such 
organization and any desired explanation of the significance of such ratings should be obtained from the 
rating agency furnishing the same.  Generally, a rating agency bases its rating on the information and 
materials furnished to it and on investigations, studies, and assumptions of its own.  There is no assurance 
such ratings will continue for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be revised downward 
or withdrawn entirely by the rating agency, if in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances so 
warrant.  Any such downward revision or withdrawal of the foregoing ratings may have an adverse effect 
on the market price of the applicable series of Bonds.

In the event that, on any of the foregoing transfer dates, the amount on deposit in the Parity Debt Service
Account is insufficient to pay the obligations coming due on the corresponding Principal or Interest Payment Date,
the amounts transferred to the Trustee and paid to CIEDB shall be reduced pro-rata, in keeping with the status of the
Series 2009A Bonds and the CIEDB Loan Agreement as parity debt obligations; and in the event that the amount on
deposit in the Parity Debt Service Account is insufficient to pay both the principal and interest coming due on any
August 1 payment date, the amounts available shall be first allocated to the payment of interest due to the fullest
extent possible and only the balance, if any, shall be allocated to principal. Any amount of principal not paid when
due shall continue to accrue interest at the rate applicable to such Principal Installment until paid.

Establishment and Administration of Costs of Issuance Fund

There is created a special trust fund to be held by the Trustee called the “Bakersfield Redevelopment
Agency, Tax Increment Revenue Bonds Costs of Issuance Fund (OTK-P)” (the “Costs of Issuance Fund”).
Forthwith upon receipt of the proceeds of sale of the Series 2009A Bonds, the Trustee shall deposit the amount of
bond proceeds prescribed by the Indenture in the Costs of Issuance Fund. All moneys in the Costs of Issuance Fund
shall be applied to the payment of Costs of Issuance incurred by the Agency in connection with the authorization,
issuance and sale of Bonds, including the Series 2009A Bonds and any Additional Bonds delivered to the original
purchaser thereof on the Closing Date. The Trustee shall pay moneys from the Costs of Issuance Fund upon receipt
of requisitions drawn thereon and signed by an Authorized Representative of the Agency, and the Trustee may
conclusively rely upon such requisitions. Upon the payment in full of such costs and expenses or the making of
adequate provision for the payment thereof, evidenced by a Written Request of the Agency to the Trustee, any
balance remaining in such Fund shall be transferred to the Agency for deposit in the Series 2009A Bond Proceeds
Account within the Redevelopment Special Fund, and pending such application, the moneys in such Fund may be
invested as permitted in the Indenture.

Application of Moneys Deposited in Series 2009A Bond Proceeds Account Within the Redevelopment Special
Fund

Forthwith upon receipt from the Trustee of the amount of the proceeds of sale of the Series 2009A Bonds

prescribed by the Indenture, the Agency shall deposit said amount in the Series 2009A Bond Proceeds Account.

Moneys in the Series 2009A Bond Proceeds Account shall be used and disbursed in the manner provided
by law for the purpose of aiding in financing or refinancing the Project (or for making reimbursements to the
Agency for such costs theretofore paid by it); provided that all expenditures of moneys in the Series 2009A Bond
Proceeds Account shall be restricted to Permitted Uses of Series 2009A Bond Proceeds so as to preserve the status
of the Series 2009A Bonds as Tax-Exempt Bonds.

The Agency warrants that each withdrawal from the foregoing account within the Redevelopment Special
Fund shall be made in the manner provided by law and the Indenture for the purpose of aiding in financing or
refinancing the Project or for making reimbursements to the Agency for such costs theretofore paid by the Agency.

Establishment and Administration of Debt Service and Reserve Fund and Accounts Within Such Fund

There is created a special trust fund to be held by the Trustee called the “Bakersfield Redevelopment
Agency, Debt Service and Reserve Fund (OTK-P)” (the “Debt Service and Reserve Fund”). Within the Debt Service
and Reserve Fund, the Trustee shall establish (a) an Interest Account, (b) a Principal Account, (c) a Term Bonds
Sinking Account and (d) a Reserve Account.

A-14

All Tax Increment Revenues transferred to the Trustee by the Agency in accordance with the Indenture
shall be set aside by the Trustee in each Fiscal Year when and as received in the applicable account within the Debt
Service and Reserve Fund. All moneys in each of such accounts shall be held in trust by the Trustee and shall be
applied, used and withdrawn only for the purposes hereinafter authorized in the Indenture.

(1)

Interest Account. Amounts transferred to the Trustee by the Agency pursuant to the Indenture
shall be deposited in the Interest Account; provided that no deposit need be made into the Interest Account if the
amount contained therein is at least equal to the aggregate amount of the interest becoming due and payable on all
Outstanding Bonds on the Interest Payment Dates in such Fiscal Year. All moneys in the Interest Account shall be
used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of paying the interest on the Bonds as it shall become due
and payable (including accrued interest on any Bonds purchased or redeemed prior to maturity).

(2)

Principal Account. Amounts transferred to the Trustee by the Agency pursuant to the Indenture
shall be deposited in the Principal Account; provided that no deposit need be made into the Principal Account if the
amount contained therein is at least equal to the aggregate amount of principal of all Outstanding Serial Bonds
becoming due and payable on the Principal Payment Date in such Fiscal Year. All money in the Principal Account
shall be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of paying principal of the Serial Bonds as they
shall become due and payable.

(3)

Term Bonds Sinking Account. Amounts transferred to the Trustee by the Agency pursuant to the
Indenture shall be deposited in the Term Bonds Sinking Account; provided no deposit need be made in the Term
Bonds Sinking Account if the amount contained therein is at least equal to the aggregate amount of all Sinking
Account Installments required to be made on the Sinking Account Payment Date in such Fiscal Year. All moneys in
the Term Bonds Sinking Account shall be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of purchasing or
redeeming the Term Bonds in accordance with the Indenture.

(4)

Reserve Account. Forthwith upon receipt of the proceeds of sale of the Series 2009A Bonds, the
Trustee shall deposit in the Reserve Account the amount prescribed by the Indenture. Thereafter, amounts, if any,
transferred to the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture shall be deposited in the Reserve Account; provided that no
deposit need be made into the Reserve Account so long as there shall be on deposit therein an amount equal to the
Reserve Account Requirement. All money in or credited to the Reserve Account shall be used and withdrawn by
the Trustee solely for the purpose of replenishing the Interest Account, the Principal Account or the Term Bonds
Sinking Account in such order, in the event of any deficiency in any of such accounts occurring on any Interest
Payment Date, Principal Payment Date or Sinking Account Payment Date, or for the purpose of paying the interest
on or the principal of the Bonds in the event that no other money of the Agency is lawfully available therefor, or for
the retirement of all Bonds then Outstanding; provided that, so long as the Agency is not in default under the
Indenture any amount in the Reserve Account in excess of the Reserve Account Requirement shall be withdrawn
from the Reserve Account by the Trustee and transferred to the Agency for deposit in the General Operating
Account (OTK-P) within the Redevelopment Special Fund; and provided further that, in the event that a Reserve
Account Credit Instrument is provided by the Agency to the Trustee for deposit in the Reserve Account, any amount
then on deposit in the Reserve Account in excess of the Reserve Account Requirement as a result of such deposit of
a Reserve Account Credit Instrument may, upon the Written Request of the Agency to the Trustee, be withdrawn
from the Reserve Account by the Trustee and transferred to the Agency for deposit in the General Operating
Account (OTK-P) within the Redevelopment Special Fund.

All or any portion of the Reserve Account Requirement with respect to any series of Additional Bonds may
be satisfied by the provision of a policy of insurance, a surety bond, a letter of credit or other comparable credit
facility which meets the requirements of this section (each, a “Reserve Account Credit Instrument”), or a
combination thereof, which, together with moneys on deposit in the Reserve Account, provide funds in an aggregate
amount equal to the Reserve Account Requirement. Notwithstanding any provision of the Indenture to the contrary,
the Reserve Account Requirement for the Series 2009A Bonds may not be satisfied by the provision of a Reserve
Account Credit Instrument, nor shall moneys on deposit in the Reserve Account in satisfaction of that portion of the
Reserve Account Requirement relating to the Series 2009A Bonds be withdrawn from the Reserve Account for the
purpose of replenishing any deficiency in the Interest Account, the Principal Account or the Term Bonds Sinking
Account relating to payments of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on a series of Additional Bonds, the
Reserve Account Requirement for which has been satisfied through the provision of a Reserve Account Credit

A-15

Instrument.

Any Reserve Account Credit Instrument secured for the Bonds shall meet the following requirements:

(a)

A surety bond or insurance policy issued to the Trustee, by a company licensed to issue an
insurance policy guaranteeing the timely payment of debt service on the Bonds (a “Municipal Insurer”) may be
deposited in the Reserve Account to meet the Reserve Account Requirement if the claims paying ability of the issuer
thereof shall be rated, at the time of such issuance, “AAA” or “Aaa” by S&P or Moody’s, respectively.

(b)

A surety bond or insurance policy issued to the Trustee by an entity other than a Municipal Insurer
may be deposited in the Reserve Account to meet the Reserve Account Requirement if the claims paying ability of
the issuer thereof shall be rated, at the time of such issuance, “AAA” or “Aaa” by S&P or Moody’s, respectively.

(c)

An unconditional irrevocable letter of credit issued to the Trustee by a bank may be deposited in
the Reserve Account to meet the Reserve Account Requirement if the issuer thereof is rated, at the time of such
issuance, at least “AA” by S&P. The letter of credit shall be payable in one or more draws upon presentation by the
beneficiary of a sight draft accompanied by its certificate that it then holds insufficient funds to make a required
payment of principal or interest on the bonds. The draws shall be payable within two days of presentation of the
sight draft. The letter of credit shall be for a term of not less than three years. The issuer of the letter of credit shall
be required to notify the Agency and the Trustee, not later than 30 months prior to the state expiration date of the
letter of credit, as to whether such expiration date shall be extended, and if so, shall indicate the new expiration date.

If such notice indicates that the expiration date shall not be extended, the Agency shall deposit in the
Reserve Account an amount sufficient to cause the cash or permitted investments on deposit in the Reserve Account
together with any other qualifying credit instruments, to equal the Reserve Account Requirement on all outstanding
Bonds, such deposit to be paid in equal installments on at least a semi-annual basis over the remaining term of the
letter of credit, unless the Reserve Account Credit Instrument is replaced by a Reserve Account Credit Instrument
meeting the requirements in any of the foregoing subsections (a)-(c). The letter of credit shall permit a draw in full
not less than two weeks prior to the expiration or termination of such letter of credit if the letter of credit has not
been replaced or renewed. The Trustee shall draw upon the letter of credit prior to its expiration or termination
unless an acceptable replacement is in place or the Reserve Account is fully funded in its required amount.

(d)

The use of any Reserve Account Credit Instrument pursuant to the Indenture shall be subject to
receipt of an opinion of counsel as to the due authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of such
instrument in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and, in the
event the issuer of such credit instrument is not a domestic entity, an opinion of foreign counsel. In addition, the use
of an irrevocable letter of credit shall be subject to receipt of an opinion of counsel to the effect that payments under
such letter of credit would not constitute avoidable preferences under Section 547 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
similar state laws with avoidable preference provisions in the event of the filing of a petition for relief under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or similar state laws by or against the issuer of the bonds (or any other account party under the
letter of credit).

(e)

The obligation to reimburse the issuer of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument for any fees,
expenses, claims or draws upon such Reserve Account Credit Instrument shall be subordinate to the payment of debt
service on the Bonds. The right of the issuer of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument to payment or reimbursement
of its fees and expenses shall be subordinated to cash replenishment of the Reserve Account, and, subject to the
second succeeding sentence, its right to reimbursement for claims or draws shall be on a parity with the case
replenishment of the Reserve Account. The Reserve Account Credit Instrument shall provide for a revolving feature
under which the amount available thereunder will be reinstated to the extent of any reimbursement of draws or
claims paid. If the revolving feature is suspended or terminated for any reason, the right of the issuer of the Reserve
Account Credit Instrument to reimbursement will be further subordinated to cash replenishment of the Reserve
Account to an amount equal to the difference between the full original amount available under the Reserve Account
Credit Instrument and the amount then available for further draws or claims. If (i) the issuer of a Reserve Account
Credit Instrument becomes insolvent or (ii) the issuer of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument defaults in its
payment obligations thereunder, the obligation to reimburse the issuer of the Reserve Account Credit Instrument
shall be subordinate to the cash replenishment of the Reserve Account.

A-16

(f)

If the revolving reinstatement feature described in the preceding paragraph is suspended or
terminated, the Agency shall either (a) deposit into the Reserve Account an amount sufficient to cause the cash or
Permitted Investments on deposit in the Reserve Account to equal the Reserve Account Requirement on all
outstanding Bonds, such amount to be paid over the ensuing five years in equal installments deposited at least semi-
annually or (b) replace such instrument with a surety bond, insurance policy or letter of credit meeting the
requirements in any of subsections (a)-(c) above within six months of such occurrence. In the event that the issuer
of the Reserve Account Credit Instrument defaults in its payment obligations or the issuer of the Reserve Account
Credit Instrument becomes insolvent, the Agency shall either (1) deposit into the Reserve Account an amount
sufficient to cause the cash or Permitted Investments on deposit in the Reserve Account to equal the Reserve
Account Requirement on all outstanding Bonds, such amount to be paid over the ensuing year in equal installments
on at least a monthly basis or (2) replace such instrument with a surety bond, insurance policy or letter of credit
meeting the requirements in any of subsections (a)-(c) above within six months of such occurrence.

(g)

Where applicable, the amount available for draws or claims under the Reserve Account Credit
Instrument may be reduced by the amount of cash or Permitted Investments deposited in the Reserve Account
pursuant to clause (a) of the preceding subparagraph (f).

(h)

The Trustee shall ascertain the necessity for a claim or draw upon the Reserve Account Credit
Instrument and to provide notice to the issuer of the Reserve Account Credit Instrument in accordance with its terms
not later than three days (or such longer period as may be necessary depending on the permitted time period for
honoring a draw under the Reserve Account Credit Instrument) prior to each interest payment date. Cash on deposit
in the Reserve Account shall be used (or investments purchased with such cash shall be liquidated and the proceeds
applied as required) prior to any drawing on any Reserve Account Credit Instrument. If and to the extent that more
than one Reserve Account Credit Instrument is deposited in the Reserve Account, drawings thereunder and
repayments of costs associated therewith shall be made on a pro rata basis, calculated by reference to the maximum
amounts available thereunder.

(5)

General Operating Account (OTK-P). After making the deposits referred to in paragraphs (1)
through (4) above in such Fiscal Year, the Trustee shall transfer to the Agency for deposit in the General Operating
Account (OTK-P) within the Redevelopment Special Fund all money then remaining in the Debt Service and
Reserve Fund, and the Agency may apply moneys in the General Operating Account (OTK-P) to any lawful purpose
of the Agency with respect to the Project.

Investment of Moneys in Funds and Accounts

Moneys in the Costs of Issuance Fund and in the Interest Account, the Principal Account, the Term Bonds
Sinking Account and the Reserve Account within the Debt Service and Reserve Fund, upon the Written Request of
the Agency, shall be invested by the Trustee in Permitted Investments.
If such instructions are not provided, the
Trustee shall invest such funds described in Clause (e) of the definition of Permitted Investments. The obligations in
which moneys in the Interest Account, the Principal Account or the Term Bond Sinking Account are invested shall
mature prior to the date on which such moneys are estimated to be required to be paid out under the Indenture.

The obligations in which moneys in the Senior Debt Service Account or the Parity Debt Service Account
within the Redevelopment Special Fund are invested shall mature prior to the date on which such moneys are
estimated to be required to be paid out under the Indenture. Moneys in the General Operating Account (OTK-P) or
the Series 2009A Bond Proceeds Account within the Redevelopment Special Fund may be invested by the Agency
in any investments permitted by law.

Any interest, income or profits from the deposits or investments of moneys in any of the accounts within
the Redevelopment Special Fund shall be deposited in the General Operating Account (OTK-P) within the
Redevelopment Special Fund. Any interest, income or profits from the deposits or investments of moneys in the
Costs of Issuance Fund shall be retained in said fund to be disbursed in accordance with the Indenture. Any interest,
income or profits from the deposits or investments of moneys in any of the all other funds and accounts held by the
Trustee shall be deposited in the Reserve Account within the Debt Service and Reserve Fund to the extent necessary
to restore the balance on deposit in the Reserve Account to an amount equal to the Reserve Account Requirement,

A-17

and otherwise shall be transferred not later than August 15 annually to the Agency for deposit in the General
Operating Account (OTK-P) within the Redevelopment Special Fund.

For purposes of determining the amount on deposit in any fund or account held by the Trustee under the
Indenture, all Permitted Investments credited to such fund or account shall be valued at the lower of cost or the
market price thereof (excluding accrued interest and brokerage commissions, if any); provided that Permitted
Investments credited to the Reserve Account shall be valued at market value (exclusive of accrued interest and
brokerage commissions, if any), and any deficiency in the Reserve Account resulting from a decline in market value
shall be restored to the Reserve Account Requirement no later than the next valuation date. Amounts and
investments in the funds and accounts held by the Trustee under the Indenture shall be valued at least annually not
later than the tenth day of August.

The Agency acknowledges that to the extent regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency or other
applicable regulatory entity grant the Agency the right to receive brokerage confirmations of security transactions as
they occur, the Agency specifically waives receipt of
If
requested in writing by the Agency, the Trustee will furnish the Agency periodic cash transaction statements which
include detail for all investment transactions made by the Trustee under the Indenture. The Trustee may make any
investments under the Indenture through its own bond or investment department or trust investment department, or
those of its parent or any affiliate. The Trustee or any of its affiliates may act as sponsor, advisor or manager in
connection with any investments made by the Trustee under the Indenture. The Trustee shall not be responsible for
any loss from any sale or liquidation of investments made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

such confirmations to the extent permitted by law.

Covenants of the Agency

Punctual Payment. The Agency will punctually pay the interest on and principal of and redemption
premiums, if any, to become due with respect to the Bonds, in strict conformity with the terms of the Bonds and of
the Indenture and will faithfully satisfy, observe and perform all conditions, covenants and requirements of the
Bonds and of the Indenture.

Against Encumbrances. The Agency will not mortgage or otherwise encumber, pledge or place any charge
upon any of the Tax Increment Revenues, except as provided in the Indenture, and will not issue any obligation or
security superior to or on a parity with the Bonds payable in whole or in part from the Tax Increment Revenues
(other than Additional Bonds).

Extension or Funding of Claims for Interest. In order to prevent any claims for interest after maturity, the
Agency will not, directly or indirectly, extend or consent to the extension of the time for the payment of any claim
for interest on any Bonds and will not, directly or indirectly, be a party to or approve any such arrangements by
purchasing or funding said claims for interest or in any other manner. In case any such claim for interest shall be
extended or funded, whether or not with the consent of the Agency, such claim for interest so extended or funded
shall not be entitled, in case of default under the Indenture, to the benefits of the Indenture, except subject to the
prior payment in full of the principal of all of the Bonds then Outstanding and of all claims for interest which shall
not have been so extended or funded.

Management and Operation of Properties. The Agency will manage and operate all properties owned by
the Agency and comprising any part of the Project in a sound and business-like manner and in conformity with all
valid requirements of any governmental authority relative to the Project or any part thereof, and will keep such
properties insured at all times in conformity with sound business practice.

Payment of Claims. The Agency will pay and discharge any and all lawful claims for labor, materials or
supplies which, if unpaid, might become a lien or charge upon the properties owned by the Agency or upon the Tax
Increment Revenues or any part thereof, or upon any funds in the hands of the Trustee, or which might impair the
security of the Bonds; provided that nothing contained in the Indenture shall require the Agency to make any such
payments so long as the Agency in good faith shall contest the validity of any such claims.

A-18

Books and Accounts; Annual Audited Financial Statements. The Agency will keep proper books of record
and accounts (and, as to the Debt Service and Reserve Fund, shall cause the Trustee to keep proper books of record
and accounts), separate from all other records and accounts of the Agency or the Trustee, as the case may be, in
which complete and correct entries shall be made of all transactions relating to the Project and the Redevelopment
Special Fund. Such books of record and accounts shall at all times during business hours be subject to the
inspection of the Trustee (who shall have no duty or obligation to inspect) or of the Owners of not less than ten per
cent (10%) of the aggregate amount of Bond Obligation or their representatives authorized in writing.

The Agency will prepare and file with the Trustee annually as soon as practicable, but in any event not later
than two hundred seventy (270) days after the close of each Fiscal Year, so long as any Bonds are Outstanding, an
audited financial statement of the Agency for the preceding Fiscal Year prepared by an Independent Certified Public
Accountant, which audited financial statement shall include a statement as to the manner and extent to which the
Agency has complied with the provisions of the Indenture as it relates to the funds and accounts established pursuant
to the Indenture.

Protection of Security and Rights of Owners. The Agency will preserve and protect the security of the
Bonds and the rights of the Owners, and will warrant and defend their rights against all claims and demands of all
persons. From and after the sale and delivery of any Bonds by the Agency, such Bonds shall be incontestable by the
Agency.

Payment of Taxes and Other Charges. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Agency will pay and
discharge all taxes, service charges, assessments and other governmental charges which may hereafter be lawfully
imposed upon the Agency or any properties owned by the Agency in the Project Areas, or upon the revenues
therefrom, when the same shall become due; provided that nothing contained in the Indenture shall require the
Agency to make any such payments so long as the Agency in good faith shall contest the validity of any such taxes,
service charges, assessments or other governmental charges.

Financing the Project. The Agency will commence the financing or refinancing of the costs of the Project
to be aided with the proceeds of the Bonds with all practicable dispatch, and such financing will be accomplished
and completed in a sound, economical and expeditious manner and in conformity with the Redevelopment Plan and
the Law so as to complete said financing or refinancing as soon as possible.

Taxation of Leased Property. Whenever any property in the Project is redeveloped by the Agency and
thereafter is leased by the Agency to any person or persons, or whenever the Agency leases any real property in the
Project to any person or persons for redevelopment, the property shall be assessed and taxed in the same manner as
privately-owned property (in accordance with the Law), and the lease or contract shall provide (1) that the lessee
shall pay taxes upon the assessed value of the entire property and not merely upon the assessed value of the
leasehold interest, and (2) that if for any reason the taxes paid by the lessee on such property in any year during the
term of the lease shall be less than the taxes that would have been payable upon the entire property if the property
were assessed and taxed in the same manner as privately-owned property, the lessee shall pay such difference to the
Agency within thirty (30) days after the taxes for such year become payable, and in any event prior to the
delinquency date of such taxes established by law.

Disposition of Property in Project Areas. The Agency will not, except as otherwise provided in the
Indenture, authorize the disposition of any real property in the Project Areas to anyone which will result in such
property becoming exempt from taxation because of public ownership or use or otherwise (except for public
ownership or use contemplated by the applicable Redevelopment Plan in effect on the date of adoption of the
Indenture, or property to be used for public streets or public off-street parking facilities or easements or rights of
way for public utilities, or other similar uses) if such dispositions, together with all similar prior dispositions on or
subsequent to the effective date of the Indenture, shall comprise more than ten per cent (10%) of the assessed
valuation (as shown on the most recent equalization assessment roll of the County) in the Project Areas.
If the
Agency proposes to make any such disposition which, together with all similar dispositions on or subsequent to the
effective date of the Indenture, shall comprise more than ten per cent (10%) of the assessed valuation (as shown on
the most recent equalization assessment roll of the County) in the Project Areas, it shall cause to be filed with the
Trustee a Consultant’s Report on the effect of such proposed disposition. If the Consultant’s Report concludes that
Bondholder’s security will not be materially impaired by such proposed disposition, the Agency may proceed with

A-19

such proposed disposition. If the Consultant’s Report concludes that Tax Increments will be materially reduced by
such proposed disposition, the Agency shall as a condition precedent to proceeding with such proposed disposition,
require that such new owner or owners either:

(1)

Pay to the Trustee, so long as any of the Bonds are Outstanding, an amount equal to the amount
that would have been received by the Agency as Tax Increment Revenues if such property were assessed and taxed
in the same manner as privately-owned non-exempt property, which payment shall be made within thirty (30) days
after taxes for each year would become payable to the taxing agencies for non-exempt property and in any event
prior to the delinquency date of such taxes established by law; or

(2)

Pay to the Trustee a single sum equal to the amount estimated by an Independent Redevelopment
Consultant to be receivable from taxes on such property from the date of such payment to the last maturity date of
all Outstanding Bonds, less a reasonable discount value.

All such payments to the Trustee in lieu of taxes shall be treated as Tax Increment Revenues and shall be

deposited by the Trustee in the Redevelopment Special Fund.

Amendment of the Redevelopment Plan. The Agency will not amend the Redevelopment Plan for the
Project (other than an amendment to extend the effectiveness of the Redevelopment Plan or the time limit for the
receipt of Tax Increment Revenues by the Agency) except as provided in this section.
If the Agency proposes to
amend the Redevelopment Plan (other than an amendment to extend the effectiveness of the Redevelopment Plan or
the time limit for the receipt of Tax Increment Revenues by the Agency), it shall cause to be filed with the Trustee a
Consultant’s Report on the effect of such proposed amendment.
If the Consultant’s Report concludes that Tax
Increment Revenues will not be materially reduced by such proposed amendment, the Agency may undertake such
amendment.
If the Consultant’s Report concludes that Tax Increment Revenues may be or will be materially
reduced by such proposed amendment, the Agency may not undertake such proposed amendment.

Tax Increment Revenues. The Agency shall comply with all requirements of the Law to insure the
allocation and payment to it of the Tax Increment Revenues, including without limitation the timely filing of any
necessary statements of indebtedness with appropriate officials of Kern County.

The Agency expressly finds and determines that the pledge, payment and setting aside of Tax Increment
Revenues as provided for in the Indenture is not subject to any limitation contained in Article XIIIB of the
Constitution of the State of California.

Further Assurances. The Agency will adopt, make, execute and deliver any and all such further
resolutions, instruments and assurances as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out the intention or to
facilitate the performance of the Indenture, and for the better assuring and confirming unto the Owners of the Bonds
of the rights and benefits provided in the Indenture.

Designation of the Series 2009A Bonds as Qualified Tax-Exempt Obligations and Exceptions from Rebate
Requirement. The Governing Board of the Agency finds that it reasonably expects that the amount of tax-exempt
obligations which are being and will be issued by the Agency, or by any other entity on behalf of the Agency, in
calendar year 2009 will not exceed $5,000,000, and designates the Series 2009A Bonds as qualified tax-exempt
obligations for purposes of Section 265(b)(3)(B) of the Code, and the Chair of the Governing Board and the
Executive Director, or either of them, are authorized to execute and deliver any appropriate certification to this
effect on behalf of the Agency. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Agency expects to be relieved of the
obligation to pay the Rebate Requirement based upon the small issuer exception of Section 148(f)(4)(D) of the
Code.

Tax Covenants; Rebate Fund. The Agency covenants that it will not take any action, or fail to take any
action, if any such action or failure to take action would adversely affect the exclusion from gross income of the
interest on any of the Series 2009A Bonds under Section 103 of the Code. The Agency will not directly or
indirectly use or permit the use of any proceeds of the Series 2009A Bonds or any other funds of the Agency, or take
or omit to take any action, that would cause any of the Series 2009A Bonds to be “private activity bonds” or “private

A-20

loan bonds” within the meaning of Section 141 of the Code, or “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Section
148(a) of the Code, or to be “federally guaranteed” within the meaning of Section 149(b) of the Code. To that end,
the Agency will comply with all requirements of Section 148 of the Code to the extent applicable to any of the
Series 2009A Bonds.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agency agrees that there shall be paid from time to
time all amounts required to be rebated to the United States pursuant to Section 148(f) of the Code and any
temporary, proposed or final Regulations as may be applicable to any series of Bonds from time to time.
In the
event that at any time the Agency is of the opinion that for purposes of this section it is necessary to restrict or limit
the yield on the investment of any moneys held by the Trustee under the Indenture, the Agency shall so instruct the
Trustee in writing, and the Trustee shall take such action as may be necessary in accordance with such instructions.

Pursuant to the foregoing and as recited in the Tax Certificate, the Agency expects that the Series 2009A
In the event for any reason that the
Bonds are and will remain exempt from any Rebate Requirement obligation.
Agency is later advised by Bond Counsel that it may be obligated to pay the Rebate Requirement, the Agency shall
instruct the Trustee in writing to establish and the Trustee shall thereupon establish and maintain a fund separate
from any other
the Indenture designated as the “Rebate Fund.”
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture to the contrary, all amounts deposited into or on deposit in the
Rebate Fund shall be governed by this section and by the Tax Certificate (which is incorporated in the Indenture by
reference). The Agency shall cause to be deposited in the Rebate Fund the Rebate Requirement as provided in the
Tax Certificate. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, all money at any time deposited in the Rebate Fund shall
be held by the Trustee in trust for payment to the federal government of the United States of America. The Agency
and the Owners shall have no rights in or claim to such money.

fund established and maintained under

Upon the written direction of the Agency, the Trustee shall invest all amounts held in the Rebate Fund in

Permitted Investments, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Tax Certificate.

Upon receipt of the Rebate Instructions required to be delivered to the Trustee by the Tax Certificate, the
Trustee shall remit part or all of the balances held in the Rebate Fund to the federal government of the United States
of America, as so directed. In addition, if the Rebate Instructions so direct, the Trustee shall deposit moneys into or
transfer moneys out of the Rebate Fund from or into such accounts or funds as the Rebate Instructions direct. Any
funds remaining in the Rebate Fund after redemption and payment of such series of Bonds and payment of any
required rebate amount, or provision made therefore satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be withdrawn and remitted to
the Agency.

The Trustee shall have no obligation to pay any amounts required to be remitted pursuant to the Indenture,
other than from moneys held in the funds and accounts created under the Indenture or from other moneys provided
to it by the Agency.

The Trustee shall conclusively be deemed to have complied with the provisions of the Indenture if it
follows the directions of the Agency set forth in the Rebate Instructions, and shall not be required to take any actions
thereunder in the absence of Rebate Instructions from the Agency.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the obligation of the Agency to remit or cause to be
remitted any required rebate amount to the United States government and to comply with all other requirements of
the Indenture and the Tax Certificate shall survive the defeasance or payment in full of such series of Bonds.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Indenture to the contrary, if the Agency shall provide to the Trustee
an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that any action required under the Indenture is no longer required, or that
some further or different action is required, to maintain the exclusion from federal gross income of the interest on
the Series 2009A Bonds pursuant to the Code, the Trustee and the Agency may conclusively rely on such opinion in
complying with the provisions in the Indenture, and the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be modified to that
extent.

A-21

Nothing contained in the Indenture shall be construed as prohibiting the issuance of any series of Bonds the
interest on which is not excludable from gross income under Section 103 of the Code, provided, that such series of
Bonds may be issued and the proceeds thereof used without violating any of the covenants in the Indenture as they
may apply to any other series of Bonds.

The Trustee

Appointment and Acceptance of Duties. The Trustee accepts and agrees to the trusts created by the
Indenture to all of which the Agency agrees and the respective Owners of the Bonds, by their purchase and
acceptance thereof, agree.

Duties, Immunities and Liability of Trustee.

(a)

The Trustee shall, prior to an Event of Default, and after the curing or waiver of all Events of
Default which may have occurred, perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in the
Indenture, and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into the Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee
shall, during the existence of any Event of Default (which has not been cured or waived), exercise such of the rights
and powers vested in it by the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a reasonable
individual would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

(b)

The Agency may, in the absence of an Event of Default, and upon receipt of an instrument or
concurrent instruments in writing signed by the Owners of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Bonds then Outstanding (or their attorneys duly authorized in writing) or if at any time the Trustee shall cease to
be eligible in accordance with subsection (e) below, or shall become incapable of acting, or shall commence a case
under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or
any public officer shall take control or charge of the Trustee or its property or affairs for the purpose of
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, shall, remove the Trustee by giving written notice of such removal to the
Trustee, and thereupon the Agency shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee by an instrument in writing.

(c)

The Trustee may, subject to (d) below, resign by giving written notice of such resignation to the
Agency and by giving notice of such resignation by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Owners at the addresses
listed in the Bond Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Agency shall promptly appoint a
successor Trustee by an instrument in writing.

(d)

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become
effective only upon acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.
If no successor Trustee shall have been
appointed and shall have accepted appointment within thirty (30) days of giving notice of removal or notice of
resignation as aforesaid, the resigning Trustee or any Owner (on behalf of himself and all other Owners) may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee, and such court may
thereupon, after such notice (if any) as it may deem proper, appoint such successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee
appointed under the Indenture shall signify its acceptance of such appointment by executing and delivering to the
Agency and to its predecessor Trustee a written acceptance thereof, and thereupon such successor Trustee, without
any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the moneys, estates, properties, rights, powers,
trusts, duties and obligations of such predecessor Trustee, with like effect as if originally named Trustee in the
Indenture; but, nevertheless, at the written request of the Agency or of the successor Trustee, such predecessor
Trustee shall execute and deliver any and all instruments of conveyance or further assurance and do such other
things as may reasonably be required for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor
Trustee all the right, title and interest of such predecessor Trustee in and to any property held by it under the
Indenture and shall pay over, transfer, assign and deliver to the successor Trustee any money or other property
subject to the trusts and conditions set forth in the Indenture. Upon request of the successor Trustee, the Agency
shall execute and deliver any and all instruments as may be reasonably required for more fully and certainly vesting
in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such moneys, estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and
obligations. Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee as provided in the Indenture, such successor
Trustee shall mail a notice of the succession of such Trustee to the trusts under the Indenture by first class mail,
postage prepaid, to the Owners at their addresses listed in the Bond Register.

A-22

(e)

Any Trustee appointed under the provisions of the Indenture shall be a trust company or bank
having the powers of a trust company, having a corporate trust office in California, having (or in the case of a bank
or trust company which is a member of a bank holding company system, the related bank holding company shall
have) a combined capital and surplus of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), and subject to supervision or
examination by federal or state authority. If such bank, trust company or bank holding company publishes a report
of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of any supervising or examining authority
above referred to, then for the purpose of this subsection the combined capital and surplus of such bank or trust
company shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so
published.
In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
subsection, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in the Indenture.

(f)

No provision in the Indenture shall require the Trustee to risk or expend its own funds or

otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties under the Indenture.

(g)

In accepting the trust created by the Indenture, the Trustee acts solely as Trustee for the Owners
and not in its individual capacity, and under no circumstances shall the Trustee be liable in its individual capacity for
the obligations evidenced by the Bonds.

(h)

The Trustee makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the compliance with
legal requirements of the use contemplated by the Agency of the funds under the Indenture. The Trustee is not
responsible for any of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Agency under the Indenture.

(i)

The Trustee shall not be responsible for the recording or filing of any document relating to the
Indenture or of financing statements (or continuation statements in connection therewith). The Trustee shall not be
deemed to have made representations as to the security afforded thereby or as to the validity, sufficiency or priority
of any such document, collateral or security of the Bonds.

(j)

The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Event of Default under the Indenture
unless and until a Responsible Officer shall have actual knowledge thereof at the Trustee’s principal corporate trust
office.

(k)

any funds which the Trustee has released under the Indenture.

(l)

The Trustee shall provide a monthly accounting of all Funds held pursuant to the Indenture to the
Agency within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of such month and shall provide statements of account for
each annual period beginning August 2 and ending August 1, within 90 days after the end of such period. Such
accounting shall show in reasonable detail all financial transactions made by the Trustee during the accounting
period and the balance in any Funds and accounts created by the Trustee under the Indenture as of the beginning and
close of such accounting period.

(m)

All moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied or invested as provided in the

A-23

Merger or Consolidation. Any company into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated or any company resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which it shall be a
party or any company to which the Trustee may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate trust business,
provided such company shall be eligible under the Indenture, shall succeed to the rights and obligations of such
Trustee without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act, anything in the Indenture to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Preservation and Inspection of Documents. All documents received by the Trustee under the provisions of
the Indenture shall be retained in its possession and shall be subject at all reasonable times upon prior notice to the
inspection of the Agency, the Owners of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds and shall be subject at all reasonable times upon prior notice to the inspection of the Agency, the Owners of
at
twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds, and their agents and
representatives duly authorized in writing, at reasonable hours and under reasonable conditions.

least

Execution of Instruments; Proof of Ownership. Any request, direction, consent or other instrument in
writing required or permitted by the Indenture to be signed or executed by Owners may be in any number of
concurrent instruments of similar tenor by different parties and may be signed or executed by such Owners in Person
or by agent appointed by an instrument in writing. Proof of the execution of any such instrument and of the
ownership of Bonds shall be sufficient for any purpose of the Indenture and shall be conclusive in favor of the
Trustee with regard to any action taken, suffered or omitted by either of them under such instrument if made in the
following manner:

(a)

The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument may be proved by the
certificate of any officer in any jurisdiction who, by the laws thereof, has power to take acknowledgments within
such jurisdiction, to the effect that the Person signing such instrument acknowledged before him the execution
thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution.

(b)

The fact of the ownership of Bonds under the Indenture by any Owner and the serial numbers of

such Bonds and the date of his ownership of the same shall be proved by the Bond Register.

Nothing contained in the Indenture shall be construed as limiting the Trustee to such proof, it being
intended that the Trustee may accept any other evidence of the matters stated in the Indenture which to it may seem
sufficient. Any request or consent of the Owner of any Bond shall bind every future Owner of the same Bond and
any Bond or Bonds issued in exchange or substitution therefor or upon the registration of transfer thereof in respect
of anything done by the Trustee in pursuance of such request or consent.

Amendment of the Indenture

Amendment by Consent of Owners. The Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Agency and of the
Owners may be amended at any time by a Supplemental Indenture which shall become binding when the written
consents of the Owners of sixty per cent (60%) in aggregate amount of Bond Obligation, exclusive of Bonds
disqualified as provided in the Indenture are filed with the Trustee. No such amendment shall (1) extend the
maturity of or reduce the interest rate on, or otherwise alter or impair the obligation of the Agency to pay the interest
or principal or redemption premium, if any, at the time and place and at the rate and in the currency provided in the
Indenture of any Bond, without the express written consent of the Owner of such Bond, or (2) permit the creation by
the Agency of any mortgage, pledge or lien upon the Net Tax Increment Revenues superior to or on a parity with the
pledge and lien created in the Indenture for the benefit of the Bonds, without the express written consent of the
Owner of such Bond, or (3) reduce the percentage of Bonds required for the written consent to any such amendment,
without the express written consent of the Owner of such Bond, or (4) modify the rights or obligations of the Trustee
without its prior written assent thereto.

The Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Agency and of the Owners may also be amended at any
time by a Supplemental Indenture which shall become binding upon adoption, without the consent of any Owners,
but only to the extent permitted by law and only for any one or more of the following purposes:

A-24

(a)

To add to the covenants and agreements of the Agency in the Indenture contained, other covenants
and agreements thereafter to be observed, or to surrender any right or power in the Indenture reserved to or
conferred upon the Agency;

(b)

To make such provisions for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, or of curing, correcting or
supplementing any defective provision contained in the Indenture, or in regard to questions arising under the
Indenture, as the Agency may deem necessary or desirable and not inconsistent with the Indenture, and which shall
not materially adversely affect the interests of the Owners of the Bonds;

(c)

To provide for the issuance of any Additional Bonds, and to provide the terms and conditions
under which such Additional Bonds may be issued, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture;

(d)

To modify, amend or supplement the Indenture in such manner as to permit the qualification of the
Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or any similar federal statute hereafter in effect, and to
add such other terms, conditions and provisions as may be permitted by said act or similar federal statute, and which
shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the Owners of the Bonds;

(e)

To maintain the exclusion of interest on Tax-Exempt Bonds from gross income for Federal

income tax purposes; or

(f)

To obtain a bond insurance policy or a rating on the Bonds, or in connection with obtaining a
policy of insurance, surety bond, letter of credit or other comparable credit facility to satisfy all or a portion of the
Reserve Account Requirement.

Disqualified Bonds. Bonds owned or held by or for the account of the Agency or the City shall not be
deemed Outstanding for the purpose of any consent or other action or any calculation of Outstanding Bonds
provided for in the Indenture, and shall not be entitled to consent to, or take any other action provided for in the
Indenture.

Endorsement or Replacement of Bonds After Amendment. After the effective date of any action taken as
provided in the Indenture, the Agency may determine that the Bonds may bear a notation, by endorsement in form
approved by the Agency, as to such action, and in that case upon demand of the Owner of any Bond Outstanding at
such effective date and presentation of his Bond for the purpose at the office of the Trustee or at such additional
offices as the Trustee may select and designate for that purpose, a suitable notation as to such action shall be made
on such Bond. If the Agency shall so determine, new Bonds so modified as, in the opinion of the Agency, shall be
necessary to conform to such action shall be prepared and executed, and in that case upon demand of the Owner of
any Bond Outstanding at such effective date such new Bonds shall be exchanged at the office of the Trustee or at
such additional offices as the Trustee may select and designate for that purpose, without cost to each Owner, for
Bonds then Outstanding, upon surrender of such Outstanding Bonds.

Amendment by Mutual Consent. The provisions of the Indenture shall not prevent any Owner from
accepting any amendment as to the particular Bonds held by him, provided that due notation thereof is made on such
Bonds.

Notice to Rating Agencies. The Agency shall provide each rating agency rating the Bonds with a notice of

any amendment to the Indenture pursuant to the Indenture and a copy of any Supplemental Indenture.

A-25

Events of Default and Remedies of Owners

Events of Default and Acceleration of Maturities.

“Events of Default”) shall happen, that is to say:

If one or more of the following events (herein called

(a)

If default shall be made in the due and punctual payment of the principal of or redemption
premium, if any, on any Bond when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity as therein
expressed, by declaration or otherwise;

(b)

If default shall be made in the due and punctual payment of the interest on any Bond when and as

the same shall become due and payable;

(c)

If default shall be made by the Agency in the observance of any of the agreements, conditions or
covenants on its part in the Indenture or in the Bonds contained, and such default shall have continued for a period
of thirty (30) days after the Agency shall have been given notice in writing of such default by the Trustee; provided,
however, that such default shall not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture if the Agency shall
commence to cure such default within said 30-day period and thereafter diligently and in good faith proceed to cure
such default within a reasonable period of time; or

(d)

If the Agency shall file a petition or answer seeking reorganization or arrangement under the
federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law of the United States of America, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall approve a petition, filed with or without the consent of the Agency, seeking reorganization under
the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law of the United States of America, or if, under the provisions
of any other law for the relief or aid of debtors, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control
of the Agency or of the whole or any substantial part of its property;

then, and in each and every such case during the continuance of such Event of Default, the Trustee may,
and upon the written request of the Owners of not less than twenty-five per cent (25%) in aggregate amount of Bond
Obligation, shall, by notice in writing to the Agency, declare the principal of all of the Bonds then Outstanding, and
the interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall
become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in the Indenture or in the Bonds contained to the
contrary notwithstanding.

If, at any time after the principal of the Bonds shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any
judgment or decree for the payment of the money due shall have been obtained or entered, the Agency shall deposit
with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all principal of the Bonds matured prior to such declaration and all matured
installments of interest (if any) upon all the Bonds, and the reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee, including
those of its attorneys and advisors, and any and all other defaults known to the Trustee (other than in the payment of
principal of and interest on the Bonds due and payable solely by reason of such declaration) shall have been made
good or cured to the satisfaction of the Trustee or provision deemed by the Trustee to be adequate shall have been
made therefor, then, and in every such case, the Owners of at least twenty-five per cent (25%) in aggregate amount
of Bond Obligation, by written notice to the Agency and to the Trustee, may, on behalf of the Owners of all of the
Bonds, rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences. No such rescission and annulment shall extend to
or shall affect any subsequent default, or shall impair or exhaust any right or power consequent thereon.

Application of Funds Upon Acceleration. All money in the funds and accounts provided for in the
Indenture upon the date of the declaration of acceleration by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture, and all Net
Tax Increment Revenues thereafter received by the Agency under the Indenture, shall be transmitted to the Trustee
and shall be applied by the Trustee in the following order:

First, to the payment of the costs and expenses of the Trustee, if any, in carrying out the provisions of the
Indenture, including reasonable compensation to its agents, attorneys and counsel and then to the payment of the
costs and expenses of the Owners in providing for the declaration of such event of default, including reasonable
compensation to their agents, attorneys and counsel;

A-26

Second, upon presentation of the several Bonds, and the stamping thereon of the amount of the payment if
only partially paid, or upon the surrender thereof if fully paid, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and
unpaid upon the Bonds for interest and principal, with interest on the overdue principal at the rate of interest on the
Bonds, and in case such money shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so owing and unpaid upon the
Bonds, then to the payment of such interest, principal, and interest on overdue principal without preference or
priority among such interest, principal, and interest on overdue principal, ratably to the aggregate of such interest,
principal, and interest on overdue principal.

Trustee to Represent Bondowners. The Trustee is irrevocably appointed (and the successive respective
Owners of the Bonds, by taking and owning the same, shall be conclusively deemed to have so appointed the
Trustee) as trustee and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Owners of the Bonds for the purpose of exercising and
prosecuting on their behalf such rights and remedies as may be available to such Owners under the provisions of the
Bonds, the Indenture, the Law and applicable provisions of any other law. Upon the occurrence and continuance of
an Event of Default or other occasion giving rise to a right in the Trustee to represent the Owners of the Bonds, the
Trustee in its discretion may, and upon the written request of the Owners of not less than twenty-five per cent (25%)
in aggregate amount of Bond Obligation then Outstanding, and upon being indemnified to its satisfaction therefor,
shall, proceed to protect or enforce its rights or the rights of such Owners by such appropriate action, suit,
mandamus or other proceedings as it shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such right, at law or in
equity, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture, or in aid of the
execution of any power granted in the Indenture, or for the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable
right or remedy vested in the Trustee or in such Owners under the Indenture, the Law or any other law. All rights of
action under the Indenture or the Bonds or otherwise may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Bonds or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such suit, action
or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in the name of the Trustee for the benefit and protection of
all the Owners of such Bonds, subject to the provisions of the Indenture.

Bondowners’ Direction of Proceedings. Anything in the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have the right, by an
instrument or concurrent instruments in writing executed and delivered to the Trustee, to direct the method of
conducting all remedial proceedings taken by the Trustee under the Indenture; provided, that such direction shall not
be otherwise than in accordance with law and the provisions of the Indenture, and that the Trustee shall have the
right to decline to follow any such direction which in the opinion of the Trustee would be unjustly prejudicial to
Bondowners not parties to such direction.

Limitation on Bondowners’ Right to Sue. No Owner of any Bond shall have the right to institute any suit,
action or proceeding at law or in equity, for the protection or enforcement of any right or remedy under the
Indenture, the Law or any other applicable law with respect to such Bond, unless (1) such Owner shall have given to
the Trustee written notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default; (2) the Owners of not less than twenty-five per
cent (25%) in aggregate amount of Bond Obligation then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the
Trustee to exercise the powers granted I the Indenture or to institute such suit, action or proceeding in its own name;
(3) such Owner or said Owners shall have tendered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses
and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; and (4) the Trustee shall have refused or omitted to
comply with such request for a period of sixty (60) days after such written request shall have been received by, and
said tender of indemnity shall have been made to, the Trustee.

Such notification, request, tender of indemnity and refusal or omission are declared, in every case, to be
conditions precedent to the exercise by any Owner of Bonds of any remedy under the Indenture or under law; it
being understood and intended that no one or more Owner of Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever by
his or their action to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of the Indenture or the rights of any other Owners of
Bonds, or to enforce any right under the Indenture, the Law or other applicable law with respect to the Bonds, except
in the manner provided in the Indenture, and that all proceedings at law or in equity to enforce any such right shall
be instituted, had and maintained in the manner provided in the Indenture and for the benefit and protection of all
Owners of the Outstanding Bonds, subject to the provisions of the Indenture.

Non-Waiver. Nothing in the provision of the Indenture, or in the Bonds, shall affect or impair the
obligation of the Agency, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the interest on and principal of the Bonds to

A-27

the respective Owners of the Bonds at the respective dates of maturity, as provided in the Indenture, out of the Net
Tax Increment Revenues pledged for such payment, or affect or impair the right of action, which is also absolute and
unconditional, of such Owners to institute suit to enforce such payment by virtue of the contract embodied in the
Bonds and in the Indenture.

A waiver of any default or breach of duty or contract by any Owner shall not affect any subsequent default
or breach of duty or contract, or impair any rights or remedies on any such subsequent default or breach. No delay
or omission by any Owner to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default shall impair any such right or
power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence therein, and every power and
remedy conferred upon the Owners by the Law or by the Indenture may be enforced and exercised from time to time
and as often as shall be deemed expedient by the Owners.

If any suit, action or proceeding to enforce any right or exercise any remedy is abandoned or determined
adversely to the Owners, the Trustee, the Agency and the Owners shall be restored to their former positions, rights
and remedies as if such suit, action or proceeding had not been brought or taken.

Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy in the Indenture conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or the
Owners is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy. Every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy given under the Indenture or now or hereafter existing, at law or in equity or by
statute or otherwise, and may be exercised without exhausting and without regard to any other remedy conferred by
the Law or any other law.

Defeasance

Discharge of Indebtedness. If the Agency shall pay or cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid, to
the Owners of all Outstanding Bonds the interest due thereon and the principal thereof, at the times and in the
manner stipulated therein and in the Indenture, then the Owners of such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to the
pledge of Net Tax Increment Revenues, and all covenants, agreements and other obligations of the Agency to the
Owners of such Bonds under the Indenture shall thereupon cease, terminate and become void and be discharged and
satisfied. In such event, the Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Agency all such instruments as may be desirable
to evidence such discharge and satisfaction, and the Trustee shall pay over or deliver to the Agency all money or
securities held by them pursuant to the Indenture which are not required for the payment of the interest due on and
the principal of such Bonds, other than the moneys, if any, in the Rebate Fund.

Bonds for the payment of which money shall have been set aside (through deposit by the Agency or
otherwise) to be held in trust by the Trustee for such payment at the maturity or redemption date thereof shall be
deemed, as of the date of such setting aside, to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in
the first paragraph of this section.

Any Outstanding Bonds shall prior to the maturity or redemption date thereof be deemed to have been paid
within the meaning and with the effect expressed in the first paragraph of this section if (1) there shall have been
deposited with the Trustee either money in an amount which shall be sufficient, or Federal Securities the principal of
and the interest on which when paid will provide money which, together with the money, if any, deposited with the
Trustee at the same time, shall be sufficient, to pay when due the interest due and to become due on such Bonds on
and prior to the maturity or redemption date thereof, the principal of such Bonds, and the premium, if any, due on
such Bonds, as verified by an independent nationally recognized certified public accountant, and (2) the Agency
shall have given the Trustee in form satisfactory to it irrevocable instructions to mail, as soon as practicable, a notice
to the Owners of such Bonds that the deposit required by (1) above has been made with the Trustee and that such
Bonds are deemed to have been paid in accordance with the Indenture and stating the maturity or redemption date
upon which money is to be available for the payment of the principal of such Bonds; provided that if only money is
deposited with the Trustee and no Federal Securities are deposited with the Trustee, there shall be no requirement of
verification by an independent nationally recognized certified public accountant of the sufficiency of the money.
With respect to Bonds which are to be redeemed, the Agency shall direct the Trustee to mail a notice of redemption
as provided in the Indenture.

A-28

Neither Federal Securities nor money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture nor interest or
principal payments on any such Federal Securities shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than, and shall
be held in trust for, the payment of the interest on and principal of such Bonds; provided, that any cash received
from such interest or principal payments on such Federal Securities deposited with the Trustee, if not then needed
for such purpose, shall, to the extent practicable and upon written direction of the Agency, be reinvested in Federal
Securities maturing at times and in amounts sufficient to pay when due the interest on and principal of such Bonds
on and prior to such maturity or redemption date thereof, and interest earned from such reinvestments shall be
deposited in the Debt Service and Reserve Fund. For the purposes of this section, Federal Securities shall mean and
include only such securities as are not subject to redemption prior to their maturity.

Unclaimed Moneys. Anything in the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, any money held by the
Trustee in trust for the payment and discharge of the interest on, or principal or prepayment premium, if any, on any
of the Bonds which remains unclaimed for two (2) years after the date when such interest on, or principal of or
prepayment premium, if any, on any Bonds have become due and payable, if such money was held by the Trustee at
such date, or for two (2) years after the date of deposit of such money if deposited with the Trustee after the said
date when such Bonds become due and payable, shall be repaid by the Trustee to the Agency, as its absolute
property and free from trust, and the Trustee shall thereupon be released and discharged with respect thereto and the
Owners shall look only to the Agency for the payment of such Bonds; provided, however, that before being required
to make any such payment to the Agency, the Trustee shall, at the expense of the Agency, cause to be mailed to the
registered Owners of such Bonds at their addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Trustee a notice
that said money remains unclaimed and that, after a date named in said notice, which date shall not be less than
thirty (30) days after the date of the mailing of such notice, the balance of such money then unclaimed will be
returned to the Agency.

Miscellaneous

Liability of Agency Limited to Net Tax Increment Revenues. Notwithstanding anything contained in the
Indenture, the Agency shall not be required to advance any money derived from any source of income other than the
Net Tax Increment Revenues for the payment of the interest on or the principal of the Bonds or for the performance
of any covenants contained in the Indenture, other than the covenants contained in the Indenture. The Agency may,
however, advance funds for any such purpose, provided that such funds are derived from a source legally available
for such purpose.

The Bonds are limited obligations of the Agency and are payable, as to interest thereon and principal
thereof, exclusively from the Net Tax Increment Revenues, and the Agency is not obligated to pay them except from
the Net Tax Increment Revenues. All of the Bonds are equally secured by a pledge of, and charge and lien upon, all
of the Net Tax Increment Revenues, and the Net Tax Increment Revenues constitute a trust fund for the security and
payment of the interest on and the principal of the Bonds, to the extent set forth in the Indenture. The Bonds are not
a debt of the City of Bakersfield, the State of California or any of its political subdivisions, and neither said City,
said State nor any of its political subdivisions is liable therefor, nor in any event shall the Bonds be payable out of
any funds or properties other than those of the Agency pledged therefor as provided in the Indenture. The Bonds do
not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation or restriction, and
neither the members of the Agency nor any persons executing the Bonds are liable personally on the Bonds by
reason of their issuance.

Benefits of Indenture Limited to Parties. Nothing in the Indenture, expressed or implied, is intended to
give to any person other than the Agency, the Trustee and the Owners any right, remedy or claim under or by reason
of the Indenture. Any covenants, stipulations, promises or agreements in the Indenture contained by and on behalf

and

Finally, to the General Operating Account (SE) to be applied to any lawful purpose of the Agency with

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agency shall not be required to make the foregoing deposit of Tax

A-42

whenever all Outstanding Bonds shall be deemed to have been paid pursuant to any of the provisions of the
Indenture, as the case may be.

All moneys received by the Agency and constituting Housing Set-Aside Revenues for the Project shall be

held and applied by the Agency in accordance with the provisions of the, and for the purposes set forth in, Law.

All other receipts of the Agency with respect to the Project, which other receipts do not constitute either

established by the Agency from time to time with respect to the Project, shall be deposited in the General Operating
Account (SE) to be applied to any lawful purpose of the Agency with respect to the Project.

The Agency covenants and agrees that all Tax Increment Revenues received and held by the Agency shall
be deposited, disbursed, allocated and applied solely to the uses and purposes forth in the Indenture and shall be

Not later than five Business Days prior to each Principal Payment Date, an amount equal to the
Principal Installment due and payable on any Series 2009B Term Bonds on such Principal Payment Date shall be

(d)

Concurrently with the transfer to the Trustee with respect to each February 1 and each August 1
Interest Payment Date, an amount, if any, necessary to be deposited in the Reserve Account to restore the balance on

Following receipt by the Trustee of the foregoing prescribed transfers and the corresponding prescribed

shall be administered and applied as provided by Section 5.07.

In the event that, on any of the foregoing transfer dates, the amount on deposit in the Bond Debt Service
Account is insufficient to pay the obligations coming due on the corresponding Principal or Interest Payment Date,
the amounts transferred to the Trustee shall be reduced pro-rata, in keeping with the status of the Series 2009B
Bonds and any Additional Bonds as parity debt obligations; and in the event that the amount on deposit in the Bond
Debt Service Account is insufficient to pay both the principal and interest coming due on any August 1 payment

Moneys in the Series 2009B Bond Proceeds Account shall be used and disbursed in the manner provided

Agency for such costs theretofore paid by it); provided that all expenditures of moneys in the Series 2009B Bond

The Agency warrants that each withdrawal from the foregoing account within the Redevelopment Special

Establishment and Administration of Debt Service and Reserve Fund and Accounts Within Such Fund

There is created a special trust fund to be held by the Trustee called the “Bakersfield Redevelopment
Agency, Debt Service and Reserve Fund (SE)” (the “Debt Service and Reserve Fund”). Within the Debt Service and
Reserve Fund, the Trustee shall establish (a) an Interest Account, (b) a Principal Account, (c) a Term Bonds Sinking
Account and (d) a Reserve Account.

All Tax Increment Revenues transferred to the Trustee by the Agency in accordance with Section 5.03 shall
be set aside by the Trustee in each Fiscal Year when and as received in the applicable account within the Debt
Service and Reserve Fund. All moneys in each of such accounts shall be held in trust by the Trustee and shall be
applied, used and withdrawn only for the purposes authorized in the Indenture.

(1)

Interest Account. Amounts transferred to the Trustee by the Agency pursuant to subsection (a) of
Section 5.03 shall be deposited in the Interest Account; provided that no deposit need be made into the Interest
Account if the amount contained therein is at least equal to the aggregate amount of the interest becoming due and
payable on all Outstanding Bonds on the Interest Payment Dates in such Fiscal Year. All moneys in the Interest
Account shall be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of paying the interest on the Bonds as it
shall become due and payable (including accrued interest on any Bonds purchased or redeemed prior to maturity).

A-44

(2)

Principal Account. Amounts transferred to the Trustee by the Agency pursuant to subsection (b)
of Section 5.03 shall be deposited in the Principal Account; provided that no deposit need be made into the Principal
Account if the amount contained therein is at least equal to the aggregate amount of principal of all Outstanding
Serial Bonds becoming due and payable on the Principal Payment Date in such Fiscal Year. All money in the
Principal Account shall be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of paying principal of the Serial
Bonds as they shall become due and payable.

(3)

Term Bonds Sinking Account. Amounts transferred to the Trustee by the Agency pursuant to
subsection (c) of Section 5.03 shall be deposited in the Term Bonds Sinking Account; provided no deposit need be

All moneys in the Term Bonds Sinking Account shall be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose
of purchasing or redeeming the Term Bonds in accordance with Section 2.04(b).

(4)

Reserve Account. Forthwith upon receipt of the proceeds of sale of the Series 2009B Bonds, the
Trustee shall deposit in the Reserve Account the amount prescribed by the Indenture. Thereafter, amounts, if any,
transferred to the Trustee pursuant to subsection (d) of Section 5.03 shall be deposited in the Reserve Account;
provided that no deposit need be made into the Reserve Account so long as there shall be on deposit therein an
amount equal to the Reserve Account Requirement. All money in or credited to the Reserve Account shall be used
and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of replenishing the Interest Account, the Principal Account or
the Term Bonds Sinking Account in such order, in the event of any deficiency in any of such accounts occurring on
any Interest Payment Date, Principal Payment Date or Sinking Account Payment Date, or for the purpose of paying
the interest on or the principal of the Bonds in the event that no other money of the Agency is lawfully available
therefor, or for the retirement of all Bonds then Outstanding; provided that, so long as the Agency is not in default
under the Indenture, any amount in the Reserve Account in excess of the Reserve Account Requirement shall be
withdrawn from the Reserve Account by the Trustee and transferred to the Agency for deposit in the General
Operating Account (SE) within the Redevelopment Special Fund; and provided further that, in the event that a
Reserve Account Credit Instrument is provided by the Agency to the Trustee for deposit in the Reserve Account,
any amount then on deposit in the Reserve Account in excess of the Reserve Account Requirement as a result of
such deposit of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument may, upon the Written Request of the Agency to the Trustee,
be withdrawn from the Reserve Account by the Trustee and transferred to the Agency for deposit in the General
Operating Account (SE) within the Redevelopment Special Fund.

All or any portion of the Reserve Account Requirement with respect to any series of Additional Bonds may
be satisfied by the provision of a policy of insurance, a surety bond, a letter of credit or other comparable credit
facility, which meets the requirements of the Indenture (each, a “Reserve Account Credit Instrument”), or a
combination thereof, which, together with moneys on deposit in the Reserve Account, provide funds in an aggregate
amount equal to the Reserve Account Requirement. Notwithstanding any provision of the Indenture to the contrary,
the Reserve Account Requirement for the Series 2009B Bonds may not be satisfied by the provision of a Reserve
Account Credit Instrument, nor shall moneys on deposit in the Reserve Account in satisfaction of that portion of the
Reserve Account Requirement relating to the Series 2009B Bonds be withdrawn from the Reserve Account for the
purpose of replenishing any deficiency in the Interest Account, the Principal Account or the Term Bonds Sinking
Account relating to payments of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on a series of Additional Bonds, the
Reserve Account Requirement for which has been satisfied through the provision of a Reserve Account Credit
Instrument.

Any Reserve Account Credit Instrument secured for the Bonds shall meet the following requirements:

(a)

A surety bond or insurance policy issued to the Trustee, by a company licensed to issue an
insurance policy guaranteeing the timely payment of debt service on the Bonds (a “Municipal Insurer”) may be
deposited in the Reserve Account to meet the Reserve Account Requirement if the claims paying ability of the issuer
thereof shall be rated, at the time of such issuance, “AAA” or “Aaa” by S&P or Moody’s, respectively.

(b)

A surety bond or insurance policy issued to the Trustee by an entity other than a Municipal Insurer
may be deposited in the Reserve Account to meet the Reserve Account Requirement if the claims paying ability of
the issuer thereof shall be rated, at the time of such issuance, “AAA” or “Aaa” by S&P or Moody’s, respectively.

A-45

(c)

An unconditional irrevocable letter of credit issued to the Trustee by a bank may be deposited in
the Reserve Account to meet the Reserve Account Requirement if the issuer thereof is rated, at the time of such
issuance, at least “AA” by S&P. The letter of credit shall be payable in one or more draws upon presentation by the
beneficiary of a sight draft accompanied by its certificate that it then holds insufficient funds to make a required
payment of principal or interest on the bonds. The draws shall be payable within two days of presentation of the
sight draft. The letter of credit shall be for a term of not less than three years. The issuer of the letter of credit shall
be required to notify the Agency and the Trustee, not later than 30 months prior to the state expiration date of the
letter of credit, as to whether such expiration date shall be extended, and if so, shall indicate the new expiration date.

If such notice indicates that the expiration date shall not be extended, the Agency shall deposit in the
Reserve Account an amount sufficient to cause the cash or permitted investments on deposit in the Reserve Account
together with any other qualifying credit instruments, to equal the Reserve Account Requirement on all outstanding
Bonds, such deposit to be paid in equal installments on at least a semi-annual basis over the remaining term of the
letter of credit, unless the Reserve Account Credit Instrument is replaced by a Reserve Account Credit Instrument
meeting the requirements in any of the foregoing subsections (a)-(c). The letter of credit shall permit a draw in full
not less than two weeks prior to the expiration or termination of such letter of credit if the letter of credit has not
been replaced or renewed. The Trustee shall draw upon the letter of credit prior to its expiration or termination
unless an acceptable replacement is in place or the Reserve Account is fully funded in its required amount.

(d)

The use of any Reserve Account Credit Instrument pursuant to this section shall be subject to
receipt of an opinion of counsel as to the due authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of such
instrument in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and, in the
event the issuer of such credit instrument is not a domestic entity, an opinion of foreign counsel. In addition, the use
of an irrevocable letter of credit shall be subject to receipt of an opinion of counsel to the effect that payments under
such letter of credit would not constitute avoidable preferences under Section 547 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
similar state laws with avoidable preference provisions in the event of the filing of a petition for relief under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or similar state laws by or against the issuer of the bonds (or any other account party under the
letter of credit).

(e)

The obligation to reimburse the issuer of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument for any fees,
expenses, claims or draws upon such Reserve Account Credit Instrument shall be subordinate to the payment of debt
service on the Bonds. The right of the issuer of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument to payment or reimbursement
of its fees and expenses shall be subordinated to cash replenishment of the Reserve Account, and, subject to the
second succeeding sentence, its right to reimbursement for claims or draws shall be on a parity with the case
replenishment of the Reserve Account. The Reserve Account Credit Instrument shall provide for a revolving feature
under which the amount available thereunder will be reinstated to the extent of any reimbursement of draws or
claims paid. If the revolving feature is suspended or terminated for any reason, the right of the issuer of the Reserve
Account Credit Instrument to reimbursement will be further subordinated to cash replenishment of the Reserve
Account to an amount equal to the difference between the full original amount available under the Reserve Account
Credit Instrument and the amount then available for further draws or claims. If (i) the issuer of a Reserve Account
Credit Instrument becomes insolvent or (ii) the issuer of a Reserve Account Credit Instrument defaults in its
payment obligations thereunder, the obligation to reimburse the issuer of the Reserve Account Credit Instrument
shall be subordinate to the cash replenishment of the Reserve Account.

(f)

If the revolving reinstatement feature described in the preceding paragraph is suspended or
terminated, the Agency shall either (a) deposit into the Reserve Account an amount sufficient to cause the cash or
Permitted Investments on deposit in the Reserve Account to equal the Reserve Account Requirement on all
outstanding Bonds, such amount to be paid over the ensuing five years in equal installments deposited at least semi-
annually or (b) replace such instrument with a surety bond, insurance policy or letter of credit meeting the
requirements in any of subsections (a)-(c) above within six months of such occurrence. In the event that the issuer
of the Reserve Account Credit Instrument defaults in its payment obligations or the issuer of the Reserve Account
Credit Instrument becomes insolvent, the Agency shall either (1) deposit into the Reserve Account an amount
sufficient to cause the cash or Permitted Investments on deposit in the Reserve Account to equal the Reserve
Account Requirement on all outstanding Bonds, such amount to be paid over the ensuing year in equal installments
on at least a monthly basis or (2) replace such instrument with a surety bond, insurance policy or letter of credit
meeting the requirements in any of subsections (a)-(c) above within six months of such occurrence.

A-46

(g)

Where applicable, the amount available for draws or claims under the Reserve Account Credit
Instrument may be reduced by the amount of cash or Permitted Investments deposited in the Reserve Account
pursuant to clause (a) of the preceding subparagraph (f).

(h)

The Trustee shall ascertain the necessity for a claim or draw upon the Reserve Account Credit
Instrument and to provide notice to the issuer of the Reserve Account Credit Instrument in accordance with its terms
not later than three days (or such longer period as may be necessary depending on the permitted time period for
honoring a draw under the Reserve Account Credit Instrument) prior to each interest payment date. Cash on deposit
in the Reserve Account shall be used (or investments purchased with such cash shall be liquidated and the proceeds
applied as required) prior to any drawing on any Reserve Account Credit Instrument. If and to the extent that more
than one Reserve Account Credit Instrument is deposited in the Reserve Account, drawings thereunder and
repayments of costs associated therewith shall be made on a pro rata basis, calculated by reference to the maximum
amounts available thereunder.

(5)

General Operating Account (SE). After making the deposits referred to in paragraphs (1) through
(4) above in such Fiscal Year, the Trustee shall transfer to the Agency for deposit in the General Operating Account
(SE) within the Redevelopment Special Fund all money then remaining in the Debt Service and Reserve Fund, and
the Agency may apply moneys in the General Operating Account (SE) to any lawful purpose of the Agency with
respect to the Project.

Investment of Moneys in Funds and Accounts

Moneys in the Costs of Issuance Fund and in the Interest Account, the Principal Account, the Term Bonds
Sinking Account and the Reserve Account within the Debt Service and Reserve Fund, upon the Written Request of
the Agency, shall be invested by the Trustee in Permitted Investments.
If such instructions are not provided, the
Trustee shall invest such funds described in Clause (e) of the definition of Permitted Investments. The obligations in
which moneys in the Interest Account, the Principal Account or the Term Bond Sinking Account are invested shall
mature prior to the date on which such moneys are estimated to be required to be paid out under the Indenture.

The obligations in which moneys in the Senior Debt Service Account or the Bond Debt Service Account
within the Redevelopment Special Fund are invested shall mature prior to the date on which such moneys are
estimated to be required to be paid out under the Indenture. Moneys in the General Operating Account (SE) or the
Series 2009B Bond Proceeds Account within the Redevelopment Special Fund may be invested by the Agency in
any investments permitted by law.

Any interest, income or profits from the deposits or investments of moneys in any of the accounts within
the Redevelopment Special Fund shall be deposited in the General Operating Account
(SE) within the
Redevelopment Special Fund. Any interest, income or profits from the deposits or investments of moneys in the
Costs of Issuance Fund shall be retained in said fund to be disbursed in accordance with Section 5.04. Any interest,
income or profits from the deposits or investments of moneys in any of the all other funds and accounts held by the
Trustee shall be deposited in the Reserve Account within the Debt Service and Reserve Fund to the extent necessary
to restore the balance on deposit in the Reserve Account to an amount equal to the Reserve Account Requirement,
and otherwise shall be transferred not later than August 15 annually to the Agency for deposit in the General
Operating Account (SE) within the Redevelopment Special Fund.

For purposes of determining the amount on deposit in any fund or account held by the Trustee under the
Indenture, all Permitted Investments credited to such fund or account shall be valued at the lower of cost or the
market price thereof (excluding accrued interest and brokerage commissions, if any); provided that Permitted
Investments credited to the Reserve Account shall be valued at market value (exclusive of accrued interest and
brokerage commissions, if any), and any deficiency in the Reserve Account resulting from a decline in market value
shall be restored to the Reserve Account Requirement no later than the next valuation date. Amounts and
investments in the funds and accounts held by the Trustee under the Indenture shall be valued at least annually not
later than the tenth day of August.

The Agency acknowledges that to the extent regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency or other
applicable regulatory entity grant the Agency the right to receive brokerage confirmations of security transactions as

A-47

If
they occur, the Agency specifically waives receipt of
requested in writing by the Agency, the Trustee will furnish the Agency periodic cash transaction statements which
include detail for all investment transactions made by the Trustee under the Indenture. The Trustee may make any
investments under the Indenture through its own bond or investment department or trust investment department, or
those of its parent or any affiliate. The Trustee or any of its affiliates may act as sponsor, advisor or manager in
connection with any investments made by the Trustee under the Indenture. The Trustee shall not be responsible for
any loss from any sale or liquidation of investments made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

such confirmations to the extent permitted by law.

Covenants of the Agency

Punctual Payment. The Agency will punctually pay the interest on and principal of and redemption
premiums, if any, to become due with respect to the Bonds, in strict conformity with the terms of the Bonds and of
the Indenture and will faithfully satisfy, observe and perform all conditions, covenants and requirements of the
Bonds and of the Indenture.

Against Encumbrances. The Agency will not mortgage or otherwise encumber, pledge or place any charge
upon any of the Tax Increment Revenues, except as provided in the Indenture, and will not issue any obligation or
security superior to or on a parity with the Bonds payable in whole or in part from the Tax Increment Revenues
(other than Additional Bonds).

Extension or Funding of Claims for Interest. In order to prevent any claims for interest after maturity, the
Agency will not, directly or indirectly, extend or consent to the extension of the time for the payment of any claim
for interest on any Bonds and will not, directly or indirectly, be a party to or approve any such arrangements by
purchasing or funding said claims for interest or in any other manner. In case any such claim for interest shall be
extended or funded, whether or not with the consent of the Agency, such claim for interest so extended or funded
shall not be entitled, in case of default under the Indenture, to the benefits of the Indenture, except subject to the
prior payment in full of the principal of all of the Bonds then Outstanding and of all claims for interest which shall
not have been so extended or funded.

Management and Operation of Properties. The Agency will manage and operate all properties owned by
the Agency and comprising any part of the Project in a sound and business-like manner and in conformity with all
valid requirements of any governmental authority relative to the Project or any part thereof, and will keep such
properties insured at all times in conformity with sound business practice.

Payment of Claims. The Agency will pay and discharge any and all lawful claims for labor, materials or
supplies which, if unpaid, might become a lien or charge upon the properties owned by the Agency or upon the Tax
Increment Revenues or any part thereof, or upon any funds in the hands of the Trustee, or which might impair the
security of the Bonds; provided that nothing contained in the Indenture shall require the Agency to make any such
payments so long as the Agency in good faith shall contest the validity of any such claims.

Books and Accounts; Annual Audited Financial Statements. The Agency will keep proper books of record
and accounts (and, as to the Debt Service and Reserve Fund, shall cause the Trustee to keep proper books of record
and accounts), separate from all other records and accounts of the Agency or the Trustee, as the case may be, in
which complete and correct entries shall be made of all transactions relating to the Project and the Redevelopment
Special Fund. Such books of record and accounts shall at all times during business hours be subject to the
inspection of the Trustee (who shall have no duty or obligation to inspect) or of the Owners of not less than ten per
cent (10%) of the aggregate amount of Bond Obligation or their representatives authorized in writing.

The Agency will prepare and file with the Trustee annually as soon as practicable, but in any event not later
than two hundred seventy (270) days after the close of each Fiscal Year, so long as any Bonds are Outstanding, an
audited financial statement of the Agency for the preceding Fiscal Year prepared by an Independent Certified Public
Accountant, which audited financial statement shall include a statement as to the manner and extent to which the
Agency has complied with the provisions of the Indenture as it relates to the funds and accounts established pursuant
to the Indenture.

A-48

Protection of Security and Rights of Owners. The Agency will preserve and protect the security of the
Bonds and the rights of the Owners, and will warrant and defend their rights against all claims and demands of all
persons. From and after the sale and delivery of any Bonds by the Agency, such Bonds shall be incontestable by the
Agency.

Payment of Taxes and Other Charges. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Agency will pay and
discharge all taxes, service charges, assessments and other governmental charges which may be lawfully imposed
upon the Agency or any properties owned by the Agency in the Project Areas, or upon the revenues therefrom, when
the same shall become due; provided that nothing contained in the Indenture shall require the Agency to make any
such payments so long as the Agency in good faith shall contest the validity of any such taxes, service charges,
assessments or other governmental charges.

Financing the Project. The Agency will commence the financing or refinancing of the costs of the Project
to be aided with the proceeds of the Bonds with all practicable dispatch, and such financing will be accomplished
and completed in a sound, economical and expeditious manner and in conformity with the Redevelopment Plan and
the Law so as to complete said financing or refinancing as soon as possible.

Taxation of Leased Property. Whenever any property in the Project is redeveloped by the Agency and
thereafter is leased by the Agency to any person or persons, or whenever the Agency leases any real property in the
Project to any person or persons for redevelopment, the property shall be assessed and taxed in the same manner as
privately-owned property (in accordance with the Law), and the lease or contract shall provide (1) that the lessee
shall pay taxes upon the assessed value of the entire property and not merely upon the assessed value of the
leasehold interest, and (2) that if for any reason the taxes paid by the lessee on such property in any year during the
term of the lease shall be less than the taxes that would have been payable upon the entire property if the property
were assessed and taxed in the same manner as privately-owned property, the lessee shall pay such difference to the
Agency within thirty (30) days after the taxes for such year become payable, and in any event prior to the
delinquency date of such taxes established by law.

Disposition of Property in Project Areas. The Agency will not, except as otherwise provided in the
Indenture, authorize the disposition of any real property in the Project Areas to anyone which will result in such
property becoming exempt from taxation because of public ownership or use or otherwise (except for public
ownership or use contemplated by the applicable Redevelopment Plan in effect on the date of adoption of the
Indenture, or property to be used for public streets or public off-street parking facilities or easements or rights of
way for public utilities, or other similar uses) if such dispositions, together with all similar prior dispositions on or
subsequent to the effective date of the Indenture, shall comprise more than ten per cent (10%) of the assessed
valuation (as shown on the most recent equalization assessment roll of the County) in the Project Areas.
If the
Agency proposes to make any such disposition which, together with all similar dispositions on or subsequent to the
effective date of the Indenture, shall comprise more than ten per cent (10%) of the assessed valuation (as shown on
the most recent equalization assessment roll of the County) in the Project Areas, it shall cause to be filed with the
Trustee a Consultant’s Report on the effect of such proposed disposition. If the Consultant’s Report concludes that
Bondholder’s security will not be materially impaired by such proposed disposition, the Agency may proceed with
such proposed disposition. If the Consultant’s Report concludes that Tax Increments will be materially reduced by
such proposed disposition, the Agency shall as a condition precedent to proceeding with such proposed disposition,
require that such new owner or owners either:

(1)

Pay to the Trustee, so long as any of the Bonds are Outstanding, an amount equal to the amount
that would have been received by the Agency as Tax Increment Revenues if such property were assessed and taxed
in the same manner as privately-owned non-exempt property, which payment shall be made within thirty (30) days
after taxes for each year would become payable to the taxing agencies for non-exempt property and in any event
prior to the delinquency date of such taxes established by law; or

(2)

Pay to the Trustee a single sum equal to the amount estimated by an Independent Redevelopment
Consultant to be receivable from taxes on such property from the date of such payment to the last maturity date of
all Outstanding Bonds, less a reasonable discount value.

A-49

All such payments to the Trustee in lieu of taxes shall be treated as Tax Increment Revenues and shall be

deposited by the Trustee in the Redevelopment Special Fund.

Amendment of the Redevelopment Plan. The Agency will not amend the Redevelopment Plan for the
Project (other than an amendment to extend the effectiveness of the Redevelopment Plan or the time limit for the
receipt of Tax Increment Revenues by the Agency) except as provided in this section.
If the Agency proposes to
amend the Redevelopment Plan (other than an amendment to extend the effectiveness of the Redevelopment Plan or
the time limit for the receipt of Tax Increment Revenues by the Agency), it shall cause to be filed with the Trustee a
Consultant’s Report on the effect of such proposed amendment.
If the Consultant’s Report concludes that Tax
Increment Revenues will not be materially reduced by such proposed amendment, the Agency may undertake such
amendment.
If the Consultant’s Report concludes that Tax Increment Revenues may be or will be materially
reduced by such proposed amendment, the Agency may not undertake such proposed amendment.

Tax Increment Revenues. The Agency shall comply with all requirements of the Law to insure the
allocation and payment to it of the Tax Increment Revenues, including without limitation the timely filing of any
necessary statements of indebtedness with appropriate officials of Kern County.

The Agency expressly finds and determines that the pledge, payment and setting aside of Tax Increment
Revenues as provided for in the Indenture is not subject to any limitation contained in Article XIIIB of the
Constitution of the State of California.

Further Assurances. The Agency will adopt, make, execute and deliver any and all such further
resolutions, instruments and assurances as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out the intention or to
facilitate the performance of the Indenture, and for the better assuring and confirming unto the Owners of the Bonds
of the rights and benefits provided in the Indenture.

Designation of the Series 2009B Bonds as Qualified Tax-Exempt Obligations and Exceptions from Rebate
Requirement. The Governing Board of the Agency finds that it reasonably expects that the amount of tax-exempt
obligations which are being and will be issued by the Agency, or by any other entity on behalf of the Agency, in
calendar year 2009 will not exceed $5,000,000, and designates the Series 2009B Bonds as qualified tax-exempt
obligations for purposes of Section 265(b)(3)(B) of the Code, and the Chair of the Governing Board and the
Executive Director, or either of them, are authorized to execute and deliver any appropriate certification to this
effect on behalf of the Agency. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Agency expects to be relieved of the
obligation to pay the Rebate Requirement based upon the small issuer exception of Section 148(f)(4)(D) of the
Code.

Tax Covenants; Rebate Fund. The Agency covenants that it will not take any action, or fail to take any
action, if any such action or failure to take action would adversely affect the exclusion from gross income of the
interest on any of the Series 2009B Bonds under Section 103 of the Code. The Agency will not directly or indirectly
use or permit the use of any proceeds of the Series 2009B Bonds or any other funds of the Agency, or take or omit to
take any action, that would cause any of the Series 2009B Bonds to be “private activity bonds” or “private loan
bonds” within the meaning of Section 141 of the Code, or “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Section 148(a) of
the Code, or to be “federally guaranteed” within the meaning of Section 149(b) of the Code. To that end, the
Agency will comply with all requirements of Section 148 of the Code to the extent applicable to any of the Series
2009B Bonds.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agency agrees that there shall be paid from time to
time all amounts required to be rebated to the United States pursuant to Section 148(f) of the Code and any
temporary, proposed or final Regulations as may be applicable to any series of Bonds from time to time.
In the
event that at any time the Agency is of the opinion that for purposes of this section it is necessary to restrict or limit
the yield on the investment of any moneys held by the Trustee under the Indenture, the Agency shall so instruct the
Trustee in writing, and the Trustee shall take such action as may be necessary in accordance with such instructions.

Pursuant to the foregoing and as recited in the Tax Certificate, the Agency expects that the Series 2009B
Bonds are and will remain exempt from any Rebate Requirement obligation.
In the event for any reason that the
Agency is later advised by Bond Counsel that it may be obligated to pay the Rebate Requirement, the Agency shall

A-50

fund established and maintained under

instruct the Trustee in writing to establish and the Trustee shall thereupon establish and maintain a fund separate
from any other
the Indenture designated as the “Rebate Fund.”
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture to the contrary, all amounts deposited into or on deposit in the
Rebate Fund shall be governed by this section and by the Tax Certificate (which is incorporated in the Indenture by
reference). The Agency shall cause to be deposited in the Rebate Fund the Rebate Requirement as provided in the
Tax Certificate. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, all money at any time deposited in the Rebate Fund shall
be held by the Trustee in trust for payment to the federal government of the United States of America. The Agency
and the Owners shall have no rights in or claim to such money.

Upon the written direction of the Agency, the Trustee shall invest all amounts held in the Rebate Fund in

Permitted Investments, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Tax Certificate.

Upon receipt of the Rebate Instructions required to be delivered to the Trustee by the Tax Certificate, the
Trustee shall remit part or all of the balances held in the Rebate Fund to the federal government of the United States
of America, as so directed. In addition, if the Rebate Instructions so direct, the Trustee shall deposit moneys into or
transfer moneys out of the Rebate Fund from or into such accounts or funds as the Rebate Instructions direct. Any
funds remaining in the Rebate Fund after redemption and payment of such series of Bonds and payment of any
required rebate amount, or provision made therefore satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be withdrawn and remitted to
the Agency.

The Trustee shall have no obligation to pay any amounts required to be remitted pursuant to the Indenture,
other than from moneys held in the funds and accounts created under the Indenture or from other moneys provided
to it by the Agency.

The Trustee shall conclusively be deemed to have complied with the provisions of the Indenture if it
follows the directions of the Agency set forth in the Rebate Instructions, and shall not be required to take any actions
thereunder in the absence of Rebate Instructions from the Agency.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the obligation of the Agency to remit or cause to be
remitted any required rebate amount to the United States government and to comply with all other requirements of
the Indenture and the Tax Certificate shall survive the defeasance or payment in full of such series of Bonds.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Indenture to the contrary, if the Agency shall provide to the Trustee
an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that any action required under the Indenture is no longer required, or that
some further or different action is required, to maintain the exclusion from federal gross income of the interest on
the Series 2009B Bonds pursuant to the Code, the Trustee and the Agency may conclusively rely on such opinion in
complying with the provisions in the Indenture, and the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be modified to that
extent.

Nothing contained in the Indenture shall be construed as prohibiting the issuance of any series of Bonds the
interest on which is not excludable from gross income under Section 103 of the Code, provided, that such series of
Bonds may be issued and the proceeds thereof used without violating any of the covenants in the Indenture as they
may apply to any other series of Bonds.

The Trustee

Appointment and Acceptance of Duties. The Trustee accepts and agrees to the trusts created by the
Indenture to all of which the Agency agrees and the respective Owners of the Bonds, by their purchase and
acceptance thereof, agree.

Duties, Immunities and Liability of Trustee.

(a)

The Trustee shall, prior to an Event of Default, and after the curing or waiver of all Events of
Default which may have occurred, perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in the
Indenture, and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into the Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee

A-51

shall, during the existence of any Event of Default (which has not been cured or waived), exercise such of the rights
and powers vested in it by the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a reasonable
individual would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

(b)

The Agency may, in the absence of an Event of Default, and upon receipt of an instrument or
concurrent instruments in writing signed by the Owners of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Bonds then Outstanding (or their attorneys duly authorized in writing) or if at any time the Trustee shall cease to
be eligible in accordance with subsection (e) below, or shall become incapable of acting, or shall commence a case
under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or
any public officer shall take control or charge of the Trustee or its property or affairs for the purpose of
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, shall, remove the Trustee by giving written notice of such removal to the
Trustee, and thereupon the Agency shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee by an instrument in writing.

(c)

The Trustee may, subject to (d) below, resign by giving written notice of such resignation to the
Agency and by giving notice of such resignation by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Owners at the addresses
listed in the Bond Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Agency shall promptly appoint a
successor Trustee by an instrument in writing.

(d)

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become
effective only upon acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.
If no successor Trustee shall have been
appointed and shall have accepted appointment within thirty (30) days of giving notice of removal or notice of
resignation as aforesaid, the resigning Trustee or any Owner (on behalf of himself and all other Owners) may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee, and such court may
thereupon, after such notice (if any) as it may deem proper, appoint such successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee
appointed under the Indenture shall signify its acceptance of such appointment by executing and delivering to the
Agency and to its predecessor Trustee a written acceptance thereof, and thereupon such successor Trustee, without
any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the moneys, estates, properties, rights, powers,
trusts, duties and obligations of such predecessor Trustee, with like effect as if originally named Trustee in the
Indenture; but, nevertheless, at the written request of the Agency or of the successor Trustee, such predecessor
Trustee shall execute and deliver any and all instruments of conveyance or further assurance and do such other
things as may reasonably be required for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor
Trustee all the right, title and interest of such predecessor Trustee in and to any property held by it under the
Indenture and shall pay over, transfer, assign and deliver to the successor Trustee any money or other property
subject to the trusts and conditions set forth in the Indenture. Upon request of the successor Trustee, the Agency
shall execute and deliver any and all instruments as may be reasonably required for more fully and certainly vesting
in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such moneys, estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and
obligations. Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee as provided in the Indenture, such successor
Trustee shall mail a notice of the succession of such Trustee to the trusts under the Indenture by first class mail,
postage prepaid, to the Owners at their addresses listed in the Bond Register.

(e)

Any Trustee appointed under the provisions of the Indenture shall be a trust company or bank
having the powers of a trust company, having a corporate trust office in California, having (or in the case of a bank
or trust company which is a member of a bank holding company system, the related bank holding company shall
have) a combined capital and surplus of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), and subject to supervision or
examination by federal or state authority. If such bank, trust company or bank holding company publishes a report
of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of any supervising or examining authority
above referred to, then for the purpose of this subsection the combined capital and surplus of such bank or trust
company shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so
published.
In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
subsection, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in the Indenture.

(f)

No provision in the Indenture shall require the Trustee to risk or expend its own funds or

otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties under the Indenture.

A-52

(g)

In accepting the trust created by the Indenture, the Trustee acts solely as Trustee for the Owners
and not in its individual capacity, and under no circumstances shall the Trustee be liable in its individual capacity for
the obligations evidenced by the Bonds.

(h)

The Trustee makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the compliance with
legal requirements of the use contemplated by the Agency of the funds under the Indenture. The Trustee is not
responsible for any of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Agency under the Indenture.

(i)

The Trustee shall not be responsible for the recording or filing of any document relating to the
Indenture or of financing statements (or continuation statements in connection therewith). The Trustee shall not be
deemed to have made representations as to the security afforded thereby or as to the validity, sufficiency or priority
of any such document, collateral or security of the Bonds.

(j)

The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Event of Default under the Indenture
unless and until a Responsible Officer shall have actual knowledge thereof at the Trustee’s principal corporate trust
office.

(k)

The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Agency or any other party of

any funds which the Trustee has released under the Indenture.

(l)

The Trustee shall provide a monthly accounting of all Funds held pursuant to the Indenture to the
Agency within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of such month and shall provide statements of account for
each annual period beginning August 2 and ending August 1, within 90 days after the end of such period. Such
accounting shall show in reasonable detail all financial transactions made by the Trustee during the accounting
period and the balance in any Funds and accounts created by the Trustee under the Indenture as of the beginning and
close of such accounting period.

(m)

All moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied or invested as provided in the
Indenture, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received but need not be segregated from other funds
except to the extent required by law.

The Trustee may appoint and act through an agent and shall not be responsible for any misconduct

(p)

The Trustee makes no representations with respect to any information, statement, or recital in, and
shall have no liability with respect to, any official statement, offering memorandum or any other disclosure material
prepared or distributed with respect to the Bonds.

Merger or Consolidation. Any company into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated or any company resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which it shall be a
party or any company to which the Trustee may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate trust business,
provided such company shall be eligible under the Indenture, shall succeed to the rights and obligations of such
Trustee without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act, anything in the Indenture to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Preservation and Inspection of Documents. All documents received by the Trustee under the provisions of
the Indenture shall be retained in its possession and shall be subject at all reasonable times upon prior notice to the
inspection of the Agency, the Owners of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds and shall be subject at all reasonable times upon prior notice to the inspection of the Agency, the Owners of
at
twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds, and their agents and
representatives duly authorized in writing, at reasonable hours and under reasonable conditions.

Execution of Instruments; Proof of Ownership. Any request, direction, consent or other instrument in
writing required or permitted by the Indenture to be signed or executed by Owners may be in any number of
concurrent instruments of similar tenor by different parties and may be signed or executed by such Owners in Person
or by agent appointed by an instrument in writing. Proof of the execution of any such instrument and of the
ownership of Bonds shall be sufficient for any purpose of the Indenture and shall be conclusive in favor of the
Trustee with regard to any action taken, suffered or omitted by either of them under such instrument if made in the
following manner:

(a)

The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument may be proved by the
certificate of any officer in any jurisdiction who, by the laws thereof, has power to take acknowledgments within
such jurisdiction, to the effect that the Person signing such instrument acknowledged before him the execution
thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution.

(b)

The fact of the ownership of Bonds under the Indenture by any Owner and the serial numbers of

such Bonds and the date of his ownership of the same shall be proved by the Bond Register.

Nothing contained in the Indenture shall be construed as limiting the Trustee to such proof, it being
intended that the Trustee may accept any other evidence of the matters stated in the Indenture which to it may seem
sufficient. Any request or consent of the Owner of any Bond shall bind every future Owner of the same Bond and
any Bond or Bonds issued in exchange or substitution therefor or upon the registration of transfer thereof in respect
of anything done by the Trustee in pursuance of such request or consent.

Amendment of the Indenture

Amendment by Consent of Owners. The Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Agency and of the
Owners may be amended at any time by a Supplemental Indenture which shall become binding when the written
consents of the Owners of sixty per cent (60%) in aggregate amount of Bond Obligation, exclusive of Bonds
disqualified as provided in the Indenture are filed with the Trustee. No such amendment shall (1) extend the
maturity of or reduce the interest rate on, or otherwise alter or impair the obligation of the Agency to pay the interest
or principal or redemption premium, if any, at the time and place and at the rate and in the currency provided in the
Indenture of any Bond, without the express written consent of the Owner of such Bond, or (2) permit the creation by
the Agency of any mortgage, pledge or lien upon the Net Tax Increment Revenues superior to or on a parity with the
pledge and lien created in the Indenture for the benefit of the Bonds, without the express written consent of the
Owner of such Bond, or (3) reduce the percentage of Bonds required for the written consent to any such amendment,
without the express written consent of the Owner of such Bond, or (4) modify the rights or obligations of the Trustee
without its prior written assent thereto.

The Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Agency and of the Owners may also be amended at any
time by a Supplemental Indenture which shall become binding upon adoption, without the consent of any Owners,
but only to the extent permitted by law and only for any one or more of the following purposes:

(a)

To add to the covenants and agreements of the Agency in the Indenture contained, other covenants
and agreements thereafter to be observed, or to surrender any right or power in the Indenture reserved to or
conferred upon the Agency;

(b)

To make such provisions for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, or of curing, correcting or
supplementing any defective provision contained in the Indenture, or in regard to questions arising under the
Indenture, as the Agency may deem necessary or desirable and not inconsistent with the Indenture, and which shall
not materially adversely affect the interests of the Owners of the Bonds;

(c)

To provide for the issuance of any Additional Bonds, and to provide the terms and conditions
under which such Additional Bonds may be issued, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture;

A-54

(d)

To modify, amend or supplement the Indenture in such manner as to permit the qualification of the
Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or any similar federal statute hereafter in effect, and to
add such other terms, conditions and provisions as may be permitted by said act or similar federal statute, and which
shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the Owners of the Bonds;

(e)

To maintain the exclusion of interest on Tax-Exempt Bonds from gross income for Federal

income tax purposes; or

(f)

To obtain a bond insurance policy or a rating on the Bonds, or in connection with obtaining a
policy of insurance, surety bond, letter of credit or other comparable credit facility to satisfy all or a portion of the
Reserve Account Requirement.

Disqualified Bonds. Bonds owned or held by or for the account of the Agency or the City shall not be
deemed Outstanding for the purpose of any consent or other action or any calculation of Outstanding Bonds
provided for in the Indenture, and shall not be entitled to consent to, or take any other action provided for in the
Indenture.

Endorsement or Replacement of Bonds After Amendment. After the effective date of any action taken as
provided in the Indenture, the Agency may determine that the Bonds may bear a notation, by endorsement in form
approved by the Agency, as to such action, and in that case upon demand of the Owner of any Bond Outstanding at
such effective date and presentation of his Bond for the purpose at the office of the Trustee or at such additional
offices as the Trustee may select and designate for that purpose, a suitable notation as to such action shall be made
on such Bond. If the Agency shall so determine, new Bonds so modified as, in the opinion of the Agency, shall be
necessary to conform to such action shall be prepared and executed, and in that case upon demand of the Owner of
any Bond Outstanding at such effective date such new Bonds shall be exchanged at the office of the Trustee or at
such additional offices as the Trustee may select and designate for that purpose, without cost to each Owner, for
Bonds then Outstanding, upon surrender of such Outstanding Bonds.

Amendment by Mutual Consent. The provisions of the Indenture shall not prevent any Owner from
accepting any amendment as to the particular Bonds held by him, provided that due notation thereof is made on such
Bonds.

Notice to Rating Agencies. The Agency shall provide each rating agency rating the Bonds with a notice of

any amendment to the Indenture pursuant to the Indenture and a copy of any Supplemental Indenture.

Events of Default and Remedies of Owners

Events of Default and Acceleration of Maturities.

“Events of Default”) shall happen, that is to say:

If one or more of the following events (herein called

(a)

If default shall be made in the due and punctual payment of the principal of or redemption
premium, if any, on any Bond when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity as therein
expressed, by declaration or otherwise;

(b)

If default shall be made in the due and punctual payment of the interest on any Bond when and as

the same shall become due and payable;

(c)

If default shall be made by the Agency in the observance of any of the agreements, conditions or
covenants on its part in the Indenture or in the Bonds contained, and such default shall have continued for a period
of thirty (30) days after the Agency shall have been given notice in writing of such default by the Trustee; provided,
however, that such default shall not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture if the Agency shall
commence to cure such default within said 30-day period and thereafter diligently and in good faith proceed to cure
such default within a reasonable period of time; or

A-55

(d)

If the Agency shall file a petition or answer seeking reorganization or arrangement under the
federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law of the United States of America, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall approve a petition, filed with or without the consent of the Agency, seeking reorganization under
the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law of the United States of America, or if, under the provisions
of any other law for the relief or aid of debtors, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control
of the Agency or of the whole or any substantial part of its property;

then, and in each and every such case during the continuance of such Event of Default, the Trustee may,
and upon the written request of the Owners of not less than twenty-five per cent (25%) in aggregate amount of Bond
Obligation, shall, by notice in writing to the Agency, declare the principal of all of the Bonds then Outstanding, and
the interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall
become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in the Indenture or in the Bonds contained to the
contrary notwithstanding.

If, at any time after the principal of the Bonds shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any
judgment or decree for the payment of the money due shall have been obtained or entered, the Agency shall deposit
with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all principal of the Bonds matured prior to such declaration and all matured
installments of interest (if any) upon all the Bonds, and the reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee, including
those of its attorneys and advisors, and any and all other defaults known to the Trustee (other than in the payment of
principal of and interest on the Bonds due and payable solely by reason of such declaration) shall have been made
good or cured to the satisfaction of the Trustee or provision deemed by the Trustee to be adequate shall have been
made therefor, then, and in every such case, the Owners of at least twenty-five per cent (25%) in aggregate amount
of Bond Obligation, by written notice to the Agency and to the Trustee, may, on behalf of the Owners of all of the
Bonds, rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences. No such rescission and annulment shall extend to
or shall affect any subsequent default, or shall impair or exhaust any right or power consequent thereon.

Application of Funds Upon Acceleration. All money in the funds and accounts provided for in the
Indenture upon the date of the declaration of acceleration by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture, and all Net
Tax Increment Revenues thereafter received by the Agency under the Indenture, shall be transmitted to the Trustee
and shall be applied by the Trustee in the following order:

First, to the payment of the costs and expenses of the Trustee, if any, in carrying out the provisions of the
Indenture, including reasonable compensation to its agents, attorneys and counsel and then to the payment of the
costs and expenses of the Owners in providing for the declaration of such event of default, including reasonable
compensation to their agents, attorneys and counsel;

Second, upon presentation of the several Bonds, and the stamping thereon of the amount of the payment if
only partially paid, or upon the surrender thereof if fully paid, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and
unpaid upon the Bonds for interest and principal, with interest on the overdue principal at the rate of interest on the
Bonds, and in case such money shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so owing and unpaid upon the
Bonds, then to the payment of such interest, principal, and interest on overdue principal without preference or
priority among such interest, principal, and interest on overdue principal, ratably to the aggregate of such interest,
principal, and interest on overdue principal.

Trustee to Represent Bondowners. The Trustee is irrevocably appointed (and the successive respective
Owners of the Bonds, by taking and owning the same, shall be conclusively deemed to have so appointed the
Trustee) as trustee and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Owners of the Bonds for the purpose of exercising and
prosecuting on their behalf such rights and remedies as may be available to such Owners under the provisions of the
Bonds, the Indenture, the Law and applicable provisions of any other law. Upon the occurrence and continuance of
an Event of Default or other occasion giving rise to a right in the Trustee to represent the Owners of the Bonds, the
Trustee in its discretion may, and upon the written request of the Owners of not less than twenty-five per cent (25%)
in aggregate amount of Bond Obligation then Outstanding, and upon being indemnified to its satisfaction therefor,
shall, proceed to protect or enforce its rights or the rights of such Owners by such appropriate action, suit,
mandamus or other proceedings as it shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such right, at law or in
equity, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture, or in aid of the
execution of any power granted in the Indenture, or for the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable

A-56

right or remedy vested in the Trustee or in such Owners under the Indenture, the Law or any other law. All rights of
action under the Indenture or the Bonds or otherwise may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Bonds or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such suit, action
or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in the name of the Trustee for the benefit and protection of
all the Owners of such Bonds, subject to the provisions of the Indenture.

Bondowners’ Direction of Proceedings. Anything in the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have the right, by an
instrument or concurrent instruments in writing executed and delivered to the Trustee, to direct the method of
conducting all remedial proceedings taken by the Trustee under the Indenture; provided, that such direction shall not
be otherwise than in accordance with law and the provisions of the Indenture, and that the Trustee shall have the
right to decline to follow any such direction which in the opinion of the Trustee would be unjustly prejudicial to
Bondowners not parties to such direction.

Limitation on Bondowners’ Right to Sue. No Owner of any Bond shall have the right to institute any suit,
action or proceeding at law or in equity, for the protection or enforcement of any right or remedy under the
Indenture, the Law or any other applicable law with respect to such Bond, unless (1) such Owner shall have given to
the Trustee written notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default; (2) the Owners of not less than twenty-five per
cent (25%) in aggregate amount of Bond Obligation then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the
Trustee to exercise the powers granted I the Indenture or to institute such suit, action or proceeding in its own name;
(3) such Owner or said Owners shall have tendered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses
and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; and (4) the Trustee shall have refused or omitted to
comply with such request for a period of sixty (60) days after such written request shall have been received by, and
said tender of indemnity shall have been made to, the Trustee.

Such notification, request, tender of indemnity and refusal or omission are declared, in every case, to be
conditions precedent to the exercise by any Owner of Bonds of any remedy under the Indenture or under law; it
being understood and intended that no one or more Owner of Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever by
his or their action to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of the Indenture or the rights of any other Owners of
Bonds, or to enforce any right under the Indenture, the Law or other applicable law with respect to the Bonds, except
in the manner provided in the Indenture, and that all proceedings at law or in equity to enforce any such right shall
be instituted, had and maintained in the manner provided in the Indenture and for the benefit and protection of all
Owners of the Outstanding Bonds, subject to the provisions of the Indenture.

Non-Waiver. Nothing in the provision of the Indenture, or in the Bonds, shall affect or impair the
obligation of the Agency, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the interest on and principal of the Bonds to
the respective Owners of the Bonds at the respective dates of maturity, as provided in the Indenture, out of the Net
Tax Increment Revenues pledged for such payment, or affect or impair the right of action, which is also absolute and
unconditional, of such Owners to institute suit to enforce such payment by virtue of the contract embodied in the
Bonds and in the Indenture.

A waiver of any default or breach of duty or contract by any Owner shall not affect any subsequent default
or breach of duty or contract, or impair any rights or remedies on any such subsequent default or breach. No delay
or omission by any Owner to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default shall impair any such right or
power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence therein, and every power and
remedy conferred upon the Owners by the Law or by the Indenture may be enforced and exercised from time to time
and as often as shall be deemed expedient by the Owners.

If any suit, action or proceeding to enforce any right or exercise any remedy is abandoned or determined
adversely to the Owners, the Trustee, the Agency and the Owners shall be restored to their former positions, rights
and remedies as if such suit, action or proceeding had not been brought or taken.

Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy in the Indenture conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or the
Owners is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy. Every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy given under the Indenture or now or hereafter existing, at law or in equity or by

A-57

statute or otherwise, and may be exercised without exhausting and without regard to any other remedy conferred by
the Law or any other law.

Defeasance

Discharge of Indebtedness. If the Agency shall pay or cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid, to
the Owners of all Outstanding Bonds the interest due thereon and the principal thereof, at the times and in the
manner stipulated therein and in the Indenture, then the Owners of such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to the
pledge of Net Tax Increment Revenues, and all covenants, agreements and other obligations of the Agency to the
Owners of such Bonds under the Indenture shall thereupon cease, terminate and become void and be discharged and
satisfied. In such event, the Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Agency all such instruments as may be desirable
to evidence such discharge and satisfaction, and the Trustee shall pay over or deliver to the Agency all money or
securities held by them pursuant to the Indenture which are not required for the payment of the interest due on and
the principal of such Bonds, other than the moneys, if any, in the Rebate Fund.

Bonds for the payment of which money shall have been set aside (through deposit by the Agency or
otherwise) to be held in trust by the Trustee for such payment at the maturity or redemption date thereof shall be
deemed, as of the date of such setting aside, to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in
the first paragraph of this section.

Any Outstanding Bonds shall prior to the maturity or redemption date thereof be deemed to have been paid
within the meaning and with the effect expressed in the first paragraph of this section if (1) there shall have been
deposited with the Trustee either money in an amount which shall be sufficient, or Federal Securities the principal of
and the interest on which when paid will provide money which, together with the money, if any, deposited with the
Trustee at the same time, shall be sufficient, to pay when due the interest due and to become due on such Bonds on
and prior to the maturity or redemption date thereof, the principal of such Bonds, and the premium, if any, due on
such Bonds, as verified by an independent nationally recognized certified public accountant, and (2) the Agency
shall have given the Trustee in form satisfactory to it irrevocable instructions to mail, as soon as practicable, a notice
to the Owners of such Bonds that the deposit required by (1) above has been made with the Trustee and that such
Bonds are deemed to have been paid in accordance with the Indenture and stating the maturity or redemption date
upon which money is to be available for the payment of the principal of such Bonds; provided that if only money is
deposited with the Trustee and no Federal Securities are deposited with the Trustee, there shall be no requirement of
verification by an independent nationally recognized certified public accountant of the sufficiency of the money.
With respect to Bonds which are to be redeemed, the Agency shall direct the Trustee to mail a notice of redemption
as provided in the Indenture.

Neither Federal Securities nor money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture nor interest or
principal payments on any such Federal Securities shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than, and shall
be held in trust for, the payment of the interest on and principal of such Bonds; provided, that any cash received
from such interest or principal payments on such Federal Securities deposited with the Trustee, if not then needed
for such purpose, shall, to the extent practicable and upon written direction of the Agency, be reinvested in Federal
Securities maturing at times and in amounts sufficient to pay when due the interest on and principal of such Bonds
on and prior to such maturity or redemption date thereof, and interest earned from such reinvestments shall be
deposited in the Debt Service and Reserve Fund. For the purposes of this section, Federal Securities shall mean and
include only such securities as are not subject to redemption prior to their maturity.

Unclaimed Moneys. Anything in the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, any money held by the
Trustee in trust for the payment and discharge of the interest on, or principal or prepayment premium, if any, on any
of the Bonds which remains unclaimed for two (2) years after the date when such interest on, or principal of or
prepayment premium, if any, on any Bonds have become due and payable, if such money was held by the Trustee at
such date, or for two (2) years after the date of deposit of such money if deposited with the Trustee after the said
date when such Bonds become due and payable, shall be repaid by the Trustee to the Agency, as its absolute
property and free from trust, and the Trustee shall thereupon be released and discharged with respect thereto and the
Owners shall look only to the Agency for the payment of such Bonds; provided, however, that before being required
to make any such payment to the Agency, the Trustee shall, at the expense of the Agency, cause to be mailed to the
registered Owners of such Bonds at their addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Trustee a notice

A-58

that said money remains unclaimed and that, after a date named in said notice, which date shall not be less than
thirty (30) days after the date of the mailing of such notice, the balance of such money then unclaimed will be
returned to the Agency.

Miscellaneous

Liability of Agency Limited to Net Tax Increment Revenues. Notwithstanding anything contained in the
Indenture, the Agency shall not be required to advance any money derived from any source of income other than the
Net Tax Increment Revenues for the payment of the interest on or the principal of the Bonds or for the performance
of any covenants contained in the Indenture, other than the covenants contained in the Indenture. The Agency may,
however, advance funds for any such purpose, provided that such funds are derived from a source legally available
for such purpose.

The Bonds are limited obligations of the Agency and are payable, as to interest thereon and principal
thereof, exclusively from the Net Tax Increment Revenues, and the Agency is not obligated to pay them except from
the Net Tax Increment Revenues. All of the Bonds are equally secured by a pledge of, and charge and lien upon, all
of the Net Tax Increment Revenues, and the Net Tax Increment Revenues constitute a trust fund for the security and
payment of the interest on and the principal of the Bonds, to the extent set forth in the Indenture. The Bonds are not
a debt of the City of Bakersfield, the State of California or any of its political subdivisions, and neither said City,
said State nor any of its political subdivisions is liable therefor, nor in any event shall the Bonds be payable out of
any funds or properties other than those of the Agency pledged therefor as provided in the Indenture. The Bonds do
not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation or restriction, and
neither the members of the Agency nor any persons executing the Bonds are liable personally on the Bonds by
reason of their issuance.

Benefits of Indenture Limited to Parties. Nothing in the Indenture, expressed or implied, is intended to
give to any person other than the Agency, the Trustee and the Owners any right, remedy or claim under or by reason
of the Indenture. Any covenants, stipulations, promises or agreements in the Indenture contained by and on behalf
of the Agency or any member, officer or employee thereof shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Trustee
and the Owners.

Successor Is Deemed Included in All References to Predecessor. Whenever in the Indenture either the
Agency or any member, officer or employee thereof is named or referred to, such reference shall be deemed to
include the successor to the powers, duties and functions, with respect to the management, administration and
control of the affairs of the Agency, that are presently vested in the Agency or such member, officer or employee,
and all the agreements, covenants and provisions contained in the Indenture by or on behalf of the Agency or any
member, officer or employee thereof shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors thereof whether
so expressed or not.

Execution of Documents by Owners. Any request, consent, declaration or other instrument which the
Indenture may require or permit to be executed by Owners may be in one or more instruments of similar tenor, and
shall be executed by Owners in person or by their attorneys appointed in writing.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Indenture, the fact and date of the execution by any Owner or
his attorney of such request, consent, declaration or other instrument, or of such writing appointing such attorney,
may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds
to be recorded in the state or territory in which he purports to act, that the person signing such request, consent,
declaration or other instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness
of such execution, duly sworn to before such notary public or other officer.

The Trustee may nevertheless in its discretion require further or other proof in cases where it deems the
same desirable. The ownership of registered Bonds and the amount, maturity, number and date of holding the same
shall be proved by the registry books provided for in the Indenture.

A-59

Any request, consent, declaration or other instrument or writing of the Owner of any Bond shall bind all
future Owners of such Bond in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the Agency in good faith and in
accordance therewith.

Waiver of Personal Liability. No member, officer or employee of the Agency shall be individually or
personally liable for the payment of the interest on or principal of the Bonds; but nothing contained in the Indenture
shall relieve any member, officer or employee of the Agency from the performance of any official duty provided by
law.

Destruction of Cancelled Bonds. Whenever in the Indenture provision is made for return to the Agency of
any Bonds which have been cancelled pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Agency may, by a Written
Request of the Agency, direct the Trustee to destroy such Bonds and furnish to the Agency a certificate of such
destruction.

Funds and Accounts. Any fund or account required by the Indenture to be established and maintained by
the Agency or the Trustee may be established and maintained in the accounting records of the Agency or the Trustee
either as a fund or an account, and may, for the purposes of such records, any audits thereof and any reports or
statements with respect thereto, be treated either as a fund or as an account; but all such records with respect to all
such funds and accounts shall at all times be maintained in accordance with sound accounting practices and with due
regard for the protection of the security of the Bonds and the rights of the Owners.

Partial Invalidity.

If any one or more of the agreements or covenants or portions thereof provided in the
Indenture to be performed on the part of the Agency (or of the Trustee) should be contrary to law, then such
agreement or agreements, such covenant or covenants, or such portions thereof, shall be null and void and shall be
deemed separable from the remaining agreements and covenants or portions thereof and shall in no way affect the
validity of the Indenture or of the Bonds; but the Owners shall retain all the rights and benefits accorded to them
under the Law or any other applicable provisions of law. The Agency declares that it would have entered into the
Indenture and each and every other section, paragraph, subdivision, sentence, clause and phrase of the Indenture and
would have authorized the issuance of the Bonds pursuant to the Indenture irrespective of the fact that any one or
more sections, paragraphs, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases of the Indenture or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance may be held to be unconstitutional, unenforceable or invalid.

California Law. The Indenture shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of

California.

APPENDIX B 

ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 

CITY OF BAKERSFIELD 

The Bonds of each series do not constitute a general obligation debt of the City and the City 
has not pledged its full faith and credit to the repayment of the Bonds of any series.  The following 
information is presented for informational purposes only. 
General 

The City of Bakersfield (the (cid:147)City(cid:148)) is located in Kern County, California (the (cid:147)County(cid:148)), at the 
southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, approximately 110 miles north of Los Angeles and 290 miles 
south of San Francisco.  The City maintains an incorporated area of approximately 148 square miles, with 
an additional 170 square miles of land located within the City(cid:146)s sphere of influence. 

The  City  is  a  regional  center  for  industry,  government,  transportation,  retail  trade,  medical 
services,  and  oil  field  operations.    Major  manufacturing  activities  include  iron  and  steel  fabrication, 
plastic foam products, food products, petroleum refining, and textiles.  Bakersfield is one of the leading 
convention centers in the state and is the commercial hub of the County.  As the County seat, it is the 
location of many county, state, and federal offices. 

The metropolitan area has expanded considerably beyond the City limits.  As of January 1, 2008, 
the  estimated  population  of  the  County  was  817,517  and  the  estimated  population  of  the  City  was 
328,692, according to the California Department of Finance. 

City Government 

The City was incorporated on January 11, 1898, under the general laws of the State.  The City is a 
charter city with a council/manager form of government.  The City Council is comprised of seven council 
members, elected by ward on a staggered basis for a term of four years.  The mayor is directly elected for 
a four-year term.  The council appoints the City Attorney and the City Manager, who also serves as the 
Executive Director of the Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency (the (cid:147)Agency(cid:148)).  There are approximately 
1,503  permanent  City  employees,  including  199  general  governmental  employees,  290  public  works 
employees, 58 employees who work in wastewater or water services, 184 firefighters, 20 civilians who 
work  in  fire  protection,  352  police  officers,  134  civilians  who  work  with  the  police  department,  103 
employees  who  work  in  refuse  collection,  and  163  employees  who  work  with  culture  and  recreation 
services. 

Investment Policy of the City 

The City Council annually adopts and approves a policy with respect to the investment activities 
of the City and its related entities, including the Agency.  Idle cash in all funds is pooled for investment 
purposes except tax-exempt bond proceeds, which are separated for arbitrage record keeping as required 
by federal tax law, and the Fireman’s Relief and Pension Fund, which is administered separately by the 
City.  The investment policy is intended to provide guidelines for the prudent investment of the City(cid:146)s 
temporary idle cash, and outline the policies for maximizing the efficiency of the City(cid:146)s cash management 
system.  The ultimate goal is to enhance the economic status of the City while protecting the safety of its 
financial assets.  The City(cid:146)s present investment policy (the (cid:147)Investment Policy(cid:148)), which was adopted by 
the City Council on December 17, 2008, pursuant to Resolution No. 212-08, as summarized below: 

B-1 

 

Introduction.  The Investment Policy is intended to provide guidelines for the prudent investment 
of the City(cid:146)s temporary idle cash, and outline the policies for maximizing the efficiency of the City(cid:146)s cash 
management system.  It is the policy of the City to invest public funds in a manner which will provide 
safety of principal and at least a market rate of return while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the 
City.  Investments will conform to all statutes governing the investment of public funds. 

The primary goals of this policy are: 

•  To  assure  compliance  with  all  federal,  State  and  local  laws  governing  the  investment  of 

public funds under the control of the City Treasurer. 

•  To  maintain  the  principal  value  of  financial  assets  and  ensure  ample  liquidity  to  meet 

operating expenditures. 

•  Within the constraints of safety and liquidity, and within the parameters of the Investment 

Policy, generate a market rate of return. 

The ultimate goal is to enhance the economic status of the City while protecting the safety of its 

financial assets. 

Scope.  The Investment Policy applies to the investment activities of the City and related entities.  
Idle  cash  in  all  funds  is  pooled  for  investment  purposes  except  tax  exempt  bond  proceeds,  which  are 
separated for arbitrage record keeping as required by federal tax law, and the Firemen(cid:146)s Disability and 
Retirement  Fund,  which  is  administered  separately  under  the  City  of  Bakersfield  Municipal  Code 
Section 2.92. 

Investments made on a pooled basis include moneys of the City, the Agency, and the Authority.  
The pooled funds are accounted for in the City(cid:146)s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report ((cid:147)CAFR(cid:148)) and 
include: 

0XX  General Funds 
1XX  Special Revenue Funds 
2XX  Debt Service Funds 
3XX  Capital Project Funds 
4XX  Enterprise Funds 
5XX 
6XX  Fiduciary-Agency Funds 
 

Internal Service Funds 

Any new fund created, unless specifically exempted. 

All debt issue proceeds will be invested in accordance with the associated trust indenture, and in 

such a manner that facilitates arbitrage rebate calculations. 

Prudence.  Investments shall be made in the context of the (cid:147)prudent person(cid:148) standard: 

Investments  shall  be  made  with  judgment  and  care,  under  circumstance  then  prevailing  that 
persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for 
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable 
income to be derived. 

The  prudent  investment  diversification  for  the  City(cid:146)s  temporary  idle  cash  vs.  the  Firemen(cid:146)s 
Disability and Retirement Fund ((cid:147)FDRF(cid:148)) is different.  Up to 40% of the retirement fund may be invested 

B-2 

 

in securities of a single agency of the four triple-A rated United States Government Agencies authorized 
in this policy.  This exception to investment diversification among the highest quality securities is deemed 
prudent  and  necessary  in  order  to  increase  the  available  options  for  keeping  retirement  funds  fully 
invested at or above the six percent actuarial rate of return. 

Objective.  Criteria for selecting investments and the order of priority are: 

•  Safety - Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program.  The City 
only  operates  in  those  investments  that  are  considered  very  safe.    The  City  shall  seek  to 
preserve principal by mitigating the two types of risk, credit risk and market risk. 

•  Credit Risk - Potential loss due to the failure of an issuer of a security. 

•  Market Risk - Potential decrease in the value of securities due to changes in the general 

level of interest rates. 

•  Liquidity  -  Liquidity  refers  to  the  (cid:147)ability  to  easily  sell(cid:148)  at  any  moment  in  time  with  a 
minimal  risk  of  losing  some  portion  of  principal  and  interest.    Liquidity  is  an  important 
investment quality should the need for cash occur unexpectedly. 

•  Yield  -Yield  is  the  potential  dollar  earnings  an  investment  can  provide  and  is  sometimes 

described as the rate of return. 

Delegation of Authority.  In accordance with the City(cid:146)s Charter, Municipal Code, and subsequent 
resolutions,  the  City  Treasurer  is  authorized  to  invest  the  City(cid:146)s  funds  in  accordance  with  California 
Government  Code  Section 53600  et  seq.    The  City  Treasurer  shall  be  responsible  for  all  transactions 
undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. 

Ethics and Conflicts of Interest.  All officials involved with the City(cid:146)s investment program shall 
exercise  their  fiduciary  responsibly  as  custodians  of  the  public  trust.    The  City  Treasurer,  or  when 
appropriate the Treasury Supervisor, shall avoid any transactions that might impair public confidence in 
the City(cid:146)s ability to manage the investment of public funds in an effective manner.  The City Treasurer, 
Treasury Supervisor, or any other official charged with the responsibility of making investment decisions, 
shall have no vested interest in any investment being made involving public funds of the City, and shall 
gain no financial benefit from such investment decisions. 

Authorized Broker-Dealers and Banks.  All financial institutions that desire to do business with 
the City shall be evaluated by the City Treasurer to determine if they are adequately capitalized, meet 
California  Government  Code  requirements,  and  agree  to  abide  by  the  conditions  set  forth  in  the 
Investment Policy.  Whenever reasonable and in keeping with Government Code, investments are placed 
locally. 

Broker-dealers are investigated to determine if there is pending legal action against the firm or the 
individual broker who would be the City(cid:146)s contact and that the firm offers securities appropriate to the 
City(cid:146)s needs.  All broker-dealers, which may include (cid:147)primary(cid:148) dealers or regional dealers that qualify 
under  Securities  &  Exchange  Commission  Rule  15c3-1  (Uniform  Net  Capital  Rule),  who  desire  to 
become  authorized  bidders  for  City  investment  transactions  must  supply  the  City  Treasurer  with  the 
following: 

B-3 

 

•  Current audited financial statements 
•  Account authorization forms 
•  Proof of National Association of Securities Dealers certification 
•  Completed broker/dealer questionnaire 
•  Certification of having read and agreement to abide by the City of Bakersfield Investment 

Policy 

All banks that desire to become authorized bidders for time certificates of deposit ((cid:147)TCD(cid:148)) must 
be  a  qualified  public  depository  as  established  by  State  law  and  supply  the  City  Treasurer  with  the 
following:

•  Certification of having read and agreement to abide by the City of Bakersfield Investment 

Policy 

Broker-dealer  account  authorizations  and  depository  contracts  will  be  executed  by  the  City(cid:146)s 
Finance  Director  as  required  by  City  Charter.    The  City  Treasurer  will  maintain  a  list  of  authorized 
broker-dealers  and  banks  that  are  approved  to  do  business  with  the  City.    An  annual  review  of  the 
financial condition of authorized financial institutions will be conducted by the City Treasurer. 

Authorized and Suitable Investments.  The City(cid:146)s investment program is governed by California 
Government  Code  Sections  53600  et  seq.    Within  the  context  of  these  limitations,  the  following 
investments  are  authorized,  as  further  limited  herein  (Single  Asterisk  *  denotes  term  or  percentage 
imposed by State statute; Double Asterisk ** denotes term or percentage utilized by the City, which is 
more restrictive than statute): 

United States Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds 

United State Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds are securities which have the full faith and credit 
of  the  United  States  pledged  for  payment  of  principal  and  interest.    Although  there  is  no  percentage 
limitation of the dollar amount that can be invested in these categories, the (cid:147)prudent person(cid:148) standard 
shall apply.  Maturities are limited to five* years from settlement date. 

Treasury  Bills  (“ T-Bills” )  are  short-term  debt  obligations  of  the  United  States  Government, 
issued weekly with maturities up to one year.  T-Bills are considered to have virtually no credit risk and to 
be the most liquid short-term fixed income instrument.  Prices on T-Bills are quoted on a discount basis.  
The difference between the discount price and the full face value paid at maturity equals the total return. 

Treasury Notes (“ T-Notes” ) are initially issued by the auction process with two, five and ten year 
maturities.  T-Notes like Bills have virtually no credit risk and have liquidity through an active secondary 
market.  T-Notes are issued at Par ($1,000) with a coupon or fixed rate of interest.  The price or market 
value will fluctuate above or below par depending on the coupon rate and whether interest rates are rising 
or falling.  T-Notes mature at par. 

B-4 

 

Treasury Bonds (“ T-Bonds” ) are initially issued by the auction process with thirty year maturities 

and have characteristics similar to T-Notes. 

United States Government Agencies 

United States Government agencies include the Federal Farm Credit Bank System ((cid:147)FFCB(cid:148)), the 
Federal Home Loan Bank ((cid:147)FHLB(cid:148)), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ((cid:147)FHLMC(cid:148)), and 
the Federal National Mortgage Association ((cid:147)FNMA(cid:148)).  Government agencies issue debt in the form of 
discount notes, much like T-Bills, and notes and bonds similar to T-Notes and T-Bonds.  While agency 
debt is not a direct obligation of the U.S. government, it is rated AAA, the highest rating.  At the time of 
purchase no more than 20%** of the portfolio may be invested in any single agency name.  Maturities are 
limited to five* years from settlement date. 

Bankers Acceptance 

Bankers Acceptance ((cid:147)BA(cid:148)) is a time draft or bill of exchange, issued from a letter of credit, and 
is normally used to finance international trade.  When the accepting bank stamps (cid:147)accepted(cid:148) on the draft 
the bank guarantees payment of the draft at a specified future date and thereby creates an acceptance.  
BA(cid:146)s are considered extremely safe in that there has never been a default on a BA.  BA(cid:146)s trade on a 
discount basis and may not exceed 180* days to maturity.  No more than 10%** of the portfolio may be 
invested in BA(cid:146)s issued by any one bank.  No more than 40%* of the portfolio may be invested in this-
category.  Eligible BA(cid:146)s are those issued by banks with a short term debt rating of at least A-1 ** by 
Standard & Poor(cid:146)s Ratings Services ((cid:147)S&P(cid:148)) or P-1 ** by Moody(cid:146)s Investors Service, Inc. ((cid:147)Moody(cid:146)s(cid:148)). 

Commercial Paper 

Commercial Paper ((cid:147)CP(cid:148)) is a short-term promissory note.  CP is sold on a discount basis.  The 
maximum maturity is 270 days with most issued in the 30-50 day maturity range.  Eligible CP is (cid:147)prime(cid:148) 
quality ranked A-1 by S&P or P-1 by Moody(cid:146)s.  CP is issued by domestic corporations having assets in 
excess of $500 million and having an A or higher rating on its debt, other than CP, as provided by S&P or 
Moody(cid:146)s.  Purchases of eligible CP may not exceed 270* days to maturity.  No more than 10%* of the 
portfolio may be invested in CP issued by any one corporation.  No more than 25%* of the portfolio may 
be invested in this category. 

Repurchase Agreements 

Repurchase  Agreements,  commonly  called  (cid:147)Repos,(cid:148)  consist  of  two  simultaneous  transactions.  
One  is  the  purchase  of  securities  by  an  investor  (City)  from  a  bank  or  dealer.    The  other  is  the 
commitment by the bank  or dealer to repurchase the securities at the same price plus interest at some 
mutually agreed future date.  Normally the securities are U.S. Treasury notes or bonds and are held by a 
Federal Reserve Bank.  Repos can be done with banks or dealers with which the City has entered into a 
master repurchase contract that specifies terms and conditions of repurchase agreements.  The maturity of 
Repos  shall  not  exceed  90**  days.    No  more  than  30%**  of  the  portfolio  may  be  invested  in  this 
category. 

Local Agency Investment Fund 

Local Agency Investment Fund ((cid:147)LAIF(cid:148)) is a State-managed investment pool for local agencies 
within  the  State.    Investments  may  be  up  to  the  maximum  permitted  by  State  law  or  40%**  of  the 
portfolio whichever is less.  Due diligence will be exercised in monitoring the performance of LAIF on a 
continual basis. 

B-5 

 

Time Certificates of Deposit 

TCD(cid:146)s are similar to a savings certificate that anyone can purchase at a bank where there is a 
fixed rate of interest and a specified maturity date.  In the public funds area, TCD(cid:146)s are collateralized in 
accordance with California Government Code and are non-negotiable.  At the time of purchase no more 
than l0%** of the portfolio may be in TCD(cid:146)s of any one institution.  Maturity is limited to five* years.  
No more than 40%** of the portfolio may be invested in this category.  Section 53652 of the California 
Government Code also specifies that the City will have a deposit contract with each depository. 

Public Agency Savings Account - Demand Deposits 

Public Agency Savings Account - Demand Deposits are similar to a savings account that anyone 
can open at a bank.  The interest rate is specified at the time of deposit, but is subject to change.  All funds 
can be withdrawn on demand.  Like public TCD(cid:146)s, public agency savings accounts are collateralized in 
accordance with California Government Code requirements.  No more than 30%** of the portfolio may 
be invested in this category. 

Mutual Funds 

Mutual  Funds  are  money  market  funds  meeting  criteria  prescribed  in  California  Government 
Code Section 53601 and related legislation.  Investment in this category is limited to funds that invest in 
United States Government Securities and maintain a net asset value of one (daily liquidity).  The purchase 
price of shares shall not include any commission that these companies may charge.  No more than 10%* 
of  the  portfolio  may  be  invested  in  the  shares  of  any  one  mutual  fund.    No  more  than  20%*  of  the 
portfolio may be invested in this category.  Mutual funds are used for the investment of bond proceeds 
subject  to  arbitrage  reporting.    Due  diligence  will  be  exercised  in  the  selection  and  performance 
monitoring of mutual funds on a continual basis.

Should  any  investment  percentage  and  portfolio  limitation  be  exceeded  due  to  the  unexpected 
fluctuation in portfolio size, the affected securities may be held to avoid losses.  When market values are 
such  that  no  loss  is  indicated,  the  City  Treasurer  shall  consider  restructuring  the  portfolio  basing  the 
decision in part on the expected length of time the portfolio will be imbalanced. 

B-6 

 

Any  State  legislative  action  that  further  restricts  allowable  maturities,  investment  type,  or 
percentage allocations, will be incorporated into the Investment Policy and supersede any and all previous 
applicable language. 

Unauthorized  Investments.    Ineligible  investments  are  those  that  are  not  described  in  the 
Investment Policy, including but not limited to, negotiable time certificates of deposit, non-government 
agency medium term corporate notes, and reverse repurchase agreements. 

Collateralization.  Collateralization will be required on two types of investments, time certificates 
of deposit and repurchase agreements.  Investment in time certificates of deposit shall be insured up to 
$100,000 by the FDIC.  Investments in time certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000 shall be properly 
collateralized.    When  a  depository  pledges  government  securities  as  collateral,  section 53652  of  the 
California Government Code requires the securities to have a market value of at least 10% in excess of 
the City(cid:146)s deposit or 50% in excess of the City(cid:146)s deposit when mortgages are pledged as collateral.  Repo 
collateralization will be at least 102% of market value of principal and accrued interest. 

Safekeeping and Custody.  All security transactions entered into by the City shall be conducted 
on a delivery  versus-payment ((cid:147)DVP(cid:148)) basis.  Securities shall be delivered to the City by book entry, 
physical delivery or by third party custodial agreement. 

Diversification.  To reduce credit and market risk in the overall portfolio, the City will diversify 
its investments by security type, maturity date and issuer.  With the exception of U.S. Treasury securities, 
diversification  is  also  achieved  by  the  portfolio  percentages  and  maturity  limitations  indicated  in  the 
(cid:147)Authorized and Suitable Investments(cid:148) section of the Investment Policy. 

Maximum  Maturities.    To  the  extent  possible,  and  within  the  five  year  maximum  maturity 
required  by  California  Government  Code,  the  City  will  attempt  to  match  investment  maturities  with 
anticipated cash flow requirements. 

As required by California Government Code Section 53601, any investment term longer than five 
years requires express authority by the City Council to make that investment.  This authority  must be 
granted no less than three months prior to making the investment.  Investments with terms longer than 
five years will be limited to the lesser of $10 million or 10% of the portfolio at the time the investment is 
made. 

Internal Control.  Investment transactions are reviewed by the City(cid:146)s external auditor as part of 
the  annual  audit.    This  review  verifies  compliance  with  the  Investment  Policy  and  the  California 
Government Code. 

Performance Standards.  The cash management system is designed to accurately monitor and 
forecast expenditures and revenues, thus ensuring the investment of moneys to the fullest extent possible, 
including the estimated float for the Active Account and the Payroll Account.  The City attempts to obtain 
the  highest  interest  yields  possible  as  long  as  investments  meet  the  criteria  required  for  safety  and 
liquidity, do not exceed a term of five years (unless otherwise authorized by the City Council) and are 
within portfolio percentage limitations. 

The City strives to maintain the level of investment of all funds as near 100% as possible through 
daily and projected cash flow determinations.  The basic premise underlying the Investment Policy is, and 
will continue to be, to ensure that the money is always safe and available when needed. 

B-7 

 

Because  the  investment  portfolio  is  designed  to  operate  on  a  (cid:147)hold-to-maturity(cid:148)  premise  (or 
passive investment style) and because of the safety, liquidity, and yield priorities, the benchmark that will 
be used by the City Treasurer to determine whether market yields are being achieved shall be the yield on 
the U.S. Treasury Bill or Note maturing closest to the weighted average maturity of the City(cid:146)s overall 
portfolio. 

Reporting.  The City Treasurer shall provide the City Council monthly investment reports which 
provide a clear picture of the status of the current investment portfolio.  The monthly investment report 
shall include the following: 

•  A  listing  of  individual  securities  held  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  by  authorized 

investment category 

•  Final maturity of all investments listed 
•  Coupon, discount, or earnings rate 
•  Par value and market value 
•  Transactions completed during the month 
•  Percentage of the portfolio represented by each investment category 

Investment Policy Adoption.  The Investment Policy shall be reviewed annually by City staff and 

adopted by resolution of the City Council. 

Indemnification of Investment Officials.  The standard of care to be used by investment officials 
shall  be  the  (cid:147)prudent  person(cid:148)  standard  and  shall  be  applied  in  the  context  of  managing  the  overall 
portfolio.  The City Treasurer and his designees acting in accordance with established procedures and the 
Investment  Policy  and  exercising  due  diligence  shall  be  relieved  of  personal  responsibility  for  an 
individual  security(cid:146)s  credit  risk  or  market  price  changes,  provided  deviations  from  expectations  are 
reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. 

Tax Levies and Delinquencies; Assessed Valuation of Taxable Property 

The County Tax Collector collects ad valorem property tax levies representing taxes levied for 
each fiscal year on taxable real and personal property that is situated in the County as of the preceding 
March 1.  Unsecured taxes are assessed and payable on March 1 and become delinquent August 31, in the 
next fiscal year.  Accordingly, unsecured taxes are levied at the rate applicable to the fiscal year preceding 
the one in which they are paid. 

One half of the secured tax levy is due November 1 and becomes delinquent December 10; the 
second installment is due February 1 and becomes delinquent April 10.  A 10% penalty is added to any 
late installment.   

Property  owners  may  redeem  property  upon  payment  of  delinquent  taxes  and  penalties.    Tax-
delinquent properties are subject to a redemption penalty of 1.5% of the delinquent amount every month 
commencing on July 1 following the date on which the property became tax-delinquent.  Properties may 
be redeemed under an installment plan by paying current taxes, plus 20% of delinquent taxes each year 
for five years, with interest accruing at 1.5% per month on the unpaid balance.  If no payments have been 
made on delinquent taxes at the end of five fiscal years, the property is deeded to the State.  Such property 
may thereafter be conveyed to the County Tax Collector as provided by law.

OLD TOWN KERN-PIONEER REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT 

 
 

PROJECTED TAXABLE VALUES AND 

ANTICIPATED TAX INCREMENT REVENUES 

February 19, 2009 

Introduction 

 
I. 
 
The Bakersfield Redevelopment  Agency (the  Agency) is  proposing  to issue its  Tax  Allocation Bonds, 
Series  2009  A (Tax-Exempt  – Tax Increment  Revenue) (the Bonds).  The Bonds  will be secured by a 
pledge  of  the  tax  increment  revenues  derived  from  the  Old  Town  Kern-Pioneer  Project  (the  Project 
Area). 
 
The California Community Redevelopment  Law  (the Law) provides for the creation of redevelopment 
agencies  by  cities  and  counties  for  the  purpose  of  the  elimination  of  blight.    The  Law,  together  with 
Article 16, Section 16 of the California Constitution, authorizes redevelopment agencies to receive that 
portion of property tax revenue generated by project area taxable values that are in excess of the Base 
Year value.  The Base Year value is defined as the amount of the taxable values within the Project Area 
boundaries on the last equalized tax roll prior to adoption of the Project  Area.   The amount of current 
year taxable value that  is in excess of the Base Year value is  referred to as incremental taxable value.  
Tax  revenues generated from the incremental taxable value are generally  referred to as Tax Increment 
Revenues.  The Law provides that  the Tax Increment  Revenues may be pledged by the Agency to the 
repayment of Agency indebtedness. 
 
In this report, Tax Increment Revenues, including Unitary Tax Revenue (see Section IV.H, Allocation of 
State  Assessed  Unitary  Taxes)  are  referred  to  as  Gross  Revenues.    Gross  Revenues  less:  SB  2557 
County Administrative charges (see Section IV.G, County Collection Charges); the Housing Set-Aside 
Requirement  (see  Section  V,  Low  and  Moderate  Income  Housing  Set-Aside);  tax  sharing  and  any 
applicable  owner  participation  agreement  payments  (see  Section  VII,  Tax  Sharing  Agreements  and 
Other Obligations); and other obligations with a lien on revenue superior to debt service on the bonds; 
are referred to as Tax Revenues. 
 
The  purpose  of  this  Fiscal  Consultant’s  Report  (the  Report)  is  to  examine  the  current  fiscal  year  and 
project for subsequent fiscal years the amount of Tax Revenues to be received by the Agency from the 
Project  Area.    As  a  result  of  our  research,  we  project  the  Tax  Revenues  for  the  Project  Area  to  be  as 
shown in the table below (000’s omitted):

The Project Area 

 
 
These projections are based on assumptions determined by our review of the taxable value history of the 
Project  Area  and  the  property  tax  assessment  and  property  tax  apportionment  procedures  of  Kern 
County  (the  County).    Future  year  assessed  values  and  Tax  Revenues  are  projections  based  upon  the 
assumptions described in this Report, and are not guaranteed as to accuracy and this Report is not to be 
construed as a representation of such by HdL Coren & Cone. 
 
 
II. 
 
The Project Area, encompassing 1,971 acres in east Bakersfield was established by Ordinance No. 3904 
adopted on June 30, 1999. 
 
 
 
Table II A and II B illustrate the breakdown of land use in the Project Area by assessed value and are 
based  on  the  lien  date  tax  roll  for  fiscal  year  2008-09.   Unsecured  parcels  and  Secured  Non-Unitary 
Utilities are shown in brackets because they are, in reality, tax bills that are assigned to secured parcels 
already accounted for in other categories.

B.  Redevelopment Plan Limits 

 
 
 
 
The Project Area was adopted under the provisions of the Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1290 in 1993.  
Under the Law, as amended, project areas adopted after January 1, 1994 terminate their effectiveness not 
more than 30 years from the date of their adoption.  Loans, advances and other forms of indebtedness 
may  not  be  repaid  beyond  45  years  following  the  date  of  adoption  of  the  redevelopment  plan.  
Redevelopment plans adopted after January 1, 1994 are not required to have limits on the amount of tax 
increment that may be received annually or over the life of the plan.  The Plans do contain limits on the 
maximum amount of debt to be repaid with tax increment that may be outstanding at one time.  The plan 
limitations for the Project Area are summarized below.

Project Area Assessed Values 

 
 
III. 
 
 
 
Taxable  values  are  prepared  and  reported  by  the  County  Auditor-Controller  each  fiscal  year  and 
represent  the  aggregation  of  all  locally  assessed  properties,  which  are  part  of  the  Project  Area.    The 
assessments  are  assigned  to  respective  Tax  Rate  Areas  (each,  a  TRA)  that  are  coterminous  to  the 
boundaries of the Project Area.  The historic reported taxable values for the Project Area were reviewed 
in  order  to  ascertain  the  rate  of  taxable  property  valuation  growth  over  the  current  year  and  the  most 
recent six fiscal years beginning with 2003-04 (see Table 3).

B.  Top Ten Taxable Property Owners 

Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency 
Fiscal Consultant’s Report 
February 19, 2009 
 
Growth in assessed value of the Project Area from the 1998-99 base year, as revised in 2007-08 to 2008-
09  was  $271,882,964  (83.46%).    Between  2003-04  and  2008-09,  the  Project  Area  assessed  values 
increased by $231,872,771 (63.39%).  This growth has been led by additions to secured values.  From 
2003-04  through  2008-09  secured  values  have  increased  by  $215,419,724  (66.53%).   New  residential 
and  commercial  developments  account  for  the  major  increases  to  the  secured  roll.    Unsecured  values 
have  increased  in  every  year  since  2003-04.    From  2003-04  through  2008-09  unsecured  values  have 
increased by $16,453,047 (39.21%). 
 
Spurred by falling home prices, approximately 40,000 homes sold in Kern County between July 1, 2005 
and  June  30,  2007  were  examined  by  the  Assessor  for  Proposition  8  adjustments.    According  to  the 
Assessor, approximately 40,000 homes have experienced adjustments downwards in their assessed value 
to  more  accurately  reflect  the  market  level,  resulting  in  approximately  $2.7  billion  value  reduction 
County-wide.    The  County  Assessor  is  continuing  to  follow  the  housing  market  and,  at  this  time, 
recognizes  there  could  be  additional  homes  experiencing  adjustments  for  the  lien  date  of  January  1, 
2009.  
 
 
 
A  review of the top ten taxpayers in the  Project  Area  for  fiscal  year  2008-09  was  conducted.   For the 
Project  Area,  the  aggregate  total  taxable  value  for  the ten  largest  taxpayers  totaled $86,180,093.   This 
amount is 14.42% percent of the total assessed value and 31.70% of the incremental value of the Project 
Area.    The  top  taxpayer  in  the  Project  Area  is  CPT  Operating  Partnership,  on  two  secured  parcels 
representing  commercial  and  institutional  uses,  with  a  value  of  $16,958,519.    The  value  of  the  CPT 
Operating  Partnership  parcels  is  2.84%  of  the  total  assessed  value  and  6.24%  of  the  project  area’s 
incremental value.   Details on the top ten taxpayers are contained on the attached Table 5. 
 
IV. 
 
 
 
The  taxable  values  of  secured  and  unsecured  property  are  established  each  year  on  the  January  1 
property  tax  lien  date.    The  values  established  on  the  lien  date  are  the  values  to  be  enrolled  for  the 
coming fiscal year.  Real Property reflects the reported assessed values for secured and unsecured land 
and  improvements.    Pursuant  to  Article  XIIIA  of  the  State  Constitution,  the  value  of  locally  assessed 
Real Property may only be increased up to two percent annually to reflect inflation.  In most cases Real 
Property  values  are  permitted  to  increase  to  full,  current  market  value  as  a  result  of  a  change  of 
ownership or new construction.  Utility properties assessed by the State Board of Equalization may be 
revalued annually and such assessments are not subject to the inflation limitations of Article XIIIA.  The 
taxable  value of Personal  Property  is  also  established on the  lien date  and is  not  subject  to the  annual 
two percent limit of locally assessed Real Property. 
 
Secured property includes property on which any property tax levied by a county becomes a lien on that 
property.  Unsecured property typically includes value for tenant improvements, fixtures, inventory and 
personal  property.    A  tax  levied  on  unsecured  property  does  not  become  a  lien  against  the  taxed 
unsecured  property,  but  may  become  a  lien  on  certain  other  secured  property  owned  by  the  taxpayer.  
The taxes levied on unsecured property are levied at the previous year's secured property tax rate.

Supplemental Assessments

Chapter  498  of  the  Statutes  of  1983  provides  for  the  reassessment  of  property  upon  a  change  of 
ownership  or  completion  of  new  construction.    Such  reassessment  is  referred  to  as  the  Supplemental 
Assessment.    It  is  determined  by  applying  the  current  year's  tax  rate  to  the  amount  of  increase  in  a 
property's value and prorating the resulting property taxes to reflect the portion of the tax year remaining 
as determined by the date of the change in ownership or completion of new construction.  Supplemental 
Assessments become a lien against Real Property.  Since 1984-85, revenues derived from Supplemental 
Assessments have been allocated to redevelopment agencies and taxing entities in the same manner as 
regularly  collected  property  taxes.    The  receipt  of  Supplemental  Tax  Revenues  by  taxing  entities 
typically  follows the change of ownership by  a  year or  more.   The Agency has received supplemental 
revenues  for  the  Project  Area  in  the  amounts  of  $337,767  and  $474,584  for  fiscal  years  2006-07  and 
2007-08,  respectively.   We  have  not  included  projected  amounts  of  revenue  that  could  result  from 
Supplemental Assessments in our projections. 
 
 
 
The Project Area is comprised of 8 TRAs.   A TRA is  a geographic area within which the taxes on all 
property are levied by a certain set of taxing entities.  These taxing entities each receive a prorated share 
of the general levy and those taxing entities with voter-approved over-ride tax rates receive the revenue 
resulting from that tax rate. 
 
Tax rates will vary from area to area within the State, as well as within a community and a project area.  
The  tax  rate  for  any  particular  parcel  is  based  upon  the  jurisdictions  levying  the  tax  rate  for  the  area 
where the parcel is located.  The tax rate consists of the general levy rate of $1.00 per $100 of taxable 
values  and  the  over-ride  tax  rate.    The  over-ride  rate  is  that  portion  of  the  tax  rate  which  exceeds  the 
general  levy  tax  rate  and  is  levied  to  pay  voter-approved  indebtedness  or  contractual  obligations  that 
existed prior to the enactment of Proposition XIII. 
 
A  Constitutional  amendment  approved  in  June  1983  allows  the  levy  of  over-ride  tax  rates  to  repay 
indebtedness for the acquisition and improvement of real property, upon approval by a two-thirds vote 
of the electorate.  A subsequent amendment of the Constitution prohibits the allocation to redevelopment 
agencies of tax revenues derived from over-ride tax rates levied for repayment of indebtedness approved 
by the voters after December 31, 1988.  The over-ride tax rates typically decline each year as a result of 
(1) increasing property values (which would reduce the over-ride rate that must be levied to meet debt 
service) and (2) the eventual retirement of debt over time.  For all of the Southeast Project and Project 
Area  TRAs,  pre-1989  over-ride  tax  rates  include  debt  levied  for  the  Kern  County  Water  Agency  of 
0.049469 per $100 of assessed value.  All the TRAs also contain over-ride service debt rates for various 
school districts that were approved after 1988 and do not contribute revenue to the Agency.  The tax rate 
on unsecured property value in the current year is the secured tax rate from the prior year.  The secured 
tax increment projections are based on the published tax rates for 2008-09. 
 
Within  the  various  TRAs  within  the  Project  Area,  there  is  only  one  applicable  secured  tax  rate 
applicable to the Project Area tax increment, as illustrated by Table III-C below.  For the purposes of the 
projections, the tax rate of 1.049469% declines to 1% over ten years.

D.  Allocation of Taxes 

 
 
 
Secured  taxes  are  due  in  two  equal  installments.    Installments  of  taxes  levied  upon  secured  property 
become delinquent on December 10 and April 10.  Taxes on unsecured property are due  August 1 and 
become delinquent August 31.  The County disburses tax increment revenue to redevelopment agencies 
in monthly payments made August through July, with approximately 50 percent of annual revenue paid 
by December.  The Agency does not participate in a Teeter Plan.  The County bases its remittances on 
collections. 
 
 
 
A  review  was  made  of  the  receivable  and  allocated  tax  revenues  for  the  Project  Area  for  fiscal  years 
2003-04 through 2007-08.  Table III below shows the collection rates for the Project Area during these 
fiscal  years.  Collection rates are a comparison of  annual revenues apportioned to a project area to the 
amount  collected for the apportionment  year.   Revenues collected in July accrue to the previous fiscal 
year.  A collection rate of over 100 percent reflects the fact that roll changes occurred after the lien date 
that increased assessed values and resulted in a greater amount of revenue.  Amounts under the heading 
Prior Year Collections include supplemental revenues and redemption payments and do not include July 
payments.

F.  Assessment Appeals 

 
Assessment appeals granted under Section 51 of the Revenue and Taxation Code (also known as Prop 8 
Appeals) require that, for each subsequent lien date, the value of real property shall be adjusted to be the 
lesser  of  its  base  year  value  as  adjusted  by  the  inflation  factor  pursuant  to  Article  XIIIA  of  the  State 
Constitution  or  its  full  cash  value  taking  into  account  reductions  in  value  due  to  damage,  destruction, 
depreciation, obsolescence, removal of property or other factors causing a decline in value.  Significant 
reductions to residential assessed values have occurred in most counties due to adjustments to residential 
market  value.    Most  of  these  reductions  in  value  have  affected  residential  properties  that  were  sold 
during  the  2004  through  2007.    Reductions  made  under  this  code  section  may  be  initiated  by  the 

6 

G.  County Collection Charges

Fiscal Consultant’s Report 
February 19, 2009 
 
Assessor  or  requested  by  the  property  owner.    After  a  roll  reduction  is  granted  under  Section  51,  the 
property is reviewed on an annual basis to determine the full cash value of the property and the valuation 
is adjusted accordingly.  This may result in further reductions or in value increases.  Such increases shall 
be consistent with the full cash value of the property and, as a result, may exceed the maximum annual 
inflationary growth rate allowed on other properties under Article XIIIA of the State Constitution.  Once 
the  property  has  regained  its  prior  value,  adjusted  for  inflation  it,  once  again,  is  subject  to  the  annual 
inflationary  factor  growth  rate  allowed  under  Article  XIIIA.    (See  Section  X).   The  Assessor  has 
reviewed  the  values  of  40,000  residential  parcels  within  the  County  that  were  purchased  between 
January 2004 and December 2007.  This has resulted in Prop 8 reductions totaling $2.9 billion for 2008-
09.  The impact of these actions on the Project Area is relatively small but recovery of these value losses 
may occur over a number of years.  
 
Assessment  appeals  may  also  be  requested  as  adjustments  to  a property’s  base  year  value.    If  such  an 
appeal is granted with a change in value, the base year value of the property is adjusted accordingly and 
that  value  is  subsequently  adjusted  for  new  construction,  demolition  and  any  other  changes  requiring 
revaluation  of  the  parcel’s  land,  improvement  and  personal  property  values  and  by  the  annual 
inflationary factor growth rate allowed under Article XIIIA. 
 
Within the Project Area, there are three pending appeals by ACS Education Services Inc, one of the top 
ten taxpayers, requesting a $2,118,944 reduction in value.  There are three appeals on two parcels in the 
Project Area, filed by property owners that are not among the top ten taxpayers.   
 
 
 
Chapter 466 of the Statutes of 1990 allows counties to recover charges for property tax administration in 
an amount equal to their 1989-90 property tax administration costs, as adjusted annually.  The County 
collection charges for 2007-08 were $31,871 for the Project Area.  For purposes of our projections, we 
have  assumed  that  the  County  will  continue  to  charge  the  Agency  for  property  tax  administration  and 
that such charge will annually equate to 1.28% of the Project Area’s Gross Revenue for the remainder of 
the Projections (see Tables 1 and 2).   
 
 
 
Legislation enacted in 1986 (Chapter 1457) and 1987 (Chapter 921) provided for a modification of the 
distribution  of  tax  revenue  derived  from  unitary  property  owned  by  utilities  (except  railroads)  and 
assessed by the State Board of Equalization (SBE).  Unitary property is property owned by a utility and 
used in the operating function of the utility.  Non-unitary property is property owned by a utility and not 
used  in  the  functioning  of  the  utility.    Non-unitary  property  appears  on  the  tax  rolls  as  secured  utility 
property. 
 
Prior to the 1988-89 fiscal year, property assessed by the SBE was assessed statewide and was allocated 
according to the location of individual components of a utility in a TRA.  Commencing in 1988-89, tax 
revenues derived from unitary property are accumulated in a single TRA for the county and distributed 
to each taxing entity in the county in the following manner: (1) each taxing entity will receive the same 
amount  as  in  the  previous  year  plus  an  increase  for  inflation  of  up  to  two  percent;  (2)  if  utility  tax 
revenues are insufficient to provide the same amount as in the previous year, each taxing entity's share 
would  be  reduced  pro-rata  county  wide;  and  (3)  any  increase  in  revenue  above  two  percent  would  be 
allocated to all taxing jurisdictions in the county by a ratio determined by dividing each taxing entity's

share of the county's total secured tax levies for the prior year by the total secured levy of the county, 
exclusive of debt service. 
 
For  fiscal  year  2008-09,  the  County  Auditor-Controller  will  allocate  $5,911  in  unitary  revenue  to  the 
Project Area.  We have assumed the Agency will annually receive the same amount in future years. 
 
 
V. 
 
Section 33334.6 of the Law requires redevelopment agencies to set aside 20 percent of all tax increment 
revenues from project areas adopted prior to January 1, 1977 into a low and  moderate-income housing 
fund (the Housing Set-Aside Requirement).  An agency can reduce the Housing Set-Aside Requirement 
if it annually makes certain prescribed determinations that are consistent with the housing element of the 
general  plan.  These findings are:  (1) that no need exists in the community to improve or increase the 
supply of low and moderate-income housing; or, (2) some stated percentage less than 20 percent of the 
tax increment is sufficient to meet the housing need.  In order to make findings (1) or (2), the Agency's 
finding must be consistent with the housing element of the community's general plan, including its share 
of  the  regional  housing  needs  of  very  low-income  households  and  persons  and  families  of  low  or 
moderate  income.  No  such  findings  have  been  made  by  the  Agency  and,  thus,  20  percent  of  Gross 
Revenues have been projected as being set aside from the Project Area.  The Agency has been and will 
continue to set aside 20 percent of the Gross Revenues. 
 
 
VI. 
SB 211 was signed into law as Chapter 741, Statutes of 2001.  This legislation has two main impacts on 
the  limits  contained  in  an  agency’s  redevelopment  plan.    First,  a  city  council  may  eliminate  the  time 
limit  to  establish  indebtedness  in  redevelopment  project  areas  adopted  prior  to  January  1,  1994  by 
ordinance.    If  a  redevelopment  plan  is  so  amended,  any  existing  tax  sharing  agreements  will  continue 
and certain statutory tax sharing for entities without tax sharing agreements will commence in the year 
the eliminated limit would have taken effect.  Second, a city council may extend the time limit for plan 
effectiveness  and  repayment  of  debt  for  up  to  ten  years  if  it  can  make  certain  specified  findings.  
Because the Project Area was adopted after the effective date AB1290, the Project Area is not subject to 
the effects of SB211. 
 
In  order  to  address  State  Budget  deficits,  the  Legislature  enacted  SB  614,  SB  844  and  SB  1135  that 
required payments from redevelopment agencies for the 1992-93, 1993-94 and 1994-95 fiscal years into 
a countywide ERAF.  An agency could have used any funds legally available and not legally obligated 
for other uses, including reserve funds,  bond proceeds, earned income, and proceeds of land sales, but 
not  moneys  in  the  Low  and  Moderate  Income  Housing  Fund  (the  Housing  Fund)  to  satisfy  this 
obligation.    An  agency  could  have  reduced  its  payment  due  to  existing  indebtedness,  contractual 
obligations  and  90  percent  of  1991-93  administrative  costs  (collectively,  Existing  Obligations).    If  an 
agency could not make the required payment due to Existing Obligations, it could have borrowed up to 
50 percent of its 1992-93 contribution to the Housing Fund (which must be repaid within ten years), or 
the  agency  was  required  to  obtain  a  loan  from  the  city/county  in  order  to  pay  the  difference  between 
what the agency pays and the total amount due.  For agencies that did not borrow to meet any shortfall 
of the required payment, the county auditor-controller was required to deduct any amount due from the 

Legislation 

8 

Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency 
Fiscal Consultant’s Report 
February 19, 2009 
 
city/county's  allocation  of  property  taxes.    This  obligation  applied  to  the  agency  and  not  to  specific 
redevelopment  project  areas.    According  to  the  Agency,  it  has  no  outstanding  ERAF  obligations.    In 
addition to the payments from redevelopment agencies periodic State budget solutions have involved the 
shifting of property tax revenues from cities, counties and special districts to the ERAF. 
 
From 1994-95 to 2001-02 State Budgets were adopted with no additional shifting of tax increment from 
redevelopment  agencies;  however,  the  2002-03  State  Budget  required  a  shift  of  $75  million  of  tax 
increment statewide from redevelopment agencies to ERAF to meet the State budget shortfall.  AB 1768 
(Chapter 1127, Statutes of 2002) was enacted by the Legislature and signed by the Governor and based 
upon the methodology provided in the 2002-03 State Budget, the shift requirement for the Agency was 
$75,458  for  fiscal  year  2002-03  only.    The  Agency  made  the  required  payment  without  impacting  its 
payment of debt service and other obligations. 
 
As  part  of  the  State’s  2003-04  budget  legislation,  SB  1045  (Chapter  260,  Statutes  of  2003)  required 
redevelopment agencies statewide to contribute $135 million to local county ERAFs which reduced the 
amount  of  State  funding  for  schools.    This  transfer  of  funds  was  limited  to Fiscal  Year  2003-04 only.  
The amount of revenue that was transferred by the Agency to the Kern County ERAF for 2003-04 was 
$132,543.    The  Agency  made  this  payment  to  the  County  by  the  May  10,  2004  deadline  without 
impacting its payment of debt service on existing indebtedness. 
 
Under the Law, as amended by SB 1045, the Agency was authorized to use a simplified methodology to 
amend the individual  redevelopment  plans to extend by one  year the effectiveness  of the plan and the 
time during which the Agency may repay debt with tax increment revenues.  In addition, the amount of 
this  payment  and  the  ERAF  payments  made  in  prior  years  may  be  deducted  from  the  amount  of  the 
Project Area cumulative tax increment revenues.  The Agency intends to extend the Plans in the future 
pursuant  to  SB  1045.  These  extensions  of  time  are  not  reflected  in  the  projections  and  in  the  Project 
Area limits shown in Section II B. 
 
After  the  State’s  budget  for  2004-05  was  approved  by  the  Legislature  and  signed  by  the  Governor, 
Senate  Bill  1096  was  adopted.    Pursuant  to  SB  1096,  redevelopment  agencies  within  the  State  paid  a 
combined  total of  $250  million  to ERAF  in  each  of  fiscal  years  2004-05 and 2005-06 using  the  same 
formula  as  was  used  for  2003-04.    Annual  payments  were  due  on  May  10  of  each  fiscal  year.    As  in 
previous  years,  payments  were  allowed  to  be  made  from  any  available  funds  other  than  the  Housing 
Fund.  If an agency  was unable to  make a payment,  it was allowed to borrow up to 50 percent  of the 
current  year  Housing  Set-Aside  Revenues,  however,  such  borrowed  amounts  must  be  repaid  to  the 
Housing Fund within 10 years of the last ERAF payment (May 10, 2006).  The Agency’s portion of the 
statewide ERAF requirement for 2004-05 was $248,051.  The Agency’s 2005-06 payment amount was 
$286,573.  The ERAF requirements were subordinate to the payment of debt service on existing bonds 
and the Agency made such payments on time. 
 
SB  1096  made  provision  for  extensions  of  project  area  effectiveness  of  one  year  for  each  of  the  two 
payments required.  For project areas that have less than 10 years of plan effectiveness remaining after 
June 30, 2005, a one year extension is authorized.  For project areas that have more than 10 years and 
less than 20 years of plan effectiveness remaining after June 30, 2005, a one year extension is authorized 
if  the  city  council  can  make  certain  findings  that  the  redevelopment  agency  is  in  compliance  with 
specified  state  housing  requirements.    These  requirements  are:  1)  that  the  redevelopment  agency  is 

9 

Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency 
Fiscal Consultant’s Report 
February 19, 2009 
 
setting aside 20 percent of gross tax increment revenue; 2) housing implementation plans are in place; 3) 
replacement  housing  and  inclusionary  housing  requirements  are  being  met;  and,  4)  no  excess  surplus 
exists.  For those project areas  with more than 20 years of plan effectiveness  remaining after June 30, 
2005 no extension of time is authorized. 
 
The  Legislature  has  now  enacted  AB  1389  to  require  a  $350  million  shift  for  2008-09  from 
redevelopment  agencies  to ERAF.    There  will  be  no  repayment  of  this  amount,  nor  any  extensions of 
redevelopment plan limits.  The Housing Set Aside Requirement will not apply to the amount paid for 
the ERAF.  The amount the Agency will be required to pay is $571,840.  The payment may come from 
any available Agency revenues. A redevelopment agency may borrow up to 50 percent from its current 
year Housing Set-Aside Requirement for purposes of making the ERAF payment.   The ERAF payment 
is  subordinate  to  all  bonded  debt  issued  by  a  redevelopment  agency.    A  redevelopment  agency  that 
cannot make the payment due to existing indebtedness may borrow from their legislative body.  Failure 
to  make  the  ERAF  payment  will  result  in  penalties  that  effectively  stop  new  activities  of  a 
redevelopment agency. 
 
The  Agency  cannot  predict  whether  the  State  Legislature  will  enact  any  other  legislation  requiring 
additional  or  increased  future  shifts  of  tax  increment  revenues  to  the  State  and/or  to  schools,  whether 
through an arrangement similar to ERAF or by other arrangements, and, if so, the effect on future Tax 
Revenues. 
 
Legislation, AB 1389, enacted with the 2008-09 State Budget requires redevelopment agencies to report 
their  statutory  payments  pursuant  to  AB  1290  and  SB  211  to  their  county  auditors.    Redevelopment 
agencies are to report to their county  auditors their Statutory Payments  by each project  area, and each 
taxing agency for each of past five years (2003-04 through 2007-08) by October 1, 2008, and annually 
by October 1st for the next six years.  This information is to be consolidated by the counties and reported 
to  the  State  Controller.    The  State  Controller  is  then  responsible  for  disseminating  the  appropriate 
information, including redevelopment agencies whose calculations are determined by the counties to not 
be in concurrence with the requirements of AB 1290, to the Legislative Analyst, the State Department of 
Finance,  the  State  Board  of  Education,  and  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  California  Community 
Colleges. 
 
In the event of a dispute the redevelopment agency has 15 days to revise and resubmit its report, submit 
a  statement  of  dispute  identifying  the  issues,  amend  the  report,  or  submit  the  report  to  the  State 
Controller  with  the  county’s  analysis.    The  legislation  allows  the  State  Controller  to  revoke  a  county 
finding  of  concurrence  and  direct  an  agency  to  resubmit  a  report  to  the  county  if  the  Controller  finds 
significant errors in the report.  When the State Controller  submits its report to the Legislative Analyst 
and the Department of Finance it is required to summarize the statements of dispute including whether 
the Controller or other state entity has provided instructions as to how these disputes should be resolved.  
Ultimately, for agencies with unresolved disputes, the State Controller with the concurrence of the State 
Director of Finance, may waive the penalties and interest charges for late payments (see Penalties and 
Interest  below)  for  12  months  for  agencies  that  filed  a  statement  of  dispute  that,  in  the opinion of  the 
Controller, is likely to be resolved in a manner consistent with an agency’s position. 
 
After  February  1,  2009,  an  agency  listed  on  the  most  recent  State  Controller’s  report  for  which  the 
county  has  not  issued  a  finding  of  concurrence  or  that  has  outstanding  Statutory  payments  to  a  local 

10 

Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency 
Fiscal Consultant’s Report 
February 19, 2009 
 
educational agency, will be subject to penalties and interest charges.  The penalties, would prevent the 
agency  from  adding  new  project  areas  or  expanding  existing  areas,  issuing  new  bonds  or  other 
obligations including refunding, encumbering or expending any funds derived from any source except to 
pay  existing  loans,  contractual  obligations,  tax-sharing  agreements  or  housing  set-aside  deposits.  
Administrative  costs  would  be  limited  75  percent  of  the  average  monthly  amount  spent  on 
administration in the previous fiscal year. 
 
Such identified agencies would also incur interest costs on any Statutory Payment that is not paid by 60 
days after the close of the fiscal year in which the pass-through payment was required.  The interest rate 
would be 150 percent of the current Pooled Money Investment Account earnings annual yield beginning 
60 days after the close of the fiscal year for which the Statutory Payment was due.  The State Controller, 
with the concurrence of the State Director of Finance may waive the penalties and interest for up to 12 
months for agencies identified by as not in concurrence when a dispute by an agency that is likely to be 
sustained,  when  the  agency  has  paid  the  local  educational  agencies  or  had  the  county  withhold  a 
disputed amount, or if the agency would sustain a fiscal hardship if it made the payments in the amount 
estimated by the county auditor. 
 
Since  AB  1389  was  enacted  on  September  30th,  one  day  before  the  first  deadline,  it  is  taking 
redevelopment  agencies,  counties  and  the  State  Controller  longer  to  review  the  calculations  than 
specified in the legislation.  Kern County has concurred with the Agency’s calculations. 
 
 
VII.  Tax Sharing Agreements and Other Obligations 
 
A. 
The Project Area was adopted after January 1, 1994 and is, therefore, subject to the statutory tax sharing 
payments mandated in the Law as amended by Assembly Bill 1290.  These tax-sharing payments are set 
by statute and are not negotiated.  A prescribed portion of the Agency’s tax increment revenue must be 
shared with all taxing entities within the Project Area.  This defined tax-sharing amount has three tiers.  
The  first  tier  began  with  the  first  year  that  the  Project  Area  received  tax  increment  revenue  and 
continues  for  the  life  of  the  Project  Area.    This  first  tier  tax-sharing  amount  is  25  percent  of  the 
Agency’s  gross  tax  increment  revenue  net  of  the  Housing  Set-Aside  Requirement.    The  City  of 
Bakersfield may elect to receive its share of this first tier of tax-sharing payments.  If the City does not 
elect to receive its share, that amount of the tax sharing payment will remain with the Agency.   
 
The second tier begins in the eleventh year after the Agency first receives tax increment revenue.  This 
second tier is 21 percent of the tax increment revenue, net of the Housing Set-Aside Requirement, that is 
derived from the growth in assessed value that is in excess of the assessed value of the project area in 
year ten.  The City may not receive a share of the second tier tax-sharing payments. 
 
The third tier begins in the 31st year after the Agency first receives tax increment revenue.  This third 
tier is 14 percent of the tax increment revenue, net of the Housing Set-Aside Requirement that is derived 
from the growth in assessed value that is in excess of the assessed value of the Project Area in the 30th 
year.  The City may not receive a share of the third tier tax-sharing payments.  These three tiers of tax 
sharing are calculated independent of one another and continue from their inception through the life of 
the Project Area.

Fiscal Consultant’s Report

B. 
The Agency has committed tax increment funds to the repayment of loans from the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD).   The Agency contracted for loan guarantee assistance under 
Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to finance activities in the Project 
Area connection with a mixed-use project. 
 
 
VIII.  New Development 
A review of recent transfers of ownership has been conducted and a number of transfers were found to 
have  occurred  after  the  January  1,  2008  lien  date  for  the  current  fiscal  year.    These  transfers  of 
ownership  occurred  from  January  1,  2008  through  August  15,  2008.    As  a  result,  the  sales  values  on 
these transfers of ownership are expected to be reflected in the tax rolls for 2009-10. 
 
There  were  57  transfers  of  ownership  found  within  the  Project  Area.    Of  the  57  transfers,  one  buyer, 
Alfarooo Islamic Center appears to potentially be eligible for a  welfare exemption on two parcels  and 
the  County  of  Kern  purchased  one  parcel.      These  transfers  of  ownership  are  expected  to  result  in  an 
increase of value in the amount $8,381,561 to the 2009-10 tax roll.  In addition, based on data provided 
by  DataQuick,  there  are  32  parcels  in  foreclosure  with  outstanding  mortgages  that  may  result  in  a 
reduction of $1,472,972.   The impacts of these transfers are included in the Projections of Incremental 
Taxable Value and Tax Increment Revenue and shown in detail on Table 4 (New Development). 
 
 
IX. 
 
Growth in real property land and improvement values have been limited to an assumed rate of growth of 
real  property  taxable  values  of  two  percent  annually  as  allowed  under  Article  XIIIA  of  the  State 
Constitution.    A  two  percent  growth  rate  has  been  assumed  because  it  is  the  maximum  inflationary 
growth rate permitted by law and this rate of growth has been achieved in all but five years since 1981.  
The years in which less than two percent growth was realized were 1983-84 (1.0%), 1995-96 (1.19%), 
1996-97  (1.11%),  1999-00  (1.85%)  and  2004-05  (1.867%).    If  in  future  years  the  growth  of  taxable 
value  in  the  project  area  is  less  than  two  percent,  the  resultant  Tax  Increment  Revenues  would  be 
reduced. 
 
As a result of the recent nationwide increase in defaults on residential mortgages there has been concern 
expressed  in  the  financial  market  over  the  possible  impact  that  these  defaults  may  have  on 
redevelopment  agency  revenues in  general.    Reliable  information on  foreclosure  activity  is  difficult to 
find  and  what  information  that  is  available  is  not  readily  applicable  to discrete  areas  within  cities  and 
redevelopment project areas.  Much of the information available is segregated by county or ZIP code.   
 
The Project Area contained less than 3% of the total parcels within the City and less than 2% of the total 
residential parcels within the City.  Based on this information it seems unlikely that foreclosures within 
the  Project  Area  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  Redevelopment  Projects  assessed  values  and 
revenues. 
 

Trended Taxable Value Growth 

12 

Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency 
Fiscal Consultant’s Report 
February 19, 2009 
 
According to transfer of ownership reported by DataQuick, there have been 44 parcels within the Project 
Area that appear to have foreclosure activity.  Of the 44 parcels, 12 parcels have been sold resulting in 
$740,073 value reduction and 32 parcels are yet to be sold.  
 
HdL Coren & Cone make no representation that taxable values will actually grow at two percent.  Future 
values  will  also  be  affected  by  changes  of  ownership  and  new  construction  not  reflected  in  our 
projections.  In addition, the values of property previously reduced in value due to assessment appeals 
based on reduced market values could increase more than two percent when real estate values increase 
more than two percent (see Section IV A above).  Seismic activity and environmental conditions such as 
hazardous  substances  that  are  not  anticipated  in  this  report  might  also  impact  property  taxes  and  Tax 
Increment Revenue.  HdL Coren & Cone makes no representation that taxable values will actually grow 
at  the  rate  projected.    Anticipated  revenues  could  be  adjusted  as  a  result  of  unidentified  assessment 
appeal  refunds,  other  County  Assessor  corrections  discussed  previously,  or  unanticipated  increases  or 
decreases in property tax values.  Estimated valuations from developments included in this analysis are 
based  upon  our  understanding  of  the  general  practices  of  the  Kern  County  Assessor  and  Auditor-
Controller’s Office.  General assessment practices are subject to policy changes, legislative changes, and 
the  individual  appraiser's  judgment.    While  we  believe  our  estimates  to  be  reasonable,  taxable  values 
resulting from actual appraisals may vary from the amounts assumed in the projections.

Taxable values as reported by Kern County

(1)
(2) Real property consists of land and improvements.  Increased for transfer sales and decreased for estimated value loss due to foreclosure activity (see Table 4 - Old Town Project)

and increased  2% annually for inflation.
Personal property is held constant at 2008-09 value.
Projected Gross Tax Increment is based upon incremental taxable values factored against an assumed Project tax rate of 1.053307% declining to 1% over ten years.

(3)
(4)
(5) County Administration fee is estimated at 1.28% of Gross Revenue.
(6) Repayment of a loan from the US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development.
(7)

All Taxing Entities receive their shares of 25% of total tax increment revenue net of housing set aside.  In addition,
after year 10 Taxing Entities receive 21% of tax revenue on incremental value above the year 10 value net of housing
set aside.  Starting year 31 Taxing Entities receive 14% of tax revenue on incremental value above the year 30 net 
of housing set-aside. 

(8) Housing Set Aside calculated at 20% of Gross Revenue.

THE BAKERSFIELD REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY 

SOUTHEAST BAKERSFIELD PROJECT AREA 

 
 

PROJECTED TAXABLE VALUES AND 

ANTICIPATED TAX INCREMENT REVENUES 

February 19, 2009 

Introduction 

 
I. 
 
The  Bakersfield  Redevelopment  Agency  (the  Agency)  is  proposing  to  issue  two  series  of  bonds,  the  
Tax Allocation Bonds, Series  2009 B (Tax-Exempt – Tax Increment Revenue) and the Tax Allocation 
Bonds, Series 2009 C Bonds (Taxable – Tax Increment Revenue) (collectively, the Bonds).  The Bonds 
will be secured by a pledge of the tax increment revenues derived from the Southeast Bakersfield Project 
Area (the Project Area) referred to as the Project Area. 
 
The California Community Redevelopment  Law  (the Law) provides for the creation of redevelopment 
agencies  by  cities  and  counties  for  the  purpose  of  the  elimination  of  blight.    The  Law,  together  with 
Article 16, Section 16 of the California Constitution, authorizes redevelopment agencies to receive that 
portion of property tax revenue generated by project area taxable values that are in excess of the Base 
Year value.  The Base Year value is defined as the amount of the taxable values within the Project Area 
boundaries on the last equalized tax roll prior to adoption of the  Project  Area.   The amount of current 
year taxable value that  is in excess of the Base Year value is  referred to as incremental taxable value.  
Tax  revenues generated from the incremental taxable value are generally  referred to as Tax Increment 
Revenues.  The Law provides that  the Tax Increment  Revenues may be pledged by the Agency to the 
repayment of Agency indebtedness. 
 
In this report, Tax Increment Revenues, including Unitary Tax Revenue (see Section IV.H, Allocation of 
State  Assessed  Unitary  Taxes)  are  referred  to  as  Gross  Revenues.    Gross  Revenues  less:  SB  2557 
County Administrative charges (see Section IV.G, County Collection Charges); the Housing Set-Aside 
Requirement  (see  Section  V,  Low  and  Moderate  Income  Housing  Set-Aside);  tax  sharing  and  any 
applicable  owner  participation  agreement  payments  (see  Section  VII,  Tax  Sharing  Agreements  and 
Other Obligations); and other obligations with a lien on revenue superior to debt service on the bonds; 
are referred to as Tax Revenues. 
 
The  purpose  of  this  Fiscal  Consultant’s  Report  (the  Report)  is  to  examine  the  current  fiscal  year  and 
project for subsequent fiscal years the amount of Tax Revenues to be received by the Agency from the 
Project  Area.    As  a  result  of  our  research,  we  project  the  Tax  Revenues  for  the  Project  Area  to  be  as 
shown in the table below (000’s omitted):

The Project Area 

 
These projections are based on assumptions determined by our review of the taxable value history of the 
Project  Area  and  the  property  tax  assessment  and  property  tax  apportionment  procedures  of  Kern 
County  (the  County).    Future  year  assessed  values  and  Tax  Revenues  are  projections  based  upon  the 
assumptions described in this Report, and are not guaranteed as to accuracy and this Report is not to be 
construed as a representation of such by HdL Coren & Cone. 
 
 
II. 
 
The Project Area, encompassing 4,577 acres of land in east Bakersfield, was  established by Ordinance 
No. 3905 adopted on June 30, 1999.   
 
 
 
Table II illustrate the breakdown of land use in the Project Area by assessed value and are based on the 
lien  date  tax  roll  for  fiscal  year  2008-09.   Unsecured  parcels  and  Secured  Non-Unitary  Utilities  are 
shown  in  brackets  because  they  are,  in  reality,  tax  bills  that  are  assigned  to  secured  parcels  already 
accounted for in other categories.

B.  Redevelopment Plan Limits 

 
 
 
 
The Project Area was adopted under the provisions of the Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1290 in 1993.  
Under the Law, as amended, project areas adopted after January 1, 1994 terminate their effectiveness not 
more than 30 years from the date of their adoption.  Loans, advances and other forms of indebtedness 
may  not  be  repaid  beyond  45  years  following  the  date  of  adoption  of  the  redevelopment  plan.  
Redevelopment plans adopted after January 1, 1994 are not required to have limits on the amount of tax 
increment that may be received annually or over the life of the plan.  The Plans do contain limits on the 
maximum amount of debt to be repaid with tax increment that may be outstanding at one time.  The plan 
limitations for the Project Area are summarized below.

Taxable  values  are  prepared  and  reported  by  the  County  Auditor-Controller  each  fiscal  year  and 
represent  the  aggregation  of  all  locally  assessed  properties,  which  are  part  of  the  Project  Area.    The 
assessments  are  assigned  to  respective  Tax  Rate  Areas  (each,  a  TRA)  that  are  coterminous  to  the 
boundaries of the Project Area.  The historic reported taxable values for the Project Area were reviewed

B.  Top Ten Taxable Property Owners

Fiscal Consultant’s Report 
February 19, 2009 
 
in  order  to  ascertain  the  rate  of  taxable  property  valuation  growth  over  the  current  year  and  the  most 
recent six fiscal years beginning with 2003-04 (see Table 3). 
 
Growth in assessed value of the Project Area from the 1998-99 base year, as revised in 2007-08 to 2008-
09 was $455,776,707 (123.30%).  Between 2003-04 and 2008-09, the Southwest Project assessed values 
increased by $372,958,811 (82.43%).  This growth has been led by additions to secured values.  From 
2003-04  through  2008-09  secured  values  have  increased  by  $356,334,360  (85.73%).   Growth  of  the 
secured values was primarily due to new residential, commercial and industrial development.  With the 
exception  of  2004-05,  unsecured  value  have  increased  in  every  year  from  2003-04  through  2008-09.  
From 2004-05 to 2008-09, unsecured values have increased by $16,624,451 (45.14%). 
 
Spurred by falling home prices, approximately 40,000 homes sold in Kern County between July 1, 2005 
and  June  30,  2007  were  examined  by  the  Assessor  for  Proposition  8  adjustments.    According  to  the 
Assessor, approximately 40,000 homes have experienced adjustments downwards in their assessed value 
to  more  accurately  reflect  the  market  level,  resulting  in  approximately  $2.7  billion  value  reduction 
County-wide.    The  County  Assessor  is  continuing  to  follow  the  housing  market  and,  at  this  time, 
recognizes  there  could  be  additional  homes  experiencing  adjustments  for  the  lien  date  of  January  1, 
2009.  
 
 
 
A  review  of  the  top  ten  taxpayers  in  the  Project  Area  for  fiscal  year  2008-09  was  conducted.    The 
aggregate total taxable value for the ten largest taxpayers totaled $110,021,726.  This amount is 13.31% 
percent  of  the  total  assessed  value  and  24.14%  of  the  increment  value  of  the  Project  Area.    The  top 
taxpayer in the Project Area is an office building owned by Nakanogumi Corp SBD Group Inc., on two 
secured parcels with a value of $28,835,758.  The value of the Nakanogumi parcels is 3.49% of the total 
assessed value and 6.33% of the Project Area’s incremental value.  Details on the top ten taxpayers are 
contained on the attached Table 5. 
 
IV. 
 
 
 
The  taxable  values  of  secured  and  unsecured  property  are  established  each  year  on  the  January  1 
property  tax  lien  date.    The  values  established  on  the  lien  date  are  the  values  to  be  enrolled  for  the 
coming fiscal year.  Real Property reflects the reported assessed values for secured and unsecured land 
and  improvements.    Pursuant  to  Article  XIIIA  of  the  State  Constitution,  the  value  of  locally  assessed 
Real Property may only be increased up to two percent annually to reflect inflation.  In most cases Real 
Property  values  are  permitted  to  increase  to  full,  current  market  value  as  a  result  of  a  change  of 
ownership or new construction.  Utility properties assessed by the State Board of Equalization may be 
revalued annually and such assessments are not subject to the inflation limitations of Article XIIIA.  The 
taxable  value of Personal  Property  is  also  established on the  lien date  and is  not  subject  to the  annual 
two percent limit of locally assessed Real Property. 
 
Secured property includes property on which any property tax levied by a county becomes a lien on that 
property.  Unsecured property typically includes value for tenant improvements, fixtures, inventory  and

personal  property.    A  tax  levied  on  unsecured  property  does  not  become  a  lien  against  the  taxed 
unsecured  property,  but  may  become  a  lien  on  certain  other  secured  property  owned  by  the  taxpayer.  
The taxes levied on unsecured property are levied at the previous year's secured property tax rate. 
 
 
 
Chapter  498  of  the  Statutes  of  1983  provides  for  the  reassessment  of  property  upon  a  change  of 
ownership  or  completion  of  new  construction.    Such  reassessment  is  referred  to  as  the  Supplemental 
Assessment.    It  is  determined  by  applying  the  current  year's  tax  rate  to  the  amount  of  increase  in  a 
property's value and prorating the resulting property taxes to reflect the portion of the tax year remaining 
as determined by the date of the change in ownership or completion of new construction.  Supplemental 
Assessments become a lien against Real Property.  Since 1984-85, revenues derived from Supplemental 
Assessments have been allocated to redevelopment agencies and taxing entities in the same manner as 
regularly  collected  property  taxes.    The  receipt  of  Supplemental  Tax  Revenues  by  taxing  entities 
typically follows the change of ownership by a year or more.  In the Project Area the Agency received 
supplemental  revenues  totaling  $713,412  and  $563,113  for  fiscal  years  2006-07  and  2007-08, 
respectively.  We have not included projected amounts of revenue that could result from Supplemental 
Assessments in our projections. 
 
 
 
The  Project  Area  is  comprised of  a  total  of  37  Tax  Rate  Areas  (TRAs).    A  TRA  is  a  geographic area 
within which the taxes on all property are levied by a certain set of taxing entities.  These taxing entities 
each receive a prorated share of the general levy and those taxing entities with voter-approved over-ride 
tax rates receive the revenue resulting from that tax rate. 
 
Tax rates will vary from area to area within the State, as well as within a community and a project area.  
The  tax  rate  for  any  particular  parcel  is  based  upon  the  jurisdictions  levying  the  tax  rate  for  the  area 
where the parcel is located.  The tax rate consists of the general levy rate of $1.00 per $100 of taxable 
values  and  the  over-ride  tax  rate.    The  over-ride  rate  is  that  portion  of  the  tax  rate  which  exceeds  the 
general  levy  tax  rate  and  is  levied  to  pay  voter-approved  indebtedness  or  contractual  obligations  that 
existed prior to the enactment of Proposition XIII. 
 
A  Constitutional  amendment  approved  in  June  1983  allows  the  levy  of  over-ride  tax  rates  to  repay 
indebtedness for the acquisition and improvement of real property, upon approval by a two-thirds vote 
of the electorate.  A subsequent amendment of the Constitution prohibits the allocation to redevelopment 
agencies of tax revenues derived from over-ride tax rates levied for repayment of indebtedness approved 
by the voters after December 31, 1988.  The over-ride tax rates typically decline each year as a result of 
(1) increasing property values (which would reduce the over-ride rate that must be levied to meet debt 
service) and (2) the eventual retirement of debt over time.  For all of the Project Area TRAs, pre-1989 
over-ride  tax  rates  include  debt  levied  for  the  Kern  County  Water  Agency  of  0.049469  per  $100  of 
assessed value.  All the TRAs also contain over-ride service debt rates for various school districts that 
were  approved  after  1988  and  do  not  contribute  revenue  to  the  Agency.    The  tax  rate  on  unsecured 
property value in the current year is the secured tax rate from the prior year.  The secured tax increment 
projections are based on the published tax rates for 2008-09.

February 19, 2009 
 
Within  the  various  TRAs  within  the  Project  Area,  there  is  only  one  applicable  secured  tax  rate 
applicable to the Project Area tax increment, as illustrated by Table III below.  For the purposes of the 
projections, the tax rate of 1.049469% declines to 1% over ten years.

D.  Allocation of Taxes 

 
 
 
Secured  taxes  are  due  in  two  equal  installments.    Installments  of  taxes  levied  upon  secured  property 
become delinquent on December 10 and April 10.  Taxes on unsecured property are due  August 1 and 
become delinquent August 31.  The County disburses tax increment revenue to redevelopment agencies 
in monthly payments made August through July, with approximately 50 percent of annual revenue paid 
by December.  The Agency does not participate in a Teeter Plan.  The County bases its remittances on 
collections. 
 
 
 
A  review  was  made  of  the  receivable  and  allocated  tax  revenues  for  the  Project  Area  for  fiscal  years 
2003-04 through 2007-08.  Table IV below shows the collection rates for the Project Area during these 
fiscal  years.  Collection rates are a comparison of  annual revenues apportioned to a project area to the 
amount  collected for the apportionment  year.   Revenues collected in July accrue to the previous fiscal 
year.  A collection rate of over 100 percent reflects the fact that roll changes occurred after the lien date 
that increased assessed values and resulted in a greater amount of revenue.  Amounts under the heading 
Prior Year Collections include supplemental revenues and redemption payments and do not include July 
payments.

F.  Assessment Appeals 

 
Assessment appeals granted under Section 51 of the Revenue and Taxation Code (also known as Prop 8 
Appeals) require that, for each subsequent lien date, the value of real property shall be adjusted to be the 
lesser  of  its  base  year  value  as  adjusted  by  the  inflation  factor  pursuant  to  Article  XIIIA  of  the  State 
Constitution  or  its  full  cash  value  taking  into  account  reductions  in  value  due  to  damage,  destruction, 

6 

Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency 
Fiscal Consultant’s Report 
February 19, 2009 
 
depreciation, obsolescence, removal of property or other factors causing a decline in value.  Significant 
reductions to residential assessed values have occurred in most counties due to adjustments to residential 
market  value.    Most  of  these  reductions  in  value  have  affected  residential  properties  that  were  sold 
during  the  2004  through  2007.    Reductions  made  under  this  code  section  may  be  initiated  by  the 
Assessor  or  requested  by  the  property  owner.    After  a  roll  reduction  is  granted  under  Section  51,  the 
property is reviewed on an annual basis to determine the full cash value of the property and the valuation 
is adjusted accordingly.  This may result in further reductions or in value increases.  Such increases shall 
be consistent with the full cash value of the property and, as a result, may exceed the maximum annual 
inflationary growth rate allowed on other properties under Article XIIIA of the State Constitution.  Once 
the  property  has  regained  its  prior  value,  adjusted  for  inflation  it,  once  again,  is  subject  to  the  annual 
inflationary  factor  growth  rate  allowed  under  Article  XIIIA.    (See  Section  X).   The  Assessor  has 
reviewed  the  values  of  40,000  residential  parcels  within  the  County  that  were  purchased  between 
January 2004 and December 2007.  This has resulted in Prop 8 reductions totaling $2.9 billion for 2008-
09.  The impact of these actions on the Project Area is relatively small but recovery of these value losses 
may occur over a number of years.  
 
Assessment  appeals  may  also  be  requested  as  adjustments  to  a property’s  base  year  value.    If  such  an 
appeal is granted with a change in value, the base year value of the property is adjusted accordingly and 
that  value  is  subsequently  adjusted  for  new  construction,  demolition  and  any  other  changes  requiring 
revaluation  of  the  parcel’s  land,  improvement  and  personal  property  values  and  by  the  annual 
inflationary factor growth rate allowed under Article XIIIA. 
 
There  are  no  outstanding  assessment  appeals  by  any  of  the  top  ten  taxpayers  within  the  Project  Area.  
There is one pending appeal in the Project Area, filed by property owners that are not among the top ten 
taxpayers.   
 
 
 
Chapter 466 of the Statutes of 1990 allows counties to recover charges for property tax administration in 
an amount equal to their 1989-90 property tax administration costs, as adjusted annually.  The County 
collection charges for 2007-08 were $55,421 for the Project Area.  For purposes of our projections, we 
have  assumed  that  the  County  will  continue  to  charge  the  Agency  for  property  tax  administration  and 
that such charge will annually equate to 1.28% of the Project Area’s Gross Revenue for the remainder of 
the Projections (see Tables 1 and 2).   
 
 
 
Legislation enacted in 1986 (Chapter 1457) and 1987 (Chapter 921) provided for a modification of the 
distribution  of  tax  revenue  derived  from  unitary  property  owned  by  utilities  (except  railroads)  and 
assessed by the State Board of Equalization (SBE).  Unitary property is property owned by a utility and 
used in the operating function of the utility.  Non-unitary property is property owned by a utility and not 
used  in  the  functioning  of  the  utility.    Non-unitary  property  appears  on  the  tax  rolls  as  secured  utility 
property. 
 
Prior to the 1988-89 fiscal year, property assessed by the SBE was assessed statewide and was allocated 
according to the location of individual components of a utility in a TRA.  Commencing in 1988-89, tax 
revenues derived from unitary property are accumulated in a single TRA for the county and distributed 
to each taxing entity in the county in the following manner: (1) each taxing entity will receive the same 
amount  as  in  the  previous  year  plus  an  increase  for  inflation  of  up  to  two  percent;  (2)  if  utility  tax

revenues are insufficient to provide the same amount as in the previous year, each taxing entity's share 
would  be  reduced  pro-rata  county  wide;  and  (3)  any  increase  in  revenue  above  two  percent  would  be 
allocated to all taxing jurisdictions in the county by a ratio determined by dividing each taxing entity's 
share of the county's total secured tax levies for the prior year by the total secured levy of the county, 
exclusive of debt service. 
 
For  fiscal  year  2008-09,  the  County  Auditor-Controller  will  allocate  $9,611  in  unitary  revenue  to  the 
Project Area.  We have assumed the Agency will annually receive the same amount in future years. 
 
 
V. 
 
Section 33334.6 of the Law requires redevelopment agencies to set aside 20 percent of all tax increment 
revenues from project areas adopted prior to January  1, 1977 into a low and moderate-income housing 
fund (the Housing Set-Aside Requirement).  An agency can reduce the Housing Set-Aside Requirement 
if it annually makes certain prescribed determinations that are consistent with the housing element of the 
general  plan.  These findings are:  (1) that no need exists in the community to improve or increase the 
supply of low and moderate-income housing; or, (2) some stated percentage less than 20 percent of the 
tax increment is sufficient to meet the housing need.  In order to make findings (1) or (2), the Agency's 
finding must be consistent with the housing element of the community's general plan, including its share 
of  the  regional  housing  needs  of  very  low-income  households  and  persons  and  families  of  low  or 
moderate  income.  No  such  findings  have  been  made  by  the  Agency  and,  thus,  20  percent  of  Gross 
Revenues have been projected as being set aside from the Project Area.  The Agency has been and will 
continue to set aside 20 percent of the Gross Revenues. 
 
 
VI. 
SB 211 was signed into law as Chapter 741, Statutes of 2001.  This legislation has two main impacts on 
the  limits  contained  in  an  agency’s  redevelopment  plan.    First,  a  city  council  may  eliminate  the  time 
limit  to  establish  indebtedness  in  redevelopment  project  areas  adopted  prior  to  January  1,  1994  by 
ordinance.    If  a  redevelopment  plan  is  so  amended,  any  existing  tax  sharing  agreements  will  continue 
and certain statutory tax sharing for entities without tax sharing agreements will commence in the year 
the eliminated limit would have taken effect.  Second, a city council may extend the time limit for plan 
effectiveness  and  repayment  of  debt  for  up  to  ten  years  if  it  can  make  certain  specified  findings.  
Because the Project Area was adopted after the effective date AB1290, the Project Area is not subject to 
the effects of SB211. 
 
In  order  to  address  State  Budget  deficits,  the  Legislature  enacted  SB  614,  SB  844  and  SB  1135  that 
required payments from redevelopment agencies for the 1992-93, 1993-94 and 1994-95 fiscal years into 
a countywide ERAF.  An agency could have used any funds legally available and not legally obligated 
for other uses, including reserve funds, bond proceeds, earned income, and proceeds of land sales, but 
not  moneys  in  the  Low  and  Moderate  Income  Housing  Fund  (the  Housing  Fund)  to  satisfy  this 
obligation.    An  agency  could  have  reduced  its  payment  due  to  existing  indebtedness,  contractual 
obligations  and  90  percent  of  1991-93  administrative  costs  (collectively,  Existing  Obligations).    If  an 
agency could not make the required payment due to Existing Obligations, it could have borrowed up to 
50 percent of its 1992-93 contribution to the Housing Fund (which must be repaid within ten years), or 

Legislation

the  agency  was  required  to  obtain  a  loan  from  the  city/county  in  order  to  pay  the  difference  between 
what the agency pays and the total amount due.  For agencies that did not borrow to meet any shortfall 
of the required payment, the county auditor-controller was required to deduct any amount due from the 
city/county's  allocation  of  property  taxes.    This  obligation  applied  to  the  agency  and  not  to  specific 
redevelopment  project  areas.    According  to  the  Agency,  it  has  no  outstanding  ERAF  obligations.    In 
addition to the payments from redevelopment agencies periodic State budget solutions have involved the 
shifting of property tax revenues from cities, counties and special districts to the ERAF. 
 
From 1994-95 to 2001-02 State Budgets were adopted with no additional shifting of tax increment from 
redevelopment  agencies;  however,  the  2002-03  State  Budget  required  a  shift  of  $75  million  of  tax 
increment statewide from redevelopment agencies to ERAF to meet the State budget shortfall.  AB 1768 
(Chapter 1127, Statutes of 2002) was enacted by the Legislature and signed by the Governor and based 
upon the methodology provided in the 2002-03 State Budget, the shift requirement for the Agency was 
$75,458  for  fiscal  year  2002-03  only.    The  Agency  made  the  required  payment  without  impacting  its 
payment of debt service and other obligations. 
 
As  part  of  the  State’s  2003-04  budget  legislation,  SB  1045  (Chapter  260,  Statutes  of  2003)  required 
redevelopment agencies statewide to contribute $135 million to local county ERAFs which reduced the 
amount  of  State  funding  for  schools.    This  transfer  of  funds  was  limited  to Fiscal  Year  2003-04 only.  
The amount of revenue that was transferred by the Agency to the Kern County ERAF for 2003-04 was 
$132,543.    The  Agency  made  this  payment  to  the  County  by  the  May  10,  2004  deadline  without 
impacting its payment of debt service on existing indebtedness. 
 
Under the Law, as amended by SB 1045, the Agency was authorized to use a simplified methodology to 
amend the individual  redevelopment  plans to extend by  one  year the effectiveness  of the plan and the 
time during which the Agency may repay debt with tax increment revenues.  In addition, the amount of 
this  payment  and  the  ERAF  payments  made  in  prior  years  may  be  deducted  from  the  amount  of  the 
Project Area cumulative tax increment revenues.  The Agency intends to extend the Plans in the future 
pursuant  to  SB  1045.  These  extensions  of  time  are  not  reflected  in  the  projections  and  in  the  Project 
Area limits shown in Section II B. 
 
After  the  State’s  budget  for  2004-05  was  approved  by  the  Legislature  and  signed  by  the  Governor, 
Senate  Bill  1096  was  adopted.    Pursuant  to  SB  1096,  redevelopment  agencies  within  the  State  paid  a 
combined  total of  $250  million  to ERAF  in  each  of  fiscal  years  2004-05 and 2005-06 using  the  same 
formula  as  was  used  for  2003-04.    Annual  payments  were  due  on  May  10  of  each  fiscal  year.    As  in 
previous  years,  payments  were  allowed  to  be  made  from  any  available  funds  other  than  the  Housing 
Fund.  If an agency  was unable to  make a payment,  it was allowed to borrow up to 50 percent  of the 
current  year  Housing  Set-Aside  Revenues,  however,  such  borrowed  amounts  must  be  repaid  to  the 
Housing Fund within 10 years of the last ERAF payment (May 10, 2006).  The Agency’s portion of the 
statewide ERAF requirement for 2004-05 was $248,051.  The Agency’s 2005-06 payment amount was 
$286,573.  The ERAF requirements were subordinate to the payment of debt service on existing bonds 
and the Agency made such payments on time. 
 
SB  1096  made  provision  for  extensions  of  project  area  effectiveness  of  one  year  for  each  of  the  two 
payments required.  For project areas that have less than 10 years of plan effectiveness remaining after 
June 30, 2005, a one year extension is authorized.  For project areas that have more than 10 years and 

9 

Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency 
Fiscal Consultant’s Report 
February 19, 2009 
 
less than 20 years of plan effectiveness remaining after June 30, 2005, a one year extension is authorized 
if  the  city  council  can  make  certain  findings  that  the  redevelopment  agency  is  in  compliance  with 
specified  state  housing  requirements.    These  requirements  are:  1)  that  the  redevelopment  agency  is 
setting aside 20 percent of gross tax increment revenue; 2) housing implementation plans are in place; 3) 
replacement  housing  and  inclusionary  housing  requirements  are  being  met;  and,  4)  no  excess  surplus 
exists.  For those project areas  with more than 20 years of plan effectiveness  remaining after June 30, 
2005 no extension of time is authorized. 
 
The  Legislature  has  now  enacted  AB  1389  to  require  a  $350  million  shift  for  2008-09  from 
redevelopment  agencies  to ERAF.    There  will  be  no  repayment  of  this  amount,  nor  any  extensions of 
redevelopment plan limits.  The Housing Set Aside Requirement will not apply to the amount paid for 
the ERAF.  The amount the Agency will be required to pay is $571,840.  The payment may come from 
any available Agency revenues. A redevelopment agency may borrow up to 50 percent from its current 
year Housing Set-Aside Requirement for purposes of making the ERAF payment.   The ERAF payment 
is  subordinate  to  all  bonded  debt  issued  by  a  redevelopment  agency.    A  redevelopment  agency  that 
cannot make the payment due to existing indebtedness may borrow from their legislative body.  Failure 
to  make  the  ERAF  payment  will  result  in  penalties  that  effectively  stop  new  activities  of  a 
redevelopment agency. 
 
The  Agency  cannot  predict  whether  the  State  Legislature  will  enact  any  other  legislation  requiring 
additional  or  increased  future  shifts  of  tax  increment  revenues  to  the  State  and/or  to  schools,  whether 
through an arrangement similar to ERAF or by other arrangements, and, if so, the effect on future Tax 
Revenues. 
 
Legislation, AB 1389, enacted with the 2008-09 State Budget requires redevelopment agencies to report 
their  statutory  payments  pursuant  to  AB  1290  and  SB  211  to  their  county  auditors.    Redevelopment 
agencies are to report to their county  auditors their Statutory Payments  by each project  area, and each 
taxing agency for each of past five years (2003-04 through 2007-08) by October 1, 2008, and annually 
by October 1st for the next six years.  This information is to be consolidated by the counties and reported 
to  the  State  Controller.    The  State  Controller  is  then  responsible  for  disseminating  the  appropriate 
information, including redevelopment agencies whose calculations are determined by the counties to not 
be in concurrence with the requirements of AB 1290, to the Legislative Analyst, the State Department of 
Finance,  the  State  Board  of  Education,  and  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  California  Community 
Colleges. 
 
In the event of a dispute the redevelopment agency has 15 days to revise and resubmit its report, submit 
a  statement  of  dispute  identifying  the  issues,  amend  the  report,  or  submit  the  report  to  the  State 
Controller  with  the  county’s  analysis.    The  legislation  allows  the  State  Controller  to  revoke  a  county 
finding  of  concurrence  and  direct  an  agency  to  resubmit  a  report  to  the  county  if  the  Controller  finds 
significant errors in the report.  When the State Controller submits its report to the Legislative Analyst 
and the Department of Finance it is required to summarize the statements of dispute including whether 
the Controller or other state entity has provided instructions as to how these disputes should be resolved.  
Ultimately, for agencies with unresolved disputes, the State Controller with the concurrence of the State 
Director of Finance, may waive the penalties and interest charges for late payments (see Penalties and 
Interest  below)  for  12  months  for  agencies  that  filed  a  statement  of  dispute  that,  in  the opinion of  the 
Controller, is likely to be resolved in a manner consistent with an agency’s position. 

10 

Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency 
Fiscal Consultant’s Report 
February 19, 2009 
 
 
After  February  1,  2009,  an  agency  listed  on  the  most  recent  State  Controller’s  report  for  which  the 
county  has  not  issued  a  finding  of  concurrence  or  that  has  outstanding  Statutory  payments  to  a  local 
educational agency, will be subject to penalties and interest charges.  The penalties, would prevent the 
agency  from  adding  new  project  areas  or  expanding  existing  areas,  issuing  new  bonds  or  other 
obligations including refunding, encumbering or expending any funds derived from any source except to 
pay  existing  loans,  contractual  obligations,  tax-sharing  agreements  or  housing  set-aside  deposits.  
Administrative  costs  would  be  limited  75  percent  of  the  average  monthly  amount  spent  on 
administration in the previous fiscal year. 
 
Such identified agencies would also incur interest costs on any Statutory Payment that is not paid by 60 
days after the close of the fiscal year in which the pass-through payment was required.  The interest rate 
would be 150 percent of the current Pooled Money Investment Account earnings annual yield beginning 
60 days after the close of the fiscal year for which the Statutory Payment was due.  The State Controller, 
with the concurrence of the State Director of Finance may waive the penalties and interest for up to 12 
months for agencies identified by as not in concurrence when a dispute by an agency that is likely to be 
sustained,  when  the  agency  has  paid  the  local  educational  agencies  or  had  the  county  withhold  a 
disputed amount, or if the agency would sustain a fiscal hardship if it made the payments in the amount 
estimated by the county auditor. 
 
Since  AB  1389  was  enacted  on  September  30th,  one  day  before  the  first  deadline,  it  is  taking 
redevelopment  agencies,  counties  and  the  State  Controller  longer  to  review  the  calculations  than 
specified in the legislation.  Kern County has concurred with the Agency’s calculations. 
 
 
VII.  Tax Sharing Agreements and Other Obligations 
 
A. 
The Project Area was adopted after January 1, 1994 and is, therefore, subject to the statutory tax sharing 
payments mandated in the Law as amended by Assembly Bill 1290.  These tax-sharing payments are set 
by statute and are not negotiated.  A prescribed portion of the Agency’s tax increment revenue must be 
shared with all taxing entities within the Project Area.  This defined tax-sharing amount has three tiers.  
The  first  tier  began  with  the  first  year  that  the  Project  Area  received  tax  increment  revenue  and 
continues  for  the  life  of  the  Project  Area.    This  first  tier  tax-sharing  amount  is  25  percent  of  the 
Agency’s  gross  tax  increment  revenue  net  of  the  Housing  Set-Aside  Requirement.    The  City  of 
Bakersfield may elect to receive its share of this first tier of tax-sharing payments.  If the City does not 
elect to receive its share, that amount of the tax sharing payment will remain with the Agency.   
 
The second tier begins in the eleventh year after the Agency first receives tax increment revenue.  This 
second tier is 21 percent of the tax increment revenue, net of the Housing Set-Aside Requirement, that is 
derived from the growth in assessed value that is in excess of the assessed value of the project area in 
year ten.  The City may not receive a share of the second tier tax-sharing payments. 
 
The third tier begins in the 31st year after the Agency first receives tax increment revenue.  This third 
tier is 14 percent of the tax increment revenue, net of the Housing Set-Aside Requirement that is derived 
from the growth in assessed value that is in excess of the assessed value of the Project Area in the 30th

year.  The City may not receive a share of the third tier tax-sharing payments.  These three tiers of tax 
sharing are calculated independent of one another and continue from their inception through the life of 
the Project Area. 
 
B. 
The Agency has committed tax increment funds to the repayment of loans from the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD).   The Agency contracted for loan guarantee assistance under 
Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development  Act of 1974 to finance activities in the Old 
Town Project connection with a mixed-use project.  From the Project Area, to help finance a fire station 
the Agency has incurred a $1,600,000 Section 108 HUD loan to be paid over 20 years.  To help finance 
the Mill Creek South Mixed Use Project in the Project Area, the Agency entered into another agreement 
with HUD to repay $3,750,000 over a 20 year term.  This loan is established at a variable interest rate 
which  may  be  converted  to  a  fixed  at  the  first  year.    We  have  assumed  a  5.5%  annual  interest  for 
repayment of the loan. 
 
 
VIII.  New Development 
A review of recent transfers of ownership has been conducted and a number of transfers were found to 
have  occurred  after  the  January  1,  2008  lien  date  for  the  current  fiscal  year.    These  transfers  of 
ownership  occurred  from  January  1,  2008  through  August  15,  2008.    As  a  result,  the  sales  values  on 
these transfers of ownership are expected to be reflected in the tax rolls for 2009-10. 
 
Within the Project Area, 110 transfers of ownership were  found.   Of the 110 transfers, 57 are sales of 
foreclosed  properties  and  two  are  sales  to  tax-exempt  entities.    These  transfers  of  ownership  are 
expected  to  add  $331,206  in  new  value  to  the  2009-10  tax  roll  for  the  Project  Area.    Based  on  data 
provided by DataQuick, there are 158 parcels in foreclosure with outstanding mortgages that may result 
in  a  reduction  of  $11,326,855.    The  impacts  of  these  transfers  are  included  in  the  Projections  of 
Incremental  Taxable  Value  and  Tax  Increment  Revenue  and  shown  in  detail  on  Table  4  (New 
Development). 
 
 
IX. 
 
Growth in real property land and improvement values have been limited to an assumed rate of growth of 
real  property  taxable  values  of  two  percent  annually  as  allowed  under  Article  XIIIA  of  the  State 
Constitution.    A  two  percent  growth  rate  has  been  assumed  because  it  is  the  maximum  inflationary 
growth rate permitted by law and this rate of growth has been achieved in all but five years since 1981.  
The years in which less than two percent growth was realized were 1983-84 (1.0%), 1995-96 (1.19%), 
1996-97  (1.11%),  1999-00  (1.85%)  and  2004-05  (1.867%).    If  in  future  years  the  growth  of  taxable 
value  in  the  project  area  is  less  than  two  percent,  the  resultant  Tax  Increment  Revenues  would  be 
reduced. 
 
As a result of the recent nationwide increase in defaults on residential mortgages there has been concern 
expressed  in  the  financial  market  over  the  possible  impact  that  these  defaults  may  have  on 
redevelopment  agency  revenues in  general.    Reliable  information on  foreclosure  activity  is  difficult to

February 19, 2009 
 
find  and  what  information  that  is  available  is  not  readily  applicable  to discrete  areas  within  cities  and 
redevelopment project areas.  Much of the information available is segregated by county or ZIP code.   
 
The Project Area contained less than 7% of the total parcels within the City and less than 6% of the total 
residential parcels within the City.  Based on this information it seems unlikely that foreclosures within 
the Project Area will have a significant impact on the Project Area’s assessed values and revenues. 
 
According  to  transfer  of  ownership  reported  by  DataQuick,  there  have  been  259  parcels  within  the 
Project  Area  that  appear  to  have  foreclosure  activity.    Of  the  215  parcels,  57  parcels  have  been  sold 
resulting in $3,199,583 value reduction and 158 parcels are yet to be sold.  
 
HdL Coren & Cone make no representation that taxable values will actually grow at two percent.  Future 
values  will  also  be  affected  by  changes  of  ownership  and  new  construction  not  reflected  in  our 
projections.  In addition, the values of property previously reduced in value due to assessment appeals 
based on reduced market values could increase more than two percent when real estate values increase 
more than two percent (see Section IV A above).  Seismic activity and environmental conditions such as 
hazardous  substances  that  are  not  anticipated  in  this  report  might  also  impact  property  taxes  and  Tax 
Increment Revenue.  HdL Coren & Cone makes no representation that taxable values will actually grow 
at  the  rate  projected.    Anticipated  revenues  could  be  adjusted  as  a  result  of  unidentified  assessment 
appeal  refunds,  other  County  Assessor  corrections  discussed  previously,  or  unanticipated  increases  or 
decreases in property tax values.  Estimated valuations from developments included in this analysis are 
based  upon  our  understanding  of  the  general  practices  of  the  Kern  County  Assessor  and  Auditor-
Controller’s Office.  General assessment practices are subject to policy changes, legislative changes, and 
the  individual  appraiser's  judgment.    While  we  believe  our  estimates  to  be  reasonable,  taxable  values 
resulting from actual appraisals may vary from the amounts assumed in the projections.

Taxable values as reported by Kern County

Personal property is held constant at 2008-09 value.
Projected Gross Tax Increment is based upon incremental taxable values factored against an assumed Project tax rate of 1.053307% declining to 1% over ten years.

(1)
(2) Real property consists of land and improvements.  Increased for transfer sales and decreased for estimated value loss due to foreclosure activity (see Table 4 - Southeast Project) and increased  2% annually for inflation.
(3)
(4)
(5) County Administration fee is estimated at 1.28% of Gross Revenue.
(6) HUD loan of $1,600,000 to be paid over 20 years.
(7)
(8)

The Agency is committed to repay a $3,750,000 HUD loan over 20 years.
All Taxing Entities receive their shares of 25% of total tax increment revenue net of housing set aside.  In addition,
after year 10 Taxing Entities receive 21% of tax revenue on incremental value above the year 10 value net of housing
set aside.  Starting year 31 Taxing Entities receive 14% of tax revenue on incremental value above the year 30 net 
of housing set-aside. 

(9) Housing Set Aside calculated at 20% of Gross Revenue.

Members of the Agency and Executive Director 
Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency 
 
 
The  Component  Unit  Financial  Report  of the  Bakersfield  Redevelopment  Agency  (Agency) for 
the  fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2008,  is  submitted  herewith.    This  report  was  prepared  by  the 
City's Finance Department.  Responsibility for both the accuracy of the presented data and the 
completeness  and  fairness  of  the  presentation,  including  all  disclosures,  rests  with  this 
department.    We  believe  the  data,  as  presented,  is  accurate  in  all  material  aspects;  that  it  is 
presented in a manner designed to fairly set forth the financial position and results of operations 
of the Agency as measured by the financial activity of its various funds; and that all disclosures 
necessary  to  enable  the  reader  to  gain  the  maximum  understanding  of  the  Agency's  financial 
affairs have been included. 
 
 
Accounting System 
 
In  developing  and  evaluating  the  Agency's  accounting  system,  consideration  is  given  to  the 
adequacy in internal accounting controls.  Internal accounting controls are designed to provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding: (1) the safeguarding of assets against loss 
from  unauthorized  use  or  disposition;  and  (2)  the  reliability  of  financial  records  for  preparing 
financial  statements  and  maintaining  accountability  for  assets.    The  concept  of  reasonable 
assurance recognized that: (1) the cost of the control should not exceed the benefits likely to be 
derived;  and  (2)  the  evaluation  of  costs  and  benefits  requires  estimates  and  judgments  by 
management. 
 
All internal control evaluations occur within the above framework.  We believe that the Agency's 
internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of 
proper recording of financial transactions. 
 
 
The Reporting Entity 
 
This Agency of the City of Bakersfield was created pursuant to the Community Redevelopment 
Law (Section 33000 of the Health and Safety Code of the State of California) and was activated 
by Ordinance No. 1709 of the City Council on December 18, 1967.

Three Project Areas 
 
The Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency is made up of three separate project areas: 
 
 
 
 
 
State assessed unitary and operating non-unitary values are provided County-wide only and are 
not available by the tax base area for any of the project areas.  Assessed valuations are stated 
at 100% of taxable value for property within each project area for 2007-08.   
 
The  Southeast  Bakersfield  Project  Area,  encompassing  4,619  acres  of  land  in  southeast 
Bakersfield,  was  established  with  the  adoption  of  the  Redevelopment  Plan  for  the  project  by 
Ordinance No. 3905 on June 30, 1999.  The 4,619 acres are the basis for the Redevelopment 
Tax  increment  value.    Assessed  valuations  in  the  Redevelopment  area  were  frozen  upon 
becoming a part of the Project.  Assessed valuations are as follows:

The  Downtown  Redevelopment  Project  Area,  encompassing  16  square  blocks  in  the  central 
business district, was established with the adoption of the Redevelopment Plan for the project 
ordinance No. 2033 on August 14, 1972.  Subsequently, it was amended three times as follows: 
 

November  25,  1974  to  include  33  additional  blocks;  August  30,  1976  to  include  9 
additional  blocks;  and  December  12,  1979  with  the  addition  of  17  blocks.    These  75 
blocks  which  cover  approximately  225  acres,  are  the  basis for the  Redevelopment  Tax 
increment  value.    Assessed  valuations  in  the  Redevelopment  area  were  frozen  upon

2007-08 Redevelopment  Financial Highlights   
 
The Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency oversees three project areas which include Downtown 
Bakersfield  (DB),  Old  Town  Kern  –  Pioneer  (OTK-P),  and  Southeast  Bakersfield  (SE).    After 
each project description the project area is indicated, as noted above.       
 
The Parkview Cottages – Single Family Housing Project (OTK-P)  
The City was awarded a $1.2 million HELP loan, which was used to acquire a portion of the old 
foundry  site  located  at  21st  and  “R”  streets.    The  project  consists  of  74  single-family  housing 
units,  ranging  from  1,280  to  1,820  square  feet.    Each  unit  will  be  two  stories  and  have  a 
two/three car garage.  One home is in escrow, thirteen homes are ready for sale, home buyers 
currently occupy 29 units, and two units are models. 
 
Current market conditions and lack of mortgage financing options for low and moderate-income 
families  have  affected  the  ability  to  sale  the  homes.    Staff  is  currently  working  with  the 
developer, the real estate agent, and various mortgage companies to seek additional marketing 
venues and lending opportunities for the project. 
 
Baker Street - Old Town Kern Mixed Use Project                   
Foundation  work  and  grading  has  been  completed  for  Phase  I  of  the  project  located  east  of 
Baker Street, south of Lake Street on one-half block.  When finished, this phase, will include 24 
three-story  town  homes,  13  residential  lofts  and  9,000  square  feet  of  commercial  space  on 
Baker  Street.    The  residential  and  commercial  development  are  for-sale  units.    Neighborhood 
type services are anticipated for the commercial space.  Phase I should be completed by Spring 
2009.    The  next  three  phases  will  include  more  residential  and  commercial  units,  and  41,000 
square feet  of  new  commercial  space  such  as  a  grocery  store  and  pharmacy  as  possible  key 
anchors.  Total project value is approximately $35 million.

South Mill Creek  -  Retail, Entertainment & Housing Project (SE)          
The  Mill  Creek  South  Mixed-Use  Project  is  a  commercial  and  residential  plan  that  will  be 
approximately 10 acres and include a minimum of 80 units of affordable town home style high 
rise rental units, 35 market rate urban style upscale condominiums, and 65,000 square feet of 
commercial  space  for  retail,  restaurants,  community  events,  and  neighborhood  services.  The 
proposed  project  is  located  in  the  Southeast  Redevelopment  Project  Area,  alongside  the 
southern tip of Mill Creek. The restaurants in the planned retail development will have outdoor 
patio  seating  overlooking  Mill  Creek,  a  1.5-mile  stretch  of  agriculture  canal  which  is  being 
redeveloped into a major recreational amenity with a white water look and will travel through the 
heart of downtown Bakersfield.  The planned $60 million, 10 acre mixed-use project will replace 
a  contaminated  metal  recycling  business  and  auto  repair  and  body  shop.  In  addition,  it  will 
replace  a  dilapidated  empty  warehouse  and  a  predominantly  vacant  commercial  dilapidated 
building with several abandoned partial structures. 
 
Environmental  studies  for  traffic,  noise,  air  quality,  and  a  phase  II  environmental  site 
assessment  were  completed  in  May  2007.    An Environmental  Assessment  on the  project  was 
prepared on June 1, 2007, and issued to responsible agencies for public review and comment 
until  June  25,  2007.    The  Notice  of  No  Significant  Impact  and  Notice  of  Intent  to  Request 
Release  of  Funds  have  been  processed.    In  September  2007  the  Bakersfield  Redevelopment 
Agency  (Agency)  received  a  $3,750,000  Section  108  Loan  and  a  $750,000  Brownfield 
Economic  Development  Initiative  Grant  to  assist  with  land  acquisition.  In  addition,  the  Agency 
received  a  $1,000,000  CalHFA  Residential  Development  Loan  for  property  acquisition  and 
$2,000,000 for construction costs.  The CalHFA loan is at 3% simple interest and is to be repaid 
in 5 years.  
 
In  January  of  2008,  two  firms;  Chelsea  Investments  and  Southwest  Consulting  Inc.,  were 
selected by the Redevelopment Agency for the development.  Exclusive negotiating agreements 
were approved as Chelsea was selected for the development of 70 affordable rental units and 
Southwest Consulting, Inc., for the development of 44 condos, 69 family rental units and 97,400 
square  feet  of  commercial  space.    The  negotiations  are  underway,  with  Development 
Agreements  drafted 
the 
Redevelopment Agency in June 2008. 
 
The residential component of South Mill Creek is anticipated to begin construction by January 
2009,  with  completion  expected  by  December  2009.    The  commercial  construction  will  be 
concurrent with the residential timeline. 
 
Mill  Creek Linear Park - (OTK & SE)                    
Mill  Creek  is  a  conceptual  design  of  a  1.5  mile  stretch  of  agricultural  canal  which  is  being 
redeveloped into a major recreational linear park with a white water look and will travel through 
the heart of downtown Bakersfield along the Kern Island Canal from Golden State to California 
Avenues.  Elements  of  the  project  include  a  walking  path,  public  art,  street  furniture,  lighting, 
decorative fencing, landscaping, creation of a pond in Central Park, and a new pedestrian plaza 
at  the  17th  Street  and  “R”  Street  intersection,  creating  a  “River  Street”  environment.    The 
Redevelopment  Agency  received  a  $10  million  California  Infrastructure  Bank  loan  to  provide 
financing for the project.  Total budget for the project to date is $12.7 million.

A multi-disciplinary team was assembled to design the Mill Creek Linear Park Master Plan, with 
estimated completion of the design and construction of improvements to Central Park in spring 
2008.  Construction of elevated street crossings at 19th and 21st Streets and Phase 2, 4,5A & 5B 
of the parkway are planned for FY 08/09.  
 
 Staff will seek additional state and federal grant resources to help fully fund construction of the 
project. 
 
Southeast Neighborhood Revitalization Project – (SE)                        
Staff has developed a three-year comprehensive targeted neighborhood revitalization program.  
This program includes the addition of one dedicated Code Enforcement position, partial clerical 
support,  equipment  and  supplies  to  provide  various  code  enforcement  activities  such  as 
removal of junk cars and the demolition of substandard structures.  The program focuses on a 
five block area bounded by Brook Street to the south, Hale Street to the east, E. Planz Road to 
the  north  and  Cottonwood  Road  to  the  west.    The  area  is  a  blighted  tract  with  110  structures 
consisting  of  wood  frame,  new  and  older  mobile  home  units  (28),  and  deficient  wood  frame 
single  family  homes.    Thirty  eight  (38)  vacant  lots  are  scattered  throughout  the  neighborhood 
with  various  amounts  of  debris,  abandoned  vehicles  and  substandard  structures.    Addressing 
deficient commercial structures along Cottonwood Road is not included in the plan at this time. 
 
Additional  housing  programs  are  currently  under  development  for  low  income  residents  not 
exceeding 120% of the area median income that will include a targeted owner-occupied housing 
rehabilitation loan program up to $40,000 per unit.  The assistance will  be in the form of a no 
interest deferred loan for 15 years.  In addition, qualifying homeowners occupying substandard 
homes  with  clear  title  to  their  property  may  be  eligible  for  down  payment  assistance  up  to 
$50,000 to purchase or construct a new home on their existing lot or purchase a manufactured 
home.  Loan terms will be based on standard down payment assistance requirements.  A front 
porch grant program is also available to improve the appearance of the exterior of a residence.  
The  maximum  project  cost  cannot  exceed  $5,000.    This  program  requires  a  matching 
contribution of 10% of the total project cost from the applicant.  This program was funded with 
Southeast Tax Increment funds. 
 
Approximately twenty five residents attended a community meeting on Saturday, June 21, 2008 
at the New First Community Baptist Church on East Planz Road to learn about the Filson Area 
Targeted Neighborhood Revitalization Housing Programs.  Since the community meeting, staff 
has received approval from the Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency to implement a sewer grant 
not to exceed $10,000 and a demolition grant not to exceed $8,000.  These funds will provide 
additional assistance to property owners whose incomes do not exceed 80% of AMI with costs 
associated  with  replacing  a  substandard  structure.    One  applicant  to  date  has  been  pre-
approved  for  a  loan  with  Bank  of  America  and  down  payment  assistance  through  the  Filson 
Area Targeted Revitalization program to purchase a manufactured home. 
 
 Habitat for Humanity                                      
On  May  5,  2008,  the  Bakersfield  Redevelopment  Agency  approved  an  agreement  to  sell  a 
vacant  parcel  located  at  1812  Filson  Street  to  Habitat.    This  parcel  was  purchased  by  the 
Agency  through  a  tax  default  sale.    Habitat  for  Humanity  volunteers  and  the  prospective  new 
homeowner  will  begin  construction  on  the  home  in  September.    The  home  will  be  built  during 
and  at the  Kern  County  Fair.   The  completed  home  will  then  be  relocated  to the  Filson  Street 
address.    This  parcel  is  also  located  within  the  5-block  Southeast  Targeted  Neighborhood 
program area.

Habitat for Humanity intends to acquire the 8759 ± sq. ft. lot held by the Agency through its Low-
and-Moderate Income Housing Fund. They will develop the housing unit through its homeowner 
sweat  equity  program.  It  will  consist  of  a  three  bedroom  1,100  square  foot  single-family 
residence which will be sold to a qualified person or family whose income does not exceed low 
or  moderate  Income.  Habitat  will  have  eighteen  months  from  the  date  of  the  Purchase 
Agreement  to  complete  the  housing  project.   The  construction  began  on  September  10,  2008 
and should be completed March 1, 2009. 
 
South Mill Creek Plaza Cinema Complex                       
South  Mill  Creek  Plaza  is  a  mixed-use  lifestyle,  ground-up  development  on  approximately  7 
acres.  The  site  is  designed  to  accommodate  a  total  of  89,000  square  feet  of  space,  featuring 
28,000 sq. feet of entertainment related retail, restaurant space and a 61,000 square feet state 
of  the  art  16  screen,  2,600  seat  multiplex  cinema.    Maya  Cinemas  North  America,  the 
developer, plans to develop the project south of Rabobank Arena and Convention Center, and 
south  of  the  railroad tracks  between  California  Avenue,  “M”  Street  and the  Kern Island  Canal.  
Maya Cinemas North America and D.W. Sivers have acquired all the property necessary for the 
development of the $32 million dollar project and will take 24 months to construct and stabilize. 
The South Mill Creek Plaza will be a major factor in reducing blight in the area and will provide 
the  Southeast  Redevelopment  Project  Area  with  an  anchor  tenant  that  will  be  a  catalyst  for 
additional development along California Avenue. The ground breaking ceremony took place in 
the of Summer 2008, construction is now underway. 
 
Southeast Bakersfield Infill Housing Project (SE)              
The City was awarded a $500,000 CalHFA loan to build affordable housing on scattered lots in 
southeast Bakersfield.  The RDA assumed all rights and obligations of the loan on February 26, 
2003.    Round  four  of  the  infill  housing  project  began  in  fall  of  2006.    Key  round  four  changes 
included: increasing the loan amount from $100K to $150K; providing down payment assistance 
in  the  form  of  the  lot  value;  and  increasing  the  project  area  boundary  to  include  the  entire 
Southeast  Redevelopment  Project  area.    These  changes  are  necessary  due  to  rising 
construction  and  lot  costs.    The  agreement  time  frame  will  be  in  place  for  two  years  and  the 
contractor will be obligated to complete at least four homes within the two-year period.  To date, 
a total of seventeen new homes have been constructed.  When the program was first initiated 
lots were available in the price range of $7,000 to $10,000.  Currently, this range has increased 
to $65,000 to $90,000.  The Agency will be using 7 of the purchased tax defaulted properties to 
sell to a contractor for construction of the affordable homes. 
 
The contractor has completed the construction of a home at 226 East 6th Street and has begun 
constructing their third home located at 1213 Murdock Street.  The anticipated completion date 
is  August  2008.    In  addition,  staff  is  working  with  Habitat  for  Humanity,  Golden  Empire  to 
participate in the program.  Staff anticipates construction of a new home at 1812 Filson Street to 
begin in September of 2008.   
 
Bakersfield  College  continues  to  participate  in  the  Southeast  Infill  Housing  Program  through 
their  Construction  Alliance  for  Student  Achievement  (CASA)  project.    The  project  allows 
participating students to receive construction trade training and job related experience.  Through 
the  Redevelopment  Agency,  the  Bakersfield  College  Foundation  obtained  title  to  three  tax 
default  properties  located  at  339  Brown,  124  Hayes  and  301  Owens  Streets.    The  first  home 
located at 339 Brown Street is complete and has been sold to a low-income family.

State Water Resources Board – Orphan Grant                   
Clean  up  work  on  this  contaminated  site  continues.    The  city-owned  property  at  1433  Union 
Avenue  is  the  subject  of  a  grant  from  the  State  Water  Resources  Control  Board  to  pay  for 
removal  of  the  contaminated  soil  and  backfilling  with  clean  soil.    Excavation  work  was 
completed the first week of October and completion is on schedule for the end of 2008. 
 
19th Street Plaza                         
This  proposed  mixed  use  project  adjacent  to  the  Mill  Creek  Linear  Park  would  include  office, 
commercial, and residential space.  The developer envisions approximately 35,000 square feet 
of office and commercial space with a restaurant in a four level building adjacent to the canal; 
67 one and two-bedroom units of affordable senior rental housing in a three story structure; a 
3,000  square  foot  food  court;  and  an  80  space  parking  garage.    The  RDA  has  entered  into  a 
Disposition and Development Agreement with Southwest Consulting, Inc. to build the project on 
approximately  2.5  acres  of  vacant  land  east  of  the  canal  between  18th  Street  and  19th  Street, 
501 -19th Street.  Engineering and architectural plans are in site plan review. 
 
Debt Service Funds 
 
The redevelopment debt service funds account for the various debts of the Agency.  The vast 
majority  of  payments  made  during  the  2007-08  fiscal  year  were  related  to  the  Downtown 
Redevelopment Project Area. The largest, a $1,200,000 reimbursement to the City, for the City 
assuming  prior  Agency  debt  as  a  component  of  the  1997  Certificates  of  Participation  (COP) 
issued to finance the construction of the Centennial Garden Arena. 
 
Independent Audit 
 
The  Agency  has  retained  the  certified  public  accounting  firm  of  Brown  Armstrong  Paulden 
McCown Starbuck Thornburgh & Keeter, Accountancy Corporation to audit the financial records 
and financial statements included in this report.  The auditor's opinion is included in this report.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
The  financial  statements  presented  herein  include  all  of  the  activities  of  the  Bakersfield 
Redevelopment  Agency 
integrated  approach  as  prescribed  by 
Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board  (GASB)  Statement  No.  34.    The  Agency’s  basic 
financial  statements  are  comprised  of  three  components:  1)  government-wide  financial 
statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements.  This report 
also  contains  other  supplementary  information  in  addition  to  the  basic  financial  statements 
themselves.   
 
The Government-Wide Financial Statements  are  designed  to  provide  readers  with  a  broad 
overview  of  the  Agency’s  finances,  in  a  manner  similar  to  a  private-sector  business.    The 
statements  present  the  financial  picture  of  the  Agency  from  the  economic  resources 
measurement  focus  using  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting.    They  present  governmental 
activities  and  business-type  activities  separately.    Currently,  the  Agency  does  not  have  any 
business-type activities or operations.   
 
The Fund Financial Statements  include  statements  for  governmental  activities  –  the  agency 
does  not  have  any  business-type  or  fiduciary-type  funds.    The  governmental  activities  are 
prepared using the current financial resources measurement focus and modified accrual basis 
of  accounting.    The  business-type  activities  are  prepared  using  the  economic  resources 
measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting.  Reconciliations of the Fund Financial 
Statements  to  the  Government-Wide  Financial  Statements  are  provided  to  explain  the 
differences created by the integrated approach.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Government-Wide Financial Statements 
 
The Statement of Net Assets and the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net Assets 
 
The Statement of Net Assets and the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net Assets report 
information about the Agency as a whole and about its activities. These statements include all 
assets and liabilities of the Agency using the accrual basis of accounting, which is similar to the 
accounting  used  by  most  private-sector  companies.  All  of  the  current  year's  revenues  and 
expenses are taken into account, regardless of when cash is received or paid. 
 
These two statements report the Agency's net assets and changes in them. Net assets are the 
difference  between  assets  and  liabilities,  which  is  one  way  to  measure  the  Agency's  financial 
health, or financial position. Over time, increases or decreases in the Agency's net assets are 
one  indicator  of  whether  its  financial  health  is  improving  or  deteriorating.  Considering  the  fact 
that  the  main  purpose  of  a  Redevelopment  Agency  is  to  incur  debt,  one  would  expect  to  see 
Liabilities exceeding Assets on a regular basis. 
 
In the Statement of Net Assets and the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net Assets, we 
report the Agency activities as governmental activities, which are further defined as follows: 
 

Governmental  activities  –  All  of  the  Agency’s  basic  services  are  reported  in  this 
category, including Operations, Debt Service and Housing activities.  These activities are 
generally financed by property tax increment funds. 

 
 
FUND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
The  fund  financial  statements  provide  detailed  information  about  the  most  significant  funds  -- 
not  the  Agency  as  a  whole.  Some  funds  are  required  to  be  established  by  State  law  and  by 
bond covenants. However, management establishes other funds to help it control and manage 
money  for  particular  purposes,  or  to  show  that  it  is  meeting  legal  responsibilities  for  using 
certain taxes, grants, and other money. 
 
Governmental  funds  -    Most  of  the  Agency's  basic  services  are  reported  in  governmental 
funds,  which  focus  on  how  money  flows  into  and  out  of  those  funds  and  the  balances  left  at 
year-end that are available for spending. These funds are reported using an accounting method 
called modified accrual accounting, which measures cash and all other financial assets that can 
readily be converted to cash. The governmental fund statements provide a detailed short-term 
view  of  the  Agency's  general  government  operations  and  the  basic  services  it  provides. 
Governmental  fund  information  helps  determine  whether  there  are  more  or  fewer  financial 
resources  that  can  be  spent  in  the  near  future  to  finance  the  Redevelopment  programs.  The 
differences of results in the Governmental fund financial statements to those in the Government-
Wide 
following  each 
Governmental Fund financial statement. 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements - The notes provide additional information that is essential 
to  a  full  understanding  of  the  data  provided  in  the  Government-Wide  and  Fund  financial 
statements.

Other Information - In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this 
report  also  presents  certain  “required  supplementary  information”  concerning  budgetary 
comparison schedules for the major funds. 
 
 
GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 
 
As noted earlier, the basic purpose of a Redevelopment Agency is to incur debt, and one would 
generally expect an agency’s liabilities to exceed assets at any given point in time.  In the case 
of  the  Bakersfield  Redevelopment  Agency,  liabilities  exceeded  assets  by  $16,504,988  at  the 
close of the most recent fiscal year.  By far the largest portion of the Bakersfield Redevelopment 
Agency’s  liabilities  (negative  net  assets)  reflects  its  long  term  debt  obligations  regarding  the 
1997 Convention Center expansion project.   
 
The  Agency  incurs  long  term  debt  to  facilitate  redevelopment  of  blighted  areas.    The  debt  is 
generally repaid from the collection of property tax increment funds.  Capital assets constructed 
or  acquired  with  Agency  funds  become  assets  of  (and  are  maintained  by)  the  City  Of 
Bakersfield.    The  City  uses  these  capital  assets  to  provide  services  to  citizens;  consequently, 
these  assets  are  not  available  for future  spending.    Please  note  that  the  resources  needed to 
repay  this  debt  must  be  provided  from  other  sources,  since the  capital assets  themselves  are 
not available to liquidate these liabilities.

A portion of the Agency’s net assets represent resources that are subject to external restrictions 
on  how  they  may  be  used.    The  majority  of  these  restricted  assets  pertain  to  redevelopment 
housing funds, which equaled $5,198,999 at the end of the most current fiscal year. 
 
During  the  current  fiscal  year  the  net  assets  of  the  Agency  increased  by  $5,547,283  with  the 
majority of the increase related to a 26% increase in property tax increment revenue.  
 
The  Agency’s  programs  for  governmental  activities  include  operations,  housing  and  debt 
service.  A comparison of each program’s revenues and expenses for the current year and prior 
year is presented below.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT’S FUNDS  
 
As  noted  earlier,  the  Bakersfield  Redevelopment  Agency  uses  fund  accounting  to  ensure  and 
demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. 
 
Governmental funds - The focus of the Agency’s governmental funds is to provide information 
on  near-term  inflows,  outflows,  and  balances  of  spendable  resources.    Such  information  is 
useful in assessing the Agency’s financing requirements.  In particular, unreserved fund balance 
may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net resources available for spending at the 
end of the fiscal year. 
 
As of the end of the current fiscal year, the Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency’s governmental 
funds  reported  combined  ending  fund  balances  of  $14,445,668,  an  increase  of  $3,667,143  in 
comparison  with  the  prior  year.    Approximately  50%  of  the  total  fund  balance  $7,205,081 
constitutes  unreserved  fund  balance,  which  is  available  for  spending  at  the  Agency’s 
discretion.  The remainder of fund balance is reserved to indicate that it is not available for new 
spending because it has already been committed 1) to liquidated contracts and purchase orders 
of the prior period ($2,033,194), 2) to fund redevelopment housing projects ($5,198,999) or 3) to 
pay debt service ($8,394). 
 
 
CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION 
 
Capital Assets - The Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency’s investment in capital assets for its 
governmental  activities  as  of  June  30,  2008,  amounts  to  $13,163,797  (net  of  accumulated 
depreciation).    This  investment  in  capital  assets  represents  land  purchased  for future  low  and 
moderate income housing projects and other redevelopment related opportunities.

Total governmental

During the current fiscal year the Agency’s total debt increased by $5,130,488.  New debt was 
incurred during the year.  
 
Certificates  of  Participation  issued  by  the  City  and  the  Bakersfield  Redevelopment  Agency  in 
2006  carry  a  Reserve  Fund  Surety  from  Ambac  Assurance  Company.  Moody’s  Investor’s 
service has lowered its rating on Ambac, from “Aaa” to “Aa3”.  The current underlying rating on 
the Certificates has not been revised (currently “A2”).  Such reduced rating on the Certificates 
reflects only the view of Moody’s, and any desired explanation of the significance of such rating 
should be obtained from Moody’s.  There is no assurance that such rating will continue for any 
given  period  of  time  or  that  such  rating  will  not  be  revised  or  withdrawn  by  Moody’s  if,  in  the 
judgment of Moody’s, circumstances so warrant  
 

BUGETARY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
Differences  between  the  Agency’s  original  budget  and  the  final  amended  budget  reflect  an 
increase in appropriations of approximately $619,000 for future land acquisition in Old Towne 
Kern Project Area. 

 
ECONOMIC FACTORS AND NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET 
 
The key assumptions in the Agency revenue forecast for fiscal year 2007-08 were: 
 
Tax increment for the Downtown area is generally committed to existing debt service, with the 
exception of housing set aside funds. 
 
New items specifically addressed in the 2008-09 budget were: 
 
Debt Service – Assure funding of current year debt service requirements. 
  
Operations  –  Administrative  and  professional  services  support  for  project  development  and 
implementation.  
 
Housing – Continued support of the Redevelopment Housing Project.

RECONCILIATION OF THE GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS

STATEMENT OF REVENUES, EXPENDITURES AND CHANGES IN 

FUND BALANCES TO THE GOVERNMENT-WIDE

STATEMENT OF ACTIVITES AND CHANGES IN NET ASSETS

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2008

Net Change in Fund Balances - Total Governmental Funds

Amounts reported for Governmental Activities in the Statement of Activities
are different because:

Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However, in the
statement of activities the cost of those assets are capitalized and allocated over
their estimated useful lives and reported as depreciation expense. This is the
amount by which capital outlays exceeded depreciation in the current period.

Lease revenues received from the City are partially offset by a reimbursement
payment made by the Agency to the City. This amount represents the portion of
lease revenue related to the City / Agency reimbursement agreement.

Debt related proceeds provide current
financial resources to Governmental
Funds, but issuing debt increases long-term liabilities in the Government Wide
Statement of Net Assets. Repayment of debt principal
is an expenditure in
Governmental Funds, but the repayment reduces long-term liabilities in the
Government-Wide Statement of Net Assets:

This amount represents note / certificate proceeds

This amount represents long-term debt repayments

This amount represents Contributed Capital to/from primary government. Debt
will be paid through RDA, but the asset (Firestation #5) is contributed capital to
the City.

is reported in the Government-Wide

NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
The Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency (Agency) was created by Ordinance No. 1709 of the City of Bakersfield 
(City)  City  Council,  adopted  on  December  18,  1967.    The  Agency  was  organized  pursuant  to  the  Community 
Redevelopment Law of California which is codified as Part 1 of Division 24 of the State of California Health and 
Safety code. 
 
Amendments to the bylaws were adopted at a special meeting held on May 18, 1987 and the official name of the 
Agency was changed to the Central District Development Agency of the City of Bakersfield. 
 
The Agency formed two additional projects areas in July 1999.  This caused the Agency to reevaluate the name 
change made in 1987.  Additional amendments to the bylaws were adopted at a regular meeting held on January 
3, 2000 and the official name of the Agency was changed to the Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency. 
 
Members of the Agency are nominated by the Mayor and approved by the City Council. 
 
The  accounting  policies  of  the  Agency  conform  to  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  as  applicable  to 
governments. 
 
The  Bakersfield  Redevelopment  Agency  is  a  component  of  the  City  of  Bakersfield.    Accordingly,  the  financial 
operations of the Agency have also been included in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report issued by the 
City of Bakersfield. 
 
The Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency is made up of three separate project areas: 
 
 
 
 
 
The accounting for each of these project areas is accomplished through a combination of several different funds 
to account for the various aspects of each project area.

The basic financial statements of the City are composed of the following: 
 

•  Government-wide financial statements 

•  Fund financial statements 

•  Notes to the financial statements 

Financial  reporting  is  based  upon  all  GASB  pronouncements,  as  well  as  the  FASB  Statements  and 
Interpretations,  APB Opinions, and Accounting Research Bulletins that  were  issued  on or  before November 
30, 1989 that do not conflict with or contradict GASB pronouncements.  FASB Pronouncements issued after 
November 30, 1989 are not followed in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. 
 
Government-wide Financial Statements 
 

Government-wide financial statements display information about the Agency as a whole.  These statements 
include separate columns for the government and business-type activities of the primary government.  The 
Redevelopment Agency of the City of Bakersfield has no business-type activities.

Government-wide Financial Statements (Continued) 

Eliminations have been made in the Statement of Activities so that certain allocated expenses are recorded 
only once (by the function to which they were allocated).  However, general government expenses have not 
been allocated as indirect expenses to the various functions of the Agency. 
 
Government-wide financial statements are presented using the economic resources measurement focus and 
the  accrual  basis  of  accounting.    Under  the  economic  resources  measurement  focus,  all  (both  current  and 
long-term) economic resources and obligations of the reporting government are reported in the government-
wide financial statements.  Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenses are recognized in the 
accounts  and  reported  in  the  financial  statements.    Under  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting,  revenues, 
expenses,  gains,  losses,  assets,  and  liabilities  resulting  from  exchange  and  exchange-like  transactions  are 
recognized  when  the  exchange  takes  place.    Revenues,  expenses,  gains,  losses,  assets,  and  liabilities 
resulting  from  nonexchange  transaction  are  recognized  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  GASB 
Statement No. 33. 
 
Program  revenues  include  charges  for  services,  operating  grants  and  contributions,  and  interest  earnings 
restricted by program.  Program revenues are netted with program expenses in the statement of activities to 
present the net cost of each program. 
 
Amounts paid to acquire capital assets are capitalized as assets in the government-wide financial statements, 
rather  than  reported  as  an  expenditure.    Proceeds  of  long-term  debt  are  recorded  as  a  liability  in  the 
government-wide  financial  statements,  rather  than  as  an  other  financing  source.    Amounts  paid  to  reduce 
long-term indebtedness of the reporting government are reported as a reduction of the related liability, rather 
than as an expenditure. 
 
Fund Financial Statements 

The underlying accounting system of the Agency is organized and operated on the basis of separate funds, 
each of which is considered to be a separate accounting entity.  The operations of each fund are accounted 
for  with  a  separate  set  of  self-balancing  accounts  that  comprise  its  assets,  liabilities,  fund  equity,  revenues 
and expenditures or expenses, as appropriate.  Governmental resources are allocated to and accounted for in 
individual funds based upon the purposes for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending 
activities are controlled. 
 
Fund  financial  statements  for  the  primary  government’s  governmental  funds  are  presented  after  the 
government-wide  financial  statements.    These  statements  display  information  about  the  major  funds 
individually and non-major funds in the aggregate for governmental funds. 
 
Governmental Funds 
 
In  the  fund  financial  statements,  governmental  funds  are  presented  using  the  modified-accrual  basis  of 
accounting.    Their  revenues  are  recognized  when  they  become  measurable  and  available  as  net  current 
assets.   Measurable means that the amounts can be estimated, or otherwise determined.   Available means 
that the amounts were collected during the reporting period or soon enough thereafter (normally 60-90 days) 
to be available to finance the expenditures accrued for the reporting period. 
 
Revenue  recognition  is  subject  to  the  measurable  and  availability  criteria  for  the  governmental  funds  in  the 
fund financial statements.  Exchange transactions are recognized as revenues in the period in which they are 
earned  (i.e.,  the  related  goods  or  services  are  provided).    Locally  imposed  derived  tax  revenues  are 
recognized  as

A.  Basis of Accounting, Measurement Focus, and Financial Statement Presentation (Continued) 

 
Governmental Funds (Continued) 
 
upon which they are based takes place.  Imposed non-exchange transactions are recognized as revenues in 
the period for which they were imposed.  If the period of use is not specified, they are recognized as revenues 
when  an  enforceable  legal  claim  to  the  revenues  arises  or  when  they  are  received,  whichever  occurs  first.  
Government-mandated  and  voluntary  non-exchange  transactions  are  recognized  as  revenues  when 
applicable eligibility requirements have been met. 
 
In  the  fund  financial  statements,  governmental  funds  are  presented  using  the  current  financial  resources 
measurement focus.  This means that only current assets and current liabilities are generally included on their 
balance sheets.  The reported fund balance (net current assets) is considered to be a measure of “available 
spendable  resources.”    Governmental  fund  operating  statements  present  increases  (revenues  and  other 
financing sources) and decreases (expenditures and other financing uses) in net current assets.  Accordingly, 
they are said to present a summary of sources and uses of “available spendable resources” during a period. 
 
Non-current portions of long-term receivables due to governmental funds are reported on their balance sheets 
in spite of their spending measurement focus. 
 
Special  reporting  treatments  are  used  to  indicate,  however,  that  they  should  not  be  considered  “available 
spendable resources,” since they do not represent net current assets.  Recognition of governmental fund type 
revenue  represented  by  non-current  receivables  are  deferred  until  they  become  current  receivables.    Non-
current portion of other long-term receivables are offset by fund balance reserve accounts. 
 
Because of their spending measurement focus, expenditure recognition for governmental fund types excludes 
amounts  represented  by  non-current  liabilities.    Since  they  do  not  affect  net  current  assets,  such  long-term 
amounts are not recognized as governmental fund type expenditures or fund liabilities. 
 
Amounts  expended  to  acquire  capital  assets  are  recorded  as  expenditures  in  the  year  that  resources  were 
expended,  rather  than  as  fund  assets.    The  proceeds  of  long-term  debt  are  recorded  as  other  financing 
sources rather than as a fund liability.  Amounts paid to reduce long-term indebtedness are reported as fund 
expenditures. 
 
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are combined in a fund, expenses are considered to be paid 
first from restricted resources, and then from unrestricted resources.

C.  Reconciliation of Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements 

Explanation  of  Certain  Differences  between  Government  Funds  Balance  Sheet  and  the  Government-wide 
Statement of Net Assets 
 
“Total  fund  balances”  of  the  Agency’s  governmental  funds,  $14,445,668,  differs  from  “net  assets”  of 
governmental  activities,  ($16,504,988),  reported  in  the  statement  of  net  assets.    This  difference  primarily 
results  from  the  long-term  economic  focus  of  the  statement  of  net  assets  versus  the  current  financial 
resources focus of the governmental fund balance sheets. 
 
Capital Related Items - When capital assets (property, plant, equipment) that are to be used in governmental 
activities  are  purchased  or  constructed,  the  cost  of  those  assets  are  reported  as  expenditures  in 
governmental funds.  However, the statement of net assets includes those capital assets among the assets of 
the Agency as a whole.

C.  Reconciliation of Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements (Continued) 

 
Explanation of differences between governmental fund operating statements and  
the government-wide statement of activities. 
 
The “net change in fund balances” for governmental funds, $3,667,143, differs from the “change in net assets” 
for  governmental  activities,  $5,547,283  as  reported  in  the  statement  of  activities.    The  differences  arise 
primarily  from  the  long-term  economic  focus  of  the  statement  of  activities  versus  the  current  financial 
resources focus of the governmental funds.  The effect of the differences is illustrated below. 
 
Capital Expenditure Transactions - Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures.  However, 
in the statement of activities the cost of those assets are capitalized and, if applicable, depreciated over their 
useful lives. 
 

Capital outlay expenditures 

 $             7,057,647   

 
Long-term Debt Transactions - Some expenses reported in the statements of activities do not require the 
use  of  current  financial  resources  and  therefore  are  not  reported  as  expenditures  in  governmental  funds. 
Repayment of long-term debt principal is reported as an expenditure in governmental funds and, thus, has the 
effect of reducing fund balance because current financial resources have  been used.  For  the Agency as a 
whole, however, the principal payments reduce the liabilities in the Statement of Net Assets and do not result 
in an expense in the statement of activities.

Reclassification and Eliminations 
 
Interfund balances must generally be eliminated in the government-wide financial statements, except for net 
residual  amounts  due  between  governmental  activities.    Any  allocations  must  reduce  the  expenses  of  the 
function  from  which  the  expenses  are  being  allocated,  so  that  expenses  are  reported  only  once  –  in  the 
function in  which they  are  allocated.  Certain reclassifications  were also made to conform the fund financial 
statements’ expenditure classifications to those required for the statement of activities.

JUNE 30, 2008 

 

A  proposed  operating  budget  for  the  fiscal  year  commencing  on  July  1  is  submitted  to  the  Agency  by  the 
Executive Director.  After adoption of the budget, formal budgetary integration is employed during the year as  
a  management  control.    Budgetary  accounts  are  entered  in  fund  ledgers  and  are  monitored  to  control 
expenditures and enforce revenue provisions. 
 
Excess of Expenditures Over Appropriations 
 
For  the  year  ended  June  30,  2008  Expenditures  exceeded  Appropriations  in  the  nondepartmental 
expenditures of the Southeast Project Area Operating Fund and the Old Town Kern Project Area Operating 
Fund  by  $15,491  and  $1,871,  respectively.    Debt  service  expenditures  of  the  Southeast  Project  Area  Debt 
Service Fund and the Downtown Area Debt Service Fund exceeded appropriations by $7,979 and $12,034.  
These over-expenditures were funded by greater than anticipated revenues in these funds. 
 
Cash and Investments 
 
The  Agency  applies  Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board  Statement  Number  31,  Accounting  and 
Financial  Reporting  for  Certain  Investments  and  for  External  Investment  Pools.    The  statement  generally 
requires that  investments be reported at their fair market value and that all changes in fair market value be 
reflected in income of the period in which they occur. 
 
Agency  cash  is  pooled  with  the  City  of  Bakersfield  in  order  to  take  advantage  of  an  effective  investment 
program.  Pooled cash not required for day-to-day financial transactions is invested in short-term government 
securities,  bankers’  acceptances,  time  deposits  and  other  liquid  assets  to  maximize  interest  earnings.    The 
amount of individual fund pooled cash is controlled through the general ledger and investment earnings are 
allocated to individual funds based on average cash balances during the fiscal year. 
 
As  more  fully  discussed  in  Note  2,  the  Agency  also  has  investments  held  by  fiscal  agents  pledged  to  the 
payment or security of certain debt issues. 
 
Capital Assets 
 
Capital assets (including infrastructure) are recorded at cost where historical records are available and at an 
estimated  original  cost  where  no  historical  records  exist.    Contributed  fixed  assets  are  valued  at  their 
estimated  fair  market  value  at  the  date  of  the  contribution.    Generally,  fixed  asset  purchases  in  excess  of 
$5,000 are capitalized if they have an expected useful life of three years or more. 
 
Capital  assets  include  land  and  public  domain  (infrastructure)  general  fixed  assets  consisting  of  certain 
improvements including roads, streets, sidewalks, medians, and storm drains. 
 
Property Taxes 
 
In  1978,  a  state  constitutional  amendment  (Proposition  13)  provided  that  the  tax  rate  be  limited  to  1%  of 
market  value,  levied  only  by  the  County  and  shared  with  all  other  jurisdictions.    Such  limitation  on  the  rate 
may  only  be  increased  through  voter  approval.    The  County  collects  property  taxes  and  distributes  them  to 
taxing jurisdictions on the basis of the taxing jurisdiction’s assessed valuations and on the tax rate for voter-
approved debt. 
 
The property tax calendar for the Agency is as follows: 
 

Valuation date 
Lien date 
Levy dates 
Due dates 
Collection dates 

January 1 
March 1 
July 1 through June 30

D.  Other Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 
Use of Estimates 
 
The preparation  of financial statements in conformity  with  generally  accepted accounting principles requires 
management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities 
and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported 
amounts of revenues and expenditures/expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from 
those estimates. 
 

NOTE 2 – CASH AND INVESTMENTS 
 
Cash and investment of the Agency are pooled and invested with all other funds of the City.  The Agency’s portion 
of this amount was $13,654,032  (market value) at June 30, 2008. 
 
Investment authorized by California Government Code and the City’s Investment Policy 
 
The  table  below  identifies  the  investment  types  that  are  authorized  for  the  City  by  the  California  Government 
Code, or the City’s investment policy, where more restrictive.  These statutory and local restrictions also apply to 
the Redevelopment Agency, a discretely presented component unit of the City. The table also identifies the more 
restrictive provision of the California Government Code or the City’s investment policy that address interest rate 
risk, credit risk, and concentration of credit risk.  This table does not address investment of debt proceeds held by 
bond trustee that are governed by the provisions of the City’s debt agreements, rather than the general provisions 
of either the California Government Code or the City’s investment policy.

Interest Rate Risk 
 
Interest  rate  risk  is  the  risk  that  changes  in  the  market  interest  rates  will  adversely  affect  the  fair  value  of  an 
investment.    Generally,  the  longer  the  maturity  of  an  investment,  the  greater  the  sensitivity  of  its  fair  value  to 
changes  in  market  interest  rates.    As  part  of  the  City’s  investment  policy,  one  of  the  ways  that  the  City 
manages  its  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  is  by  purchasing  a  combination  of  shorter  term  and  longer  term 
investments and by timing cash flows from maturities so that a portion of the portfolio is maturing or coming close 
to maturing evenly over time as necessary to provide the cash flow and liquidity needed for operations. 
 
Information about the sensitivity of the fair values of the City’s investments (in which the Agency funds are pooled) 
to  market  interest  rate  fluctuations  is  provided  by  the  following  table  that  shows  the  distribution  of  the  City’s 
investments by maturity:

Investments with Fair Values Highly Sensitive to Interest Rate Fluctuations 
 
Except  as  inherent  by  their  nature  as  disclosed  above  the  City’s  investments  (including  those  held  by  a  bond 
trustee) are not highly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. 
 
Credit Risk 
 
Generally,  credit  risk  is  the  risk  that  an  issuer  of  an  investment  will  not  fulfill  its  obligations  to  the  holder  of  the 
investment.    This  is  measured  by  the  assignment  of  a  rating  by  a  nationally  recognized  statistical  rating 
organization.  Presented below is the minimum rating required by the California Government Code, or the City’s 
investment policy, or debt agreements, and the actual rating as of year end for each investment type.

Concentration of Credit Risk 
 
The  City’s  investment  policy  does  not  limit  the  amount  that  can  be  invested  in  any  one  issuer  beyond  the 
limitations  stipulated  by  the  California  Government  Code.    Investments  in  any  one  issuer  (other  than  U.S. 
Treasury securities, mutual funds and external investment pools) that represent 5% or more of the total City’s total 
investments are as follows.

Custodial Credit Risk 
 
Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that the City will not be able to recover its deposits or will not be able to 
recover  collateral  securities  in  the  possession  of  an  outside  party  if  a  depository  institution  fails.    The  custodial 
credit risk for investments is the risk that the City will not be able to recover the value of its investment or collateral 
securities  held  by  another  party  if  the  counterparty  (e.g.  broker-dealer)  to  a  transaction  fails.    The  California 
Government  Code  and  City’s  investment  policy  do  not  contain  legal  or  policy  requirements  that  would  limit 
exposure  to  custodial  credit  risk  for  deposits  or  investments,  other  than  the  following  provision  applicable  to 
deposits:  The California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits made by state or 
local  governmental  units  by  pledging  securities  in  an  undivided  collateral  pool  held  by  a  depository  regulated 
under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit).  The market value of the pledged securities in the 
collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amount deposited by the public agencies.  California law also 
allows financial institutions to secure City deposits by pledging first trust deed mortgage notes having a value of 
150% of the secured public deposits. 
 
As of June 30, 2008, all of the City’s deposits with financial institutions in excess of federal depository insurance 
limits were held in fully collateralized accounts, as permitted by the California Government Code.  As of June 30, 
2008, all of the City’s investments were held by the City itself or by a broker-dealer (counterparty) other than the 
broker-dealer used by the City to purchase the securities. 
 
Investment in State Investment Pool 
 
The City is a voluntary participant in the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) that is regulated by the California 
Government  Code  under  the  oversight  of  the  Treasurer  of  the  State  of  California.    The  fair  value  of  the  City’s 
investments in this pool is reported in the accompanying financial statements at amounts based upon the City’s 
pro-rata share of the fair value provided by LAIF for the entire LAIF portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of 
that  portfolio).    The  balance  available  for  withdrawals  is  based  on  the  accounting  records  maintained  by  LAIF, 
which are recorded on an amortized cost basis. 
 
NOTE 3 – CONVENTION CENTER ARENA / CAPITAL LEASE RECEIVABLE 
 
In March, 1997, the Agency and the City entered into a reimbursement agreement in consideration of the City’s 
actions to refund the Agency’s prior bonds and undertake the Convention center Expansion-Arena Project, 1997.  
The  Agency  agreed  to  reimburse  the  City  up  to  $1,200,000  annually  from  available  tax  revenues  in  fifty  semi-
annual installments not to exceed $600,000 each, due and payable by December 31, and June 30, commencing 
December 31, 1997, and ending June 30, 2022.

NOTE 3 – CONVENTION CENTER ARENA / CAPITAL LEASE RECEIVABLE  (Continued) 
 
The  Agency  leased  the  improvements  to  the  City  pursuant  to  a  lease  agreement  entered  into  on  April  1,  1997.  
That  lease  expires  April  1,  2022,  provided  all  Certificates  of  Participation  principal  and  interest  incurred  by  the 
agency  to  construct  the  improvements  have  been  fully  paid  and  retired.    Upon  termination  of  the  lease,  the 
improvements will become the property of the City. 
  
A portion of the lease payment for October 1, 1997, April 1 and October 1, 1998 and April 1, 1999, was paid from 
the capitalized interest account, reducing the City’s payment correspondingly.

BUDGETARY INFORMATION 
 
Through the budget process, members of the Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency and the members of 
the  Bakersfield  City  Council  set  the  direction  of  the  Agency  and  the  City,  allocate  it’s  resources  and 
establish  it’s  priorities.    The  annual  budget  assures  the  efficient  and  effective  use  of  economic 
resources, as well as establishing that the highest priority objectives are accomplished. 
 
The  annual  budget  serves  from  July  1  to  June  30,  and  is  a  vehicle  that  accurately  and  openly 
communicates  these  priorities  to  the  community,  businesses,  vendors,  employees  and  other  public 
agencies.    Additionally,  it  establishes  the  foundation  of  effective  financial  planning  by  providing 
resource  planning,  performance  measures  and  controls  that  permit  the  evaluation  and  adjustment  of 
the Agency’s performance.  
 
The budget process begins as a team effort in January of each year, starting with an annual strategic 
planning  meeting.    Then  the  individual  departments  use  projected  revenue  assumptions  to  prioritize 
and  recommend  the  next  fiscal  year’s  objectives.    The  City  Manager’s  Office  and  the  Finance 
Department  review  all  budget  proposals  and  revenues  assumptions,  as  well  as  all  current  financial 
obligations  before  preparing  the  document  that  is  proposed  to  the  Members  of  the  Redevelopment 
Agency.   
 
The  Members  of the  Agency  review  the  proposed  budget,  and  after  their  comments  are  incorporated 
into  the  document,  the  budget  is  submitted  to  the  City  Council  for  final  approval.    The  City  Council 
reviews  the  Proposed  Budget  through  a  series  of  workshops  and  the  final  adoption  of  the  budget  is 
normally scheduled for the second City Council meeting each June. 
 
At the beginning of each fiscal year, certain appropriations are “carried forward” from the prior budget 
year.    These  items  generally  relate  to  either  open  encumbrances  that  exist  at  June  30,  or  capital 
projects that were budgeted in the prior fiscal year that did not progress to the encumbrance stage as of 
June 30.  Amounts carried forward from fiscal year 2006-07 to fiscal year 2007-08 totaled $11,543,551.   
 
The  following  schedules  represent  budgetary  comparisons  for  all  major  funds  within  the  Bakersfield 
Redevelopment Agency.

FORM OF BOND COUNSEL FINAL OPINION

(SERIES 2009A BONDS)

Closing Date, 2009

Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency
Bakersfield, California

Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency
Tax Allocation Bonds, Series 2009A

(Final Opinion)

(Tax-Exempt – Tax Increment Revenue)

Old Town Kern-Pioneer Redevelopment Project

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Bakersfield Redevelopment Agency (the “Issuer”)
in connection with issuance of $2,090,000 principal amount of the Issuer’s Tax Allocation
Bonds, Series 2009A (Tax-Exempt – Tax Increment Revenue), Old Town Kern-Pioneer
Redevelopment Project (the “Series 2009A Bonds”), issued pursuant to the provisions of the
California Community Redevelopment Law (being Part 1 of Division 24 of the California Health
and Safety Code), as amended (the “Law”), and an Indenture, dated as of July 1, 2009 (the
“Indenture”), between the Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the “Trustee”).

In such connection, we have reviewed the Indenture, the Tax Certificate of the Issuer,
dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), opinions of counsel to the Issuer, the Bakersfield
Public Financing Authority (the “Authority”) and the Trustee, certificates of the Issuer, the
Authority, the Trustee and others, and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent
we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations,
rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities.
Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date
hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions
are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after the date
hereof. Accordingly, this opinion speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not,
be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our engagement with
respect to the Bonds has concluded with their issuance and we disclaim any obligation to update
this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to us
(whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and
validity against, any parties other than the Issuer. We have assumed, without undertaking to
verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents,

E-1

and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the second paragraph
hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained
in the Indenture and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements
compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not
cause interest on the Series 2009A Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax
purposes. We call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the 2009A Bonds,
the Indenture and the Tax Certificate and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws
relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise
of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against
redevelopment agencies in the State of California (the “State”). We express no opinion with
respect to any indemnification, contribution, penalty, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of
venue, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we
express any opinion with respect to the state of quality of title to or interest in any of the assets
described in or as subject to the lien of the Indenture or the accuracy or sufficiency of the
description contained therein of, or the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such assets.
We also express no opinion regarding any calculation set forth or referred to in any of the 2009A
Bonds or
the accuracy,
completeness or fairness of the Official Statement or other offering material relating to the
2009A Bonds and express no opinion with respect thereto.

Finally, we undertake no responsibility for

in the Indenture.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we

are of the following opinions:

The 2009A Bonds constitute valid and binding limited obligations of the Issuer,

as prescribed by and in accordance with the Law and the Indenture.

1.

2.

The Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes the valid

and binding obligation of, the Issuer.

3.

The Indenture creates a valid pledge, to secure the payment of the principal of and
interest on the Series 2009A Bonds, of the Net Tax Increment Revenues, as said term is defined
in the Indenture, and any other amounts (including prescribed portions of the proceeds of the sale
of the Series 2009A Bonds) held by the Trustee in the Parity Debt Service Account within the
Redevelopment Special Fund established pursuant to the Indenture, subject to the provisions of
the Indenture permitting the application thereof for the purposes and upon the terms and
conditions set forth in the Indenture. We expressly note that the pledge of the Net Tax Increment
Revenues to secure payment of the principal of and interest on the Series 2009A Bonds is
subordinate to the pledge of the Tax Increment Revenues which secures the Senior Debt, as said
term is defined in the Indenture, and is on a parity with the pledge of a prescribed portion of the
Net Tax Increment Revenues which secures the CIEDB Payment Obligations and the pledge of
the Net Tax Increment Revenues which will secure Additional Bonds, if any, as said terms are
defined in the Indenture.

4.

The 2009A Bonds are not a lien or charge upon any funds or property of the
Issuer except to the extent of the aforementioned pledge. Neither the faith and credit nor the
taxing power of the City of Bakersfield (the “City”), the State or of any political subdivision of

E-2

the State is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on the 2009A Bonds. The
2009A Bonds are not a debt of the City, the State or any of its political subdivisions, and none of
the City, the State or any political subdivision of the State is liable for the payment thereof.

5.

Interest on the Series 2009A Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt
from personal income taxes of the State.
Interest on the Series 2009A Bonds is not a specific
preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes,
nor is it included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum
taxable income. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the
ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Series 2009A Bonds.

(a) 

if the amendment or waiver relates to the provisions of Section 3(a), 4, or 5(a), it may 
only  be  made  in  connection  with  a  change  in  circumstances  that  arises  from  a  change  in  legal 
requirements,  change  in  law,  or  change  in  the  identity,  nature,  or  status  of  an  obligated  person  with 
respect to the Bonds, or type of business conducted; 

(b) 

the undertakings herein, as proposed to be amended or waived, would, in the opinion of 
nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with the requirements of the Rule at the time of the 

F-4 

 

primary offering of the Bonds, after taking into account any amendments or interpretations of the Rule, as 
well as any change in circumstances; and  

(c) 

the proposed amendment or waiver either (i) is approved by Holders of the Bonds in the 
manner  provided  in  the  Indenture  for  amendments  to  such  Indenture  with  the  consent  of  Holders,  or 
(ii) does not, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, materially impair the interests of the 
Holders or Beneficial Owners of the Bonds. 

If  the  annual  financial  information  or  operating  data  to  be  provided  in  the  Annual  Report  is 
amended pursuant to the provisions hereof, the first annual financial information filed pursuant hereto 
containing  the  amended  operating  data  or  financial  information  shall  explain,  in  narrative  form,  the 
reasons  for  the  amendment  and  the  impact  of  the  change  in  the  type  of  operating  data  or  financial 
information being provided. 

In the event of any amendment or waiver of a provision of this Disclosure Certificate, the Agency 
shall describe such amendment in the next Annual Report, and shall include, as applicable, a narrative 
explanation of the reason for the amendment or waiver and its impact on the type (or, in the case of a 
change  of  accounting  principles,  on  the  presentation)  of  financial  information  or  operating  data  being 
presented  by  the  Agency.    If  an  amendment  is  made  to  the  undertaking  specifying  the  accounting 
principles to be followed in preparing financial statements, the annual financial information for the year in 
which  the  change  is  made  shall  present  a comparison  between  the  financial  statements  or  information 
prepared  on the  basis  of  the  new  accounting  principles  and  those  prepared  on the  basis  of  the former 
accounting  principles.    The  comparison  shall  include  a  qualitative  discussion  of  the  differences  in  the 
accounting principles and the impact of the change in the accounting principles on the presentation of the 
financial information, in order to provide information to investors to enable them to evaluate the ability of 
the  Agency  to  meet  its  obligations.    To  the  extent  reasonably  feasible,  the  comparison  shall  be 
quantitative.  A notice of the change in the accounting principles shall be sent to each Repository in the 
same manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5(c). 

Section 9. 

Additional Information.  Nothing in this Disclosure Certificate shall be deemed 
to prevent the Agency from disseminating any other information, using the means of dissemination set 
forth  in  this  Disclosure  Certificate  or  any  other  means  of  communication,  or  including  any  other 
information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event, in addition to that which is 
required by this Disclosure Certificate.  If the Agency chooses to include any information in any Annual 
Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event in addition to that which is specifically required by this 
Disclosure Certificate, the Agency shall have no obligation under this Disclosure Certificate to update 
such information or include it in any future Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event. 

Section 10. 

Default.  In the event of a failure of the Agency to comply with any provision of 
this Disclosure Certificate any Holder or Beneficial Owner of the Bonds may take such actions as may be 
necessary and appropriate, including seeking mandate or specific performance by court order, to cause the 
Agency to comply with its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate.  A default under this Disclosure 
Certificate shall not be deemed an Event of Default under the Indenture and the sole remedy under this 
Disclosure Certificate in the event of any failure of the Agency to comply with this Disclosure Certificate 
shall be an action to compel performance. 

Section 11. 

Duties, Immunities and Liabilities of Dissemination Agent.  The Dissemination 
Agent  shall  have  only  such  duties  as  are  specifically  set  forth  in  this  Disclosure  Certificate,  and  the 
Agency  agrees  to indemnify  and  save  the  Dissemination  Agent, its  officers,  directors,  employees,  and 
agents,  harmless  against  any  losses,  expenses,  and  liabilities  that  it  may  incur  arising  out  of  or in  the 
exercise or performance of its powers and duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including

securities law. 

(c) 

If the Agency determines that knowledge of the occurrence of a Listed Event would be 
material  under  applicable  federal  securities  law,  the  Agency  shall  promptly  file  a  notice  of  such 
occurrence  with  each  Repository,  with  a  copy  to  the  Trustee  and  the  Participating  Underwriter.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice of Listed Events described in subsections (a)(viii) and (ix) need not 
be  given  under  this  subsection  any  earlier  than the  notice  (if  any)  of the  underlying  event  is  given  to 
holders of affected Bonds pursuant to the Indenture. 

Section 6. 

Termination  of  Reporting  Obligation.    The  Agency(cid:146)s  obligations  under  this 
Disclosure Certificate shall terminate upon the legal defeasance, prior redemption, or payment in full of 
all of the Bonds.  If such termination occurs prior to the final maturity of the Bonds, the Agency shall 
give notice of such termination in the same manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5(c). 

Section 7. 

Dissemination Agent.  The Agency may, from time to time, appoint or engage a 
Dissemination Agent to assist it in carrying out its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate, and may 
discharge any such Dissemination Agent, with or without appointing a successor Dissemination Agent.  
The Dissemination Agent shall not be responsible in any manner for the content of any notice or report 
prepared by the Agency pursuant to this Disclosure Certificate. 

Section 8. 

Amendment;  Waiver.    Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Disclosure 
Certificate,  the  Agency  may  amend  this  Disclosure  Certificate,  and  any  provision  of  this  Disclosure 
Certificate may be waived, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: 

(a) 

if the amendment or waiver relates to the provisions of Section 3(a), 4, or 5(a), it may 
only  be  made  in  connection  with  a  change  in  circumstances  that  arises  from  a  change  in  legal 
requirements,  change  in  law,  or  change  in  the  identity,  nature,  or  status  of  an  obligated  person  with 
respect to the Bonds, or type of business conducted; 

(b) 

the undertakings herein, as proposed to be amended or waived, would, in the opinion of 
nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with the requirements of the Rule at the time of the 

F-11 

 

primary offering of the Bonds, after taking into account any amendments or interpretations of the Rule, as 
well as any change in circumstances; and  

(c) 

the proposed amendment or waiver either (i) is approved by Holders of the Bonds in the 
manner  provided  in  the  Indenture  for  amendments  to  such  Indenture  with  the  consent  of  Holders,  or 
(ii) does not, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, materially impair the interests of the 
Holders or Beneficial Owners of the Bonds. 

If  the  annual  financial  information  or  operating  data  to  be  provided  in  the  Annual  Report  is 
amended pursuant to the provisions hereof, the first annual financial information filed pursuant hereto 
containing  the  amended  operating  data  or  financial  information  shall  explain,  in  narrative  form,  the 
reasons  for  the  amendment  and  the  impact  of  the  change  in  the  type  of  operating  data  or  financial 
information being provided. 

In the event of any amendment or waiver of a provision of this Disclosure Certificate, the Agency 
shall describe such amendment in the next Annual Report, and shall include, as applicable, a narrative 
explanation of the reason for the amendment or waiver and its impact on the type (or, in the case of a 
change  of  accounting  principles,  on  the  presentation)  of  financial  information  or  operating  data  being 
presented  by  the  Agency.    If  an  amendment  is  made  to  the  undertaking  specifying  the  accounting 
principles to be followed in preparing financial statements, the annual financial information for the year in 
which  the  change  is  made  shall  present  a comparison  between  the  financial  statements  or  information 
prepared  on the  basis  of  the  new  accounting  principles  and  those  prepared  on the  basis  of  the former 
accounting  principles.    The  comparison  shall  include  a  qualitative  discussion  of  the  differences  in  the 
accounting principles and the impact of the change in the accounting principles on the presentation of the 
financial information, in order to provide information to investors to enable them to evaluate the ability of 
the  Agency  to  meet  its  obligations.    To  the  extent  reasonably  feasible,  the  comparison  shall  be 
quantitative.  A notice of the change in the accounting principles shall be sent to each Repository in the 
same manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5(c). 

Section 9. 

Additional Information.  Nothing in this Disclosure Certificate shall be deemed 
to prevent the Agency from disseminating any other information, using the means of dissemination set 
forth  in  this  Disclosure  Certificate  or  any  other  means  of  communication,  or  including  any  other 
information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event, in addition to that which is 
required by this Disclosure Certificate.  If the Agency chooses to include any information in any Annual 
Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event in addition to that which is specifically required by this 
Disclosure Certificate, the Agency shall have no obligation under this Disclosure Certificate to update 
such information or include it in any future Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event. 

Section 10. 

Default.  In the event of a failure of the Agency to comply with any provision of 
this Disclosure Certificate any Holder or Beneficial Owner of the Bonds may take such actions as may be 
necessary and appropriate, including seeking mandate or specific performance by court order, to cause the 
Agency to comply with its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate.  A default under this Disclosure 
Certificate shall not be deemed an Event of Default under the Indenture and the sole remedy under this 
Disclosure Certificate in the event of any failure of the Agency to comply with this Disclosure Certificate 
shall be an action to compel performance. 

Section 11. 

Duties, Immunities and Liabilities of Dissemination Agent.  The Dissemination 
Agent  shall  have  only  such  duties  as  are  specifically  set  forth  in  this  Disclosure  Certificate,  and  the 
Agency  agrees  to indemnify  and  save  the  Dissemination  Agent, its  officers,  directors,  employees,  and 
agents,  harmless  against  any  losses,  expenses,  and  liabilities  that  it  may  incur  arising  out  of  or in  the 
exercise or performance of its powers and duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including 

F-12 

 

attorneys  fees)  of  defending  against  any  claim  of  liability,  but  excluding  liabilities  due  to  the 
Dissemination  Agent(cid:146)s  negligence  or  willful  misconduct.    The  obligations  of  the  Agency  under  this 
section shall survive resignation or removal of the Dissemination Agent and payment of the Bonds.
