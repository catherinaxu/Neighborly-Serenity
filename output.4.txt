covenants, interest on the Series 2015 Bonds is exempt from State of California personal income taxes.  Bond Counsel observes that interest on the Series

$10,430,000 

Dated:  Date of Delivery 

Due:   November 1, as shown on inside front cover page
The Moreno Valley Public Financing Authority Lease Revenue Bonds, Series 2015 (Taxable) (the “Series 2015 Bonds”) are payable from base rental 
payments  (the  “Base  Rental  Payments”)  to  be  made  by  the  City  of  Moreno  Valley  (the  “City”)  to  the  Moreno  Valley  Public  Financing  Authority  (the 
“Authority”) for the right to use certain real property (collectively, the “Property”) pursuant to a Master Facilities Sublease, dated as of December 1, 2015 
(the “Facilities Sublease”), by and between the City, as sublessee, and the Authority, as sublessor.  See the captions “THE PROPERTY” and “SECURITY 
AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES 2015 BONDS.”   

The Series 2015 Bonds are being issued to provide funds: (i) to finance certain capital improvements of the City; (ii) to purchase a municipal bond 
insurance policy (the “Policy”) from Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. (“AGM”) to guarantee the payment of principal of and interest on the Series 2015 
Bonds; (iii) to purchase a municipal bond debt service reserve insurance policy (the “Reserve Policy”) from AGM for deposit in the Reserve Fund for the 
Series 2015 Bonds; and (iv) to pay the costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Series 2015 Bonds.  See the captions “THE FINANCING 
PLAN” and “SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS.”  The City has covenanted under the Facilities Sublease to take such action as may be necessary to 
include all Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments due thereunder in its annual budgets, and to make necessary annual appropriations for all such 
Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments.  The City’s obligation to make Base Rental Payments is subject to abatement during any period in which by 
reason of any material damage or destruction (other than by condemnation) there is substantial interference with the use and occupancy of the Property by the 
City, in the proportion in which the cost of that portion of the Property rendered unusable bears to the cost of the whole of the Property.  See the caption 
“RISK FACTORS—Abatement.” 

The Series 2015 Bonds are being issued in fully registered book-entry only form, initially registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The 
Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”).  Interest on the Series 2015 Bonds is payable semiannually on each May 1 and November 1, 
commencing May 1, 2016.  Purchasers will not receive certificates representing their interest in the Series 2015 Bonds.  Individual purchases will be in 
principal amounts of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof.  Principal of and interest and premium, if any, on the Series 2015 Bonds will be paid by Wells 
Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), to DTC for subsequent disbursement to DTC Participants, who are obligated to remit such 
payments to the Beneficial Owners of the Series 2015 Bonds.  See the caption “THE SERIES 2015 BONDS—Book-Entry Only System.” 

The Series 2015 Bonds will be issued pursuant to a Master Trust Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2015 (the “Trust Agreement”), by and among the 
City, the Authority and the Trustee.  The Series 2015 Bonds and any additional bonds issued pursuant to the Trust Agreement (“Additional Bonds”) are 
collectively referred to as the “Bonds.” 

The Series 2015 Bonds are subject to optional redemption and mandatory sinking fund redemption prior to maturity and extraordinary redemption from 

insurance or condemnation proceeds as described herein.  See the caption “THE SERIES 2015A BONDS—Redemption.” 

The Series 2015 Bonds are limited obligations of the Authority and are payable, as to interest thereon, principal thereof and any premiums 
upon the redemption of any thereof, solely from the Revenues described herein, and the Authority is not obligated to pay them except from the 
Revenues.  All of the Series 2015 Bonds are equally secured by a pledge of and charge and lien upon the Revenues, and the Revenues constitute a 
trust fund for the security and payment of the interest on and principal of and redemption premiums, if any, on the Series 2015 Bonds as provided 
herein.   

The Series 2015 Bonds are not a debt of the City, the State of the California (the “State”) or any of its political subdivisions, and neither the 
City, the State nor any of its political subdivisions is liable thereon, nor in any event shall the Series 2015 Bonds be payable out of any funds or 
properties other than those of the Authority as described herein.  The Series 2015 Bonds do not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of 
any constitutional or statutory limitation or restriction. 

The scheduled payment of principal of and interest on the Series 2015 Bonds when due will be guaranteed under an insurance policy to be issued 

concurrently with the delivery of the Series 2015 Bonds by ASSURED GUARANTY MUNICIPAL CORP.

MORENO VALLEY PUBLIC FINANCING AUTHORITY 
LEASE REVENUE BONDS, SERIES 2015 (TAXABLE) 

INTRODUCTION 

This  Official  Statement,  which  includes  the  cover  page,  the  inside  cover  page  and  the  appendices 
hereto  (the  “Official  Statement”),  provides  certain  information  concerning  the  sale  and  delivery  of  the 
$10,430,000 aggregate principal amount of Moreno Valley Public Financing Authority Lease Revenue Bonds, 
Series 2015  (Taxable)  (the  “Series  2015  Bonds”).   The  Series  2015  Bonds  are  being issued by  the  Moreno 
Valley  Public  Financing  Authority  (the  “Authority”)  pursuant  to  a  Master  Trust  Agreement,  dated  as  of 
December 1, 2015 (the “Trust Agreement”), by and between the Authority and Wells Fargo Bank, National 
Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). 

The  net  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds  will  be  used:  (i)  to  finance  certain  capital 
improvements of the City (the “Project”); (ii) to purchase a municipal bond insurance policy (the “Policy”) 
from Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. (“AGM”) to guarantee the payment of principal of and interest on the 
Series  2015  Bonds;  (iii)  to  purchase  a  municipal  bond  debt  service  reserve  insurance  policy  (the  “Reserve 
Policy”)  from  AGM  for  deposit  in  the  Reserve  Fund  for  the  Series  2015  Bonds;  and  (iv)  to  pay  the  costs 
incurred  in  connection  with  the  issuance  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds.    See  the  captions  “THE  FINANCING 
PLAN,” “BOND INSURANCE” and “SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS.” 

Security for the Series 2015 Bonds 

Pursuant to a Master Facilities Lease, dated as of December 1, 2015 (the “Facilities Lease”), by and 
between the City of Moreno Valley (the “City”) and the Authority, the City has leased certain real property and 
improvements  owned  by  the  City  (collectively,  the  “Property”)  to  the  Authority  in  consideration  for  the 
Authority’s assistance in issuing the Series 2015 Bonds. 

Pursuant to a Master Facilities Sublease, dated as of December 1, 2015 (the “Facilities Sublease”), by 
and between the City, as sublessee, and the Authority, as sublessor, the Authority has subleased the Property 
back to the City in consideration for the payment of rental payments (the “Base Rental Payments”) to be made 
by the City for the right to use the Property. 

The Series 2015 Bonds are equally and ratably payable from: (i) the Base Rental Payments and other 
payments paid by the City and received by the Authority pursuant to the Facilities Sublease (but not including 
Additional  Payments  as  described  herein);  and  (ii)  all  interest  or  other  income  from  any  investment  of  any 
money  in  any  fund  or  account  established  pursuant  to  the  Trust  Agreement  or  the  Facilities  Sublease 
(collectively,  the  “Revenues”).    The  Authority  has  assigned  its  right,  title  and  interest  in  the  Base  Rental 
Payments  and  its  right  to  enforce  remedies  under  the  Facilities  Sublease  to  the  Trustee  as  security  for  the 
payment of the Series 2015 Bonds. 

Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Authority may issue additional bonds (the “Additional Bonds”) 
payable from the Base Rental Payments on a parity with the Series 2015 Bonds (the Series 2015 Bonds and 
any such Additional Bonds being collectively referred to as the “Bonds”).  See the caption “SECURITY AND 
SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES 2015 BONDS—Additional Bonds.” 

The City has covenanted in the Facilities Sublease to take such action as may be necessary to include 
all  Base  Rental  Payments  and  Additional  Payments  due  thereunder  in  its  annual  budgets,  and  to  make 
necessary  annual  appropriations  for  all  such  Base  Rental  Payments  and  Additional  Payments,  subject  to 
abatement as described in this Official Statement.

Revenues of the City’s electric utility (the “Electric Utility”) are not pledged as security for the Series 
2015 Bonds.  However, net revenues of the Electric Utility (revenues remaining after payment of operation and 
maintenance costs thereof and debt service obligations with respect thereto) are available to pay Base Rental 
Payments,  and  the  City  currently  expects  to  pay  all  or  a  portion  of  Base  Rental  Payments  from  such  net 
revenues of the Electric Utility.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City makes no assurances regarding the 
amount of net revenues of the Electric Utility or the availability of net revenues of the Electric Utility to pay 
Base Rental Payments. 

The Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments will be abated proportionately, during any period 
in which by reason of any material damage or destruction (other than by condemnation, which is provided for 
in the Facilities Sublease) there is substantial interference with the use and occupancy of the Property by the 
City, in the proportion in which the cost of that portion of the Property rendered unusable bears to the cost of 
the  whole  of  the  Property.    See  the  caption  “RISK  FACTORS—Abatement.”    Abatement  of  Base  Rental 
Payments  under  the  Facilities  Sublease,  to  the  extent  that  payment  is  not  made  from  alternative  sources  as 
described in this Official Statement, would result in all Bond Owners receiving less than the full amount of 
principal of and interest on the Bonds.  To the extent that proceeds of insurance are available, Base Rental 
Payments (or a portion thereof) may be made during periods of abatement.  

THE  SERIES  2015  BONDS  ARE  LIMITED  OBLIGATIONS  OF  THE  AUTHORITY  AND  ARE 
PAYABLE, AS TO INTEREST THEREON, PRINCIPAL THEREOF AND ANY PREMIUMS UPON THE 
REDEMPTION  OF  ANY  THEREOF,  SOLELY  FROM  THE  REVENUES  DESCRIBED  HEREIN,  AND 
THE AUTHORITY IS NOT OBLIGATED TO PAY THEM EXCEPT FROM THE REVENUES.  ALL OF 
THE SERIES 2015 BONDS ARE EQUALLY SECURED BY A PLEDGE OF AND CHARGE AND LIEN 
UPON THE REVENUES, AND THE REVENUES CONSTITUTE A TRUST FUND FOR THE SECURITY 
AND  PAYMENT  OF  THE  INTEREST  ON  AND  PRINCIPAL  OF  AND  REDEMPTION  PREMIUMS,  IF 
ANY, ON THE SERIES 2015 BONDS AS PROVIDED HEREIN.   

THE  SERIES  2015  BONDS  ARE  NOT  A  DEBT  OF  THE  CITY,  THE  STATE  OF  THE 
CALIFORNIA  (THE  “STATE”)  OR  ANY  OF  ITS  POLITICAL  SUBDIVISIONS,  AND  NEITHER  THE 
CITY,  THE  STATE  NOR  ANY  OF  ITS  POLITICAL  SUBDIVISIONS  IS  LIABLE  THEREON,  NOR  IN 
ANY  EVENT  SHALL  THE  SERIES  2015  BONDS  BE  PAYABLE  OUT  OF  ANY  FUNDS  OR 
PROPERTIES OTHER THAN THOSE OF THE AUTHORITY AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.  THE SERIES 
2015  BONDS  DO  NOT  CONSTITUTE  AN  INDEBTEDNESS  WITHIN  THE  MEANING  OF  ANY 
CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY LIMITATION OR RESTRICTION.

obligation to make payments under the Reserve Policy; or (ii) to replace the Reserve Policy in the event of a 
rating  downgrade  of  AGM.    See  the  caption  “SECURITY  AND  SOURCES  OF  PAYMENT  FOR  THE

General 

THE SERIES 2015 BONDS 

The Series 2015 Bonds will be issued in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of 
$5,000  or  any  integral  multiple  thereof.    The  Series  2015  Bonds  will  be  dated  as  of  and  bear  interest 
(calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months) from the dated date thereof at 
the rates set forth on the inside cover page hereof.  Interest on the Series 2015 Bonds will be paid semiannually 
on each May 1 and November 1, commencing May 1, 2016 (each, an “Interest Payment Date”). 

The Series 2015 Bonds will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of 
registration thereof, unless such date of registration is an Interest Payment Date, in which event they will bear 
interest from such date, or unless such date of registration is prior to the first Interest Payment Date, in which 
event they will bear interest from their dated date.  Payment of interest on the Series 2015 Bonds due on or 
before the maturity or prior redemption thereof will be paid by check mailed by first class mail on each Interest 
Payment Date to the person in whose name the Series 2015 Bond is registered as of the applicable Record Date 
for  such  Interest  Payment  Date  at  the  address  shown  on  the  registration  books  maintained  by  the  Trustee 
pursuant to the Trust Agreement; provided, however, that interest on any Series 2015 Bonds will be paid by 
wire transfer or other means to provide immediately available funds to any Holder of at least $1,000,000 in 
aggregate  principal  amount  of  such  Series  2015  Bonds,  at  its  option,  according  to  wire  instructions  to  an 
account within the United States of America given to the Trustee in writing for such purpose and on file prior 
to the applicable Record Date preceding the Interest Payment Date.   

Interest on any Series 2015 Bond will cease to accrue: (i) on the maturity date thereof, provided that 
there has been irrevocably deposited with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the principal amount thereof, 
plus interest accrued thereon to such date; or (ii) on the redemption date thereof, provided that there has been 
irrevocably deposited with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the Redemption Price thereof, plus interest 
accrued thereon to such date.  The Holder of such Series 2015 Bond is not entitled to any other payment, and 
such  Series  2015  Bond  will  no  longer  be  Outstanding  and  entitled  to  the  benefits  of  the  Trust  Agreement, 
except for the payment of the principal amount or Redemption Price, of such Series 2015 Bond, as appropriate, 
from moneys held by the Trustee for such payment. 

The principal of the Series 2015 Bonds will be payable by check in lawful money of the United States 
of America at the Principal Office of the Trustee.  No payment of principal will be made on any Series 2015 
Bond unless and until such Series 2015 Bond is surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation.   

Redemption 

Optional Redemption.  The Series 2015 Bonds maturing on and after November 1, 2021 are subject to 
optional redemption prior to their stated Principal Payment Dates, on any date on or after November 1, 2020, 
in whole or in part, in Authorized Denominations, from and to the extent of prepaid Base Rental Payments 
paid  pursuant  to  the  Facilities  Sublease,  any  such  prepayment  to  be  at  a  Redemption  Price  equal  to  the 
principal amount of the Series 2015 Bonds to be redeemed, plus accrued interest thereon to the Redemption 
Date, without premium. 

Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption.  The Series 2015 Bonds with a stated Principal Payment Date 
of  November  1,  2035  are  subject  to  redemption  prior  to  such  stated  Principal  Payment  Date,  in  part,  from

The amount of each such redemption will be reduced proportionately in the event and to the extent of 
any and all redemptions of Series 2015 Bonds with a stated Principal Payment Date of November 1, 2035 and 
November  1,  2045,  respectively,  pursuant  to  any  provision  of  the  Trust  Agreement  other  than  redemptions 
made pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund redemption provisions of the Trust Agreement. 

Extraordinary  Redemption  from  Condemnation  Award  or  Insurance  Proceeds.    The  City  will 
prepay  on  any  date  from  insurance  and  eminent  domain  proceeds,  to  the  extent  provided  in  the  Facilities 
Sublease (provided, however, that in the event of partial damage to or destruction of the Property caused by 
perils covered by insurance, if in the judgment of the Authority the insurance proceeds are sufficient to repair, 
reconstruct or replace the damaged or destroyed portion of the Property, such proceeds will be held by the 
Trustee and used to repair, reconstruct or replace the damaged or destroyed portion of the Property, pursuant to 
the  procedure  set  forth  in  the  Facilities  Sublease  for  proceeds  of  insurance),  all  or  any  part  (in  an  integral 
multiple of $5,000 principal component) of Base Rental Payments then unpaid so that the aggregate annual 
amounts of Base Rental Payments which are payable after such prepayment date will be as nearly proportional 
as practicable to the aggregate annual amounts of Base Rental Payments unpaid prior to the prepayment date, 

 

5 

 

at  a  prepayment  amount  equal  to  the  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Series  2015  Bonds  to  the  date  of 
redemption of the Series 2015 Bonds. 

The Series 2015 Bonds are subject to redemption by the Authority on any date prior to their respective 
stated maturities, upon notice as provided in the Trust Agreement, as a whole or in part by lot within each 
stated  maturity  in  integral  multiples  of  Authorized  Denominations,  from  prepayments  from  insurance  and 
eminent domain proceeds made by the City pursuant to the Facilities Sublease (as described in the preceding 
paragraph),  at  a  redemption  price  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  principal  amount  thereof,  without  premium,  plus 
accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date.  Whenever less than all of the Outstanding Bonds are to be 
redeemed on any one date, the Trustee will select, in accordance with written directions from the Authority, 
the Bonds to be redeemed in part from the Outstanding Bonds so that the aggregate annual principal amount of 
and  interest  on  Bonds  which  are  payable  after  such  Redemption  Date  will  be  as  nearly  proportional  as 
practicable  to  the  aggregate  annual  principal  amount  of  and  interest  on  Bonds  Outstanding  prior  to  such 
Redemption Date. 

Selection of Bonds for Redemption.  If less than all Outstanding Series 2015 Bonds maturing by their 
terms on any one date are to be redeemed at any one time, the Trustee will select the Series 2015 Bonds of 
such maturity date to be redeemed at random and promptly notify the Authority in writing of the numbers of 
the Series 2015 Bonds so selected for redemption.  For purposes of such selection, Series 2015 Bonds will be 
deemed to be composed of multiples of minimum Authorized Denominations and any such multiple may be 
separately  redeemed.    In  the  event  that  Term  Bonds  are  designated  for  redemption,  the  Authority  may 
designate  which  sinking  account  payments  are  allocated  to  such  redemption,  and  in  the  absence  of  such 
Authority  designation  such  redemptions  will  be  allocated  in  inverse  order  of  Mandatory  Sinking  Account 
Payment Dates. 

Notice of Redemption; Cancellation.  Notice of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail by the 
Trustee, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date to: (i) the respective Bondholders 
of the Series 2015 Bonds designated for redemption at their addresses appearing on the registration books of 
the Trustee; (ii) the Securities Depositories; and (iii) one or more Information Services.  Notice of redemption 
to  the  Securities  Depositories  and  the  Information  Services  will  be  given  by  registered  mail  or  overnight 
delivery  or  facsimile  transmission  or  by  such  other  method  acceptable  to  such  institutions.    Each  notice  of 
redemption will state the date of such notice, the date of issue of the Bonds, the Series, the redemption date, 
the Redemption Price, the place or places of redemption (including the name and appropriate address of the 
Trustee), the CUSIP number (if any) of the maturity or maturities, and, if less than all of any such maturity is 
to be redeemed, the distinctive certificate numbers of the Series 2015 Bonds of such maturity, to be redeemed 
and, in the case of Series 2015 Bonds to be redeemed in part only, the respective portions of the principal 
amount thereof to be redeemed.  Each such notice will also state that on said date there will become due and 
payable on each of said Series 2015 Bonds the redemption price thereof, together with interest accrued thereon 
to the redemption date, and that from and after such redemption date interest thereon will cease to accrue, and 
will  require  that  such  Series  2015  Bonds  be then  surrendered  at  the  address of  the  Trustee  specified in the 
redemption notice.  Failure to receive such notice or any defect in such notice will not invalidate any of the 
proceedings taken in connection with such redemption. 

The Authority may, at its option, prior to the date fixed for redemption in any notice of redemption 
rescind  and  cancel  such  notice  of  redemption  by  Written  Request  to  the  Trustee  and  the  Trustee  will  mail 
notice of such cancellation to the recipients of the notice of redemption being cancelled. 

All Series 2015 Bonds redeemed pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement will be cancelled 
by the Trustee and destroyed with a certificate of destruction furnished to the Authority upon its request and 
will not be reissued. 

Effect of Notice of Redemption.  If notice of redemption has been duly given as aforesaid and money 
for the payment of the redemption price of the Series 2015 Bonds called for redemption is held by the Trustee, 

 

6 

 

then on the redemption date designated in such notice Series 2015 Bonds so called for redemption become due 
and payable, and from and after the date so designated interest on such Series 2015 Bonds cease to accrue, and 
the Bondholders of such Series 2015 Bonds will have no rights in respect thereof except to receive payment of 
the redemption price thereof. 

Book-Entry Only System 

General.  DTC will act as securities depository for the Series 2015 Bonds.  The Series 2015 Bonds 
will be issued as fully-registered bonds registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee).  
One fully-registered Series 2015 Bond will be issued for each maturity of the Series 2015 Bonds, each in the 
initial aggregate principal amount of such maturity, will be deposited with DTC and will be available to actual 
purchasers of the Series 2015 Bonds (the “Beneficial Owners”) in denominations of $5,000 or any integral 
multiple thereof.  Beneficial Owners will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Series 2015 Bonds.  
See Appendix E for further information with respect to DTC and its book-entry only system. 

Transfer and Exchange of Bonds.  The following provisions regarding the exchange and transfer of 
the Series 2015 Bonds apply only during any period in which the Series 2015 Bonds are not subject to DTC’s 
book-entry system.  While the Series 2015 Bonds are subject to DTC’s book-entry system, their exchange and 
transfer  will be  effected  through  DTC  and  the  Participants  and  will  be  subject  to  the  procedures,  rules and 
requirements established by DTC. 

Any Series 2015 Bond may, in accordance with its terms, be transferred in the books required to be 
kept pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement by the person in whose name it is registered, in person 
or by his duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of such Series 2015 Bond for cancellation accompanied by 
delivery of a duly executed written instrument of transfer in a form acceptable to the Trustee.  Whenever any 
Series  2015  Bond  or  Bonds  are  surrendered  for  transfer,  the  Authority  will  execute  and  the  Trustee  will 
authenticate and deliver to the transferee a new Series 2015 Bond or Bonds of the same Series and maturity for 
a like aggregate principal amount of Authorized Denominations.  The Trustee will require the payment by the 
Bondholder requesting such transfer of any tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect 
to such transfer as a condition precedent to the exercise of such privilege. 

The Authority and the Trustee may, except as otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement, deem and 
treat the registered owner of any Series 2015 Bond as the absolute owner of such Series 2015 Bond for the 
purpose of receiving payment thereof and for all other purposes, whether such Series 2015 Bond is overdue or 
not, and neither the Authority nor the Trustee will be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary; and 
payment of the interest on and principal of and redemption premium, if any, on such Series 2015 Bond will be 
made  only  to  such  registered  owner,  which  payments  will  be  valid  and  effectual  to  satisfy  and  discharge 
liability on such Series 2015 Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid. 

The Trustee is not required to register the transfer of or exchange any Series 2015 Bond which has 
been selected for redemption in whole or in part, from and after the day of mailing of a notice of redemption of 
such  Series  2015  Bond  selected  for  redemption  in  whole  or  in  part  as  provided  in  the  Trust  Agreement  or 
during the period established by the Trustee for selection of Series 2015 Bonds for redemption. 

Series  2015  Bonds  may  be  exchanged  at  the  Principal  Office  of  the  Trustee  for  a  like  aggregate 
principal amount of Series 2015 Bonds of the same Series and maturity of other authorized denominations.  
The  Trustee  will  require  the  payment  by  the  Bondholder  requesting  such  exchange  of  any  tax  or  other 
governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such exchange as a condition precedent to the exercise 
of such privilege.  The Trustee is not required to exchange any Series 2015 Bond which has been selected for 
redemption in whole or in part, from and after the day of mailing of a notice of redemption of such Series 2015 
Bond  selected  for  redemption  in  whole or  in  part  as provided  in  the  Trust  Agreement  or  during  the  period 
established by the Trustee for selection of Series 2015 Bonds for redemption.

SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES 2015 BONDS 

Pledge of Revenues 

The  Series  2015  Bonds  are  equally  and  ratably  payable  from  and  secured  by  the  Revenues,  which 
consist of: (i) the Base Rental Payments and other payments paid by the City and received by the Authority 
pursuant to the Facilities Sublease (but not including Additional Payments as described below); and (ii) all 
interest or other income from any investment of any money in any fund or account established pursuant to the 
Trust Agreement or the Facilities Sublease.   

Base  Rental  Payments  will  be  paid  by  the  City  from  any  and  all  legally  available  funds.    See  the 
captions  “THE  CITY,”  “CITY  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION”  and  “RISK  FACTORS.”    The  City  has 
covenanted  in  the  Facilities  Sublease  to  take  such  action  as  may  be  necessary  to  include  all  Base  Rental 
Payments  and  Additional  Payments  due  thereunder  in  its  annual  budgets,  and  to  make  necessary  annual 
appropriations for all such Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments, subject to abatement as described 
in this Official Statement. 

Revenues of the Electric Utility are not pledged as security for the Series 2015 Bonds.  However, net 
revenues of the Electric Utility (revenues remaining after payment of operation and maintenance costs thereof 
and  debt  service  obligations  with  respect  thereto)  are  available  to  pay  Base  Rental  Payments,  and  the  City 
currently  expects  to  pay  all  or  a  portion  of  Base  Rental  Payments  from  such  net  revenues  of  the  Electric 
Utility.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City makes no assurances regarding the amount of net revenues of 
the Electric Utility or the availability of net revenues of the Electric Utility to pay Base Rental Payments. 

The Authority may issue Additional Bonds payable from the Base Rental Payments on a parity with 

the Series 2015 Bonds.  See the caption “—Additional Bonds.” 

All Revenues, any other amounts (including proceeds of the sale of the Series 2015 Bonds) held by 
the Trustee in any fund or account established under the Trust Agreement and any other amounts (excluding 
Additional Payments) received by the Authority in respect of the Property have been irrevocably pledged to 
the payment of the interest and premium, if any, on and principal of the Series 2015 Bonds as provided in the 
Trust  Agreement,  and  the  Revenues  and  other  amounts  pledged  thereunder  may  not  be  used  for  any  other 
purpose while any of the Bonds remain Outstanding; provided, however, that out of the Revenues and other 
moneys  there  may  be  applied  such  sums  for  such  purposes  as  are  permitted  thereunder.    Such  pledges 
constitutes a pledge of and charge and first lien upon the Revenues, all other amounts pledged under the Trust 
Agreement and all other moneys on deposit in the funds and accounts established thereunder for the payment 
of the interest on and principal of the Series 2015 Bonds in accordance with the terms thereof.   

Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Authority has assigned its right, title and interest in the Base 
Rental Payments and its right to enforce remedies under the Facilities Sublease to the Trustee as security for 
the payment of the Series 2015 Bonds.  The City will pay Base Rental Payments directly to the Trustee, as 
assignee of the Authority.  See the caption “—Base Rental Payments” below.   

THE  SERIES  2015  BONDS  ARE  LIMITED  OBLIGATIONS  OF  THE  AUTHORITY  AND  ARE 
PAYABLE, AS TO INTEREST THEREON, PRINCIPAL THEREOF AND ANY PREMIUMS UPON THE 
REDEMPTION  OF  ANY  THEREOF,  SOLELY  FROM  THE  REVENUES  DESCRIBED  HEREIN,  AND 
THE AUTHORITY IS NOT OBLIGATED TO PAY THEM EXCEPT FROM THE REVENUES.  ALL OF 
THE SERIES 2015 BONDS ARE EQUALLY SECURED BY A PLEDGE OF AND CHARGE AND LIEN 
UPON THE REVENUES, AND THE REVENUES CONSTITUTE A TRUST FUND FOR THE SECURITY 
AND  PAYMENT  OF  THE  INTEREST  ON  AND  PRINCIPAL  OF  AND  REDEMPTION  PREMIUMS,  IF 
ANY, ON THE SERIES 2015 BONDS AS PROVIDED HEREIN.   

 

8 

 

THE SERIES 2015 BONDS ARE NOT A DEBT OF THE CITY, THE STATE OR ANY OF ITS 
POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, AND NEITHER THE CITY, THE STATE NOR ANY OF ITS POLITICAL 
SUBDIVISIONS IS LIABLE THEREON, NOR IN ANY EVENT SHALL THE SERIES 2015 BONDS BE 
PAYABLE OUT OF ANY FUNDS OR PROPERTIES OTHER THAN THOSE OF THE AUTHORITY AS 
DESCRIBED  HEREIN.    THE  SERIES  2015  BONDS  DO  NOT  CONSTITUTE  AN  INDEBTEDNESS 
WITHIN  THE  MEANING  OF  ANY  CONSTITUTIONAL  OR  STATUTORY  LIMITATION  OR 
RESTRICTION.

Base Rental Payments, will be paid by the City to the Authority for and in consideration of the right to 
use and occupy the Property and in consideration of the continued right to the quiet use and enjoyment thereof 
during each Rental Payment Period for which such Base Rental Payments are to be paid.  The Base Rental 
Payments are due and payable on October 25 and April 25 in the amounts set forth in the Facilities Sublease 
and are for the use and occupancy of the Property during the one-year period ending on the 1st day of each 
November.  All Base Rental Payments received by the Trustee will be deposited by the Trustee in the Revenue 
Fund established under the Trust Agreement. 

Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, all money in the Revenue Fund will be set aside by the Trustee in 
the following respective special accounts or funds within the Revenue Fund (each of which has been created 
and each of which the Authority has covenanted and agreed to cause to be maintained) in the following order 
of priority: (1) Interest Account; and (2) Principal Account. 

All money in each of such accounts will be held in trust by the Trustee and will be applied, used and 
withdrawn  only  for  the  purposes  authorized  in  the  Trust  Agreement.    On  each  Principal  Payment  Date, 
following payment of principal of and interest on the Series 2015 Bonds, any excess amount on deposit in the 
Revenue Fund will be returned to the City as an excess of Base Rental Payments. 

Interest  Account.    On  or  before  each  Interest  Payment  Date,  the  Trustee  will  set  aside  from  the 
Revenue  Fund  and  deposit  in  the  Interest  Account  that  amount  of  money  which  is  equal  to  the  amount  of 
interest becoming due and payable on all Outstanding Bonds on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.  
No deposit need be made in the Interest Account if the amount contained therein and available to pay interest 
on the Bonds is at least equal to the aggregate amount of interest becoming due and payable on all Outstanding 
Bonds on such Interest Payment Date.  All money in the Interest Account will be used and withdrawn by the 
Trustee solely for the purpose of paying the interest on the Series 2015 Bonds as it becomes due and payable 
(including accrued interest on any Series 2015 Bonds purchased or redeemed prior to maturity). 

Principal Account.  On or before each November 1, the Trustee will set aside from the Revenue Fund 
and deposit in the Principal Account an amount of money equal to the amount of all sinking fund payments 
required to be made on such November 1, into the respective sinking fund accounts for all Outstanding Term 
Bonds and the principal amount of all Outstanding Serial Bonds maturing on such November 1.  No deposit 
need be made in the Principal Account if the amount contained therein and available to pay principal of the 
Series 2015 Bonds is at least equal to the aggregate amount of the principal of all Outstanding Serial Bonds 
maturing by their terms on such November 1 plus the aggregate amount of all sinking fund payments required 
to be made on such November 1 for all Outstanding Term Bonds.  All money in the Principal Account will be 
used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of paying the principal of the Series 2015 Bonds as it 
becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or redemption, except that any money in any Sinking Account 
created under the Trust Agreement will be used and withdrawn by the Trustee only to purchase or to redeem or 
to pay Term Bonds for which such Sinking Account was created. 

Scheduled  Base  Rental  Payments  relating  to  the  Series  2015  Bonds  are  set  forth  below  under  the 

caption “BASE RENTAL PAYMENT SCHEDULE.”

Additional Payments 

For  the  right  to  use  and  occupy  the  Property,  the  Facilities  Sublease  requires  the  City  to  pay,  as 
Additional Payments thereunder, in addition to the Base Rental Payments, such amounts as are required for the 
payment  all  amounts,  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by  the  Authority  in  connection  with  the  execution, 
performance or enforcement of the Facilities Sublease or any assignment thereof, the Trust Agreement, the 
Authority’s  interest  in  the  Property  and  the  lease  of  the  Property  to  the  City,  including  but  not  limited  to 
payment of all fees, costs and expenses and all administrative costs of the Authority related to the Series 2015 
Bonds,  the  Property,  including,  without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  salaries  and  wages  of 
employees, all expenses, compensation and indemnification payable by the Authority to the Trustee under the 
Trust Agreement, other amounts due and owing AGM as set forth in the Facilities Sublease, fees of auditors, 
accountants, attorneys or architects, and all other necessary administrative costs of the Authority or charges 
required to be paid by it in order to maintain its existence or to comply with the terms of the Series 2015 Bonds 
or  of  the  Trust  Agreement;  but  not  including  in  such  Additional  Payments  amounts  required  to  pay  the 
principal of or interest on the Series 2015 Bonds. 

Such Additional Payments will be billed to the City by the Authority or the Trustee from time to time, 
together with a statement certifying that the amount billed has been paid by the Authority or by the Trustee on 
behalf of the Authority, for one or more of the items above described, or that such amount is then payable by 
the Authority or the Trustee for such items.  Amounts so billed will be paid by the City within 60 days after 
receipt of the bill by the City.  The City reserves the right to audit billings for Additional Payments although 
exercise  of  such  right  will  in  no  way  affect  the  duty  of  the  City  to  make  full  and  timely  payment  for  all 
Additional Payments. 

The  Authority  may  in  the  future  issue  bonds  to  finance  facilities,  and  may  in  the  future  enter  into 
leases with respect to other facilities.  The administrative costs of the Authority will be allocated among such 
other facilities and the Property as provided below.  The fees of the Trustee under the Trust Agreement, and 
any other expenses directly attributable to the Property will be included in the Additional Payments payable 
under the Facilities Sublease.  The fees of any trustee or paying agent under any indenture securing bonds of 
the  Authority  or  any  trust  agreement  other  than  the  Trust  Agreement,  and  any  other  expenses  directly 
attributable  to  any  facilities  other  than  the  Property,  will  not  be  included  in  the  administrative  costs  of  the 
Property,  and  will  not  be  paid  from  the  Additional  Payments  payable  under  the  Facilities  Sublease.    Any 
expenses of the Authority not directly attributable to any particular project of the Authority will be equitably 
allocated among all such projects, including the Property in accordance with sound accounting practice.  In the 
event of any question or dispute as to such allocation, the written opinion of an independent firm of certified 
public accountants, employed by the Authority to consider the question and render an opinion thereon, will be 
a  final  and  conclusive  determination  as  to  such  allocation.    The  Trustee  may  conclusively  rely  upon  the 
Written  Request  of  the  Authority,  with  the  approval  of  the  Mayor,  Vice-Mayor,  City  Manager  or  Finance 
Director of the City or any such officer’s duly authorized designee, or a duly authorized representative of the 
City,  endorsed  thereon,  in  making  any  determination  that  costs  relating  to  the  Authority  are  payable  as 
Additional Payments under the Facilities Sublease, and is not required to make any investigation as to whether 
or not the items so requested to be paid are expenses of operation of the Property. 

Abatement 

The Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments will be abated proportionately, during any period 
in which by reason of any material damage or destruction (other than by condemnation, which is provided for 
in the Facilities Sublease) there is substantial interference with the use and occupancy of the Property by the 
City, in the proportion in which the cost of that portion of the Property rendered unusable bears to the cost of 
the whole of the Property.  Such abatement will continue for the period commencing with such damage or 
destruction and ending with the substantial completion of the work of repair or reconstruction.  In the event of 
any  such  damage  or  destruction,  the  Facilities  Sublease  will  continue  in  full  force  and  effect  and  the  City 
waives the benefits of California Civil Code Sections 1932(2) and 1933(4) and of Title 11 of the United States 

 

10 

 

Code, Section 365(h) and any and all other rights to terminate the Facilities Sublease by virtue of any such 
damage or destruction or interference. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that moneys are available for the payment of Base Rental 
Payments and Additional Payments in any of the funds and accounts established under the Trust Agreement 
(including as a result of the availability of insurance proceeds), such Base Rental Payments and Additional 
Payments will not be abated as provided above but, rather, will be payable by the City as a special obligation 
payable solely from said funds and accounts.  See the caption “—Insurance” and Appendix A. 

Substitution, Addition and Removal of Property 

The  City  and  the  Authority  may  add,  substitute  or  release  real  property  for  all  or  part  of,  or  may 
release a part of, the Property for purposes of the Facilities Lease and the Facilities Sublease, but only with the 
consent of AGM and after the City has filed with the Authority and the Trustee, with copies to each rating 
agency then providing a rating for the Bonds, all of the following: 

(i) 

Executed  copies  of  the  Facilities  Lease  and  the  Facilities  Sublease  or  amendments  thereto 
containing  the  amended  description  of  the  Property,  including  the  legal  description  of  any  real  property 
component of the Property as modified, if necessary. 

(ii) 

A Written Certificate of the City, certifying that the annual fair rental value (which may be 
based on, but not limited to, the construction or acquisition cost or replacement cost of such facility to the 
City) of the Property that will constitute the Property after such addition, substitution or withdrawal will be at 
least equal to 100% of the maximum amount of Base Rental Payments becoming due in the then current Fiscal 
Year or in any subsequent Fiscal Year.  At the sole discretion of the City, in the alternative, in the event of a 
substitution only, the Written Certificate of the City will certify that the annual fair rental value of the new 
Property is at least equal to that of the substituted Property. 

(iii)  With  respect  to  an  addition  or  substitution  of  property,  a  leasehold  owner’s  title  insurance 
policy or policies or a commitment for such policy or policies or an amendment or endorsement to an existing 
title insurance policy or policies resulting in title insurance with respect to the Property after such addition or 
substitution in an amount at least equal to the aggregate principal amount of Bonds Outstanding; each such 
insurance instrument, when issued, will name the Trustee as the insured, and insure the leasehold estate of the 
Authority in such property subject only to such exceptions as do not substantially interfere with the City’s right 
to use and occupy such property and as will not result in an abatement of Base Rental Payments payable by the 
City under the Facilities Sublease. 

(iv) 

A  Written  Certificate  of  the  City  stating  that  such  addition,  substitution  or  withdrawal,  as 

applicable, does not adversely affect the City’s use and occupancy of the Property. 

(v) 

With respect to the substitution of property, a Written Certificate of the City stating that the 

useful life of the property to be substituted is at least equal to the useful life of the property being released. 

(vi) 

An opinion of Bond Counsel stating that any amendment executed in connection with such 
addition,  substitution  or  withdrawal,  as  the  case  may  be:  (i)  is  authorized  or  permitted  under  the  Facilities 
Sublease; (ii) will, upon the execution and delivery thereof, be valid and binding upon the Authority and the 
City; and (iii) will not cause the interest on any tax-exempt Bonds to be included in gross income for federal 
income tax purposes. 

The  City  and  the  Authority  have  agreed  that  the  Property  or  portion  thereof  for  which  other  real 
property is substituted, pursuant to the Facilities Sublease, will be released from the Facilities Lease and the 
Facilities Sublease, and will no longer be encumbered thereby and hereby or by the Trust Agreement at such 
time as the City has caused said substitution. 

 

11 

 

Any sale, substitution, release, transfer, lease, assignment, mortgage or encumbrance with respect to 
the Property under the Facilities Sublease or Facilities Lease will be subject to the prior written consent of 
AGM. 

Additional Bonds 

Conditions for the Issuance of Additional Bonds.  The Authority may at any time, issue Additional 
Bonds  pursuant  to  a  Supplemental  Trust  Agreement,  payable  from  the  Revenues  as  provided  in  the  Trust 
Agreement and secured by a pledge of and charge and lien upon the Revenues as provided therein equal to the 
pledge, charge and lien securing the Outstanding Series 2015 Bonds theretofore issued thereunder, but only 
subject to the following specific conditions, which have been made conditions precedent to the issuance of any 
such Additional Bonds: 

(a) 

The  Authority  is  in  compliance  with  all  agreements  and  covenants  contained  in  the  Trust 

Agreement and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

(b) 

The Supplemental Trust Agreement requires that the proceeds of the sale of such Additional 
Bonds will be applied to finance or refinance Projects, or for the refunding or repayment of any Bonds then 
Outstanding, including the payment of costs and expenses of and incident to the authorization and sale of such 
Additional Bonds.  The Supplemental Trust Agreement may also provide that a portion of such proceeds be 
applied to the payment of the interest due or to become due on said Additional Bonds. 

(c) 

The aggregate principal amount of Bonds issued and at any time Outstanding under the Trust 
Agreement does not exceed any limit imposed by law, by the Trust Agreement or by any Supplemental Trust 
Agreement. 

(d) 

The  Facilities  Sublease  has  been  amended,  if  necessary,  so  that  the  Base  Rental  Payments 
payable by the City thereunder in each Fiscal Year at least equal Debt Service, including Debt Service on the 
Additional Bonds, in each Fiscal Year, and if Base Rental Payments are being increased, a Certificate of the 
City will be delivered to the Trustee certifying that the annual fair rental value (which may be based on, but not 
limited to, the construction or acquisition cost or replacement cost of any facility which is or will become part 
of the Property) will be at least equal to 100% of the maximum amount of Base Rental Payments becoming 
due in the then current fiscal year or in any subsequent fiscal year. 

(e) 

If additional facilities, if any, are to be leased and are not situated on property described in the 
Facilities  Lease  and  Facilities  Sublease:  (1)  the  Facilities  Lease  has  been  amended  so  as  to  lease  to  the 
Authority such additional real property; and (2) the Facilities Sublease has been amended so as to lease to the 
City such additional real property. 

(f) 

The Reserve Fund is fully funded at the Reserve Fund Requirement (including the proposed 

issue) upon the issuance of such Additional Bonds, in either case unless otherwise permitted by AGM. 

Proceedings for Authorization of Additional Bonds.  Whenever the Authority and the City determine 
to execute and deliver any Additional Bonds pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Authority and the Trustee 
will  enter  into  a  Supplemental  Trust  Agreement  providing  for  the  issuance  of  such  Additional  Bonds, 
specifying the maximum principal amount of such Additional Bonds and prescribing the terms and conditions 
of such Additional Bonds. 

The Supplemental Trust Agreement will prescribe the form or forms of such Additional Bonds and, 
subject to the provisions of the Trust Agreement, will provide for the distinctive designation, denominations, 
method of numbering, dates, payment dates, interest rates, interest payment dates, provisions for redemption (if 
desired) and places of payment of principal and interest. 

 

12 

 

Before such Additional Bonds are issued, the City and the Authority will file or cause to be filed the 

following documents with the Trustee: 

(a) 

An Opinion of Counsel setting forth that: (1) such Counsel has examined the Supplemental 
Trust  Agreement  and  the  amendment  to  the  Facilities  Sublease  and  Facilities  Lease  required  by  the  Trust 
Agreement; (2) the execution and delivery of the Additional Bonds have been duly authorized by the City and 
the Authority; and (3) said amendment to the Facilities Sublease and Facilities Lease, when duly executed by 
the City and the Authority, will be valid and binding obligations of the City and the Authority. 

(b) 

A Certificate of the Authority stating that the requirements of the Trust Agreement have been 

(c) 

A Certificate of the City stating that the insurance required by the Facilities Sublease is in

effect. 

Upon  the  delivery  to  the  Trustee  of  the  foregoing  instruments  and  upon  the  Trustee’s  receipt  of 
Certificates of the City and of the Authority stating that all applicable provisions of the Trust Agreement have 
been complied with (so as to permit the execution and delivery of the Additional Bonds in accordance with the 
Supplemental Trust Agreement then delivered to the Trustee), the Trustee will authenticate and deliver said 
Additional Bonds in the aggregate principal amount specified in such Supplemental Trust Agreement to, or 
upon the Written Request of, the Authority. 

 The City has no current plans to issue Additional Bonds under the Trust Agreement.  See the caption 

“RISK FACTORS—Substitution, Addition and Removal of Property; Additional Bonds.” 

Action on Default 

Should  the  City  default  under  the  Facilities  Sublease,  the  Trustee,  as  assignee  of  the  Authority 
thereunder, may terminate the Facilities Sublease and recover certain damages from the City, or may retain the 
Facilities Sublease and hold the City liable for all Base Rental Payments thereunder on an annual basis, and the 
Trustee has the right to re-enter and re-let the Property.  In the event that such re-letting occurs, the City would 
be liable for any resulting deficiency in Base Rental Payments.  Base Rental Payments may not be accelerated 
upon  a  default  under  the  Facilities  Sublease.    See  the  caption  “RISK  FACTORS—Limited  Recourse  on 
Default; No Acceleration of Base Rental.” 

For  purposes  of  certain  actions  of  Bond  Owners  under  the  Trust  Agreement  and  the  Facilities 
Sublease,  such  as  certain  consents and  amendments  and  the  direction  of  remedies  following  default,  Series 
2015 Bond Owners do not act alone and may not control such matters to the extent that such matters are not 
supported by the requisite number of the Owners of all Series 2015 Bonds and Additional Bonds, if any. 

For a description of the events of default and permitted remedies of the Trustee (as assignee of the 

Authority) contained in the Facilities Sublease and the Trust Agreement, see Appendix A. 

Subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Trust  Agreement,  so  long  as  AGM  has  not  defaulted  under  the  Policy, 
AGM has the right to control all remedies for default under the Facilities Lease, the Facilities Sublease and the 
Trust Agreement. 

Reserve Fund 

Establishment of Reserve Fund.  The Trustee will establish and maintain a separate fund to be known 
as the “Reserve Fund.”  Moneys in the Reserve Fund will be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the 
purposes set forth in the Trust Agreement.  There will be deposited in the Reserve Fund the Reserve Policy 
pursuant to the Trust Agreement for the benefit of the Series 2015 Bonds.  The City, upon notice to the rating 

 

13 

 

agencies then rating the Series 2015 Bonds, reserves the right to substitute, at any time and from time to time, 
one or more Reserve Facilities from a financial institution, the long-term unsecured obligations of which are 
rated in the two highest rating categories of the rating agency in substitution for or in place of all or any portion 
of the Reserve Policy or the moneys, if any, on deposit in the Reserve Fund, which satisfy the Reserve Fund 
Requirement (as such term is defined below), under the terms of which the Trustee is unconditionally entitled 
to draw amounts when required for the purposes of the Trust Agreement.  Upon deposit by the City with the 
Trustee of any such Reserve Facility(ies), the Trustee will, on or after the date of such deposit, transfer to the 
City such amounts as are on deposit in the Reserve Fund in excess of the Reserve Fund Requirement after 
application of the Reserve Facility(ies) thereto.  The City will, subject to any investment instructions contained 
in the Tax Certificate and Agreement, if any, use any such amounts transferred from the Reserve Fund for any 
lawful purpose of the City which will not adversely affect any current or past exclusion from gross income for 
federal income tax purposes of the interest on the Bonds, if and to the extent such interest is currently or has in 
the past been so excluded.  Any amounts paid pursuant to any Reserve Facility will be deposited in the Reserve 
Fund.  The moneys in the Reserve Fund and any Reserve Facility shall be held in trust by the Trustee and shall 
be used and disbursed only for the purposes and uses herein authorized.  

The  term  “Reserve  Fund  Requirement”  means,  with  respect  to  the  Bonds,  an  amount  equal  to  an 
amount  equal  to  the  least  of:  (i)  maximum  prospective  annual  Base  Rental  Payments  with  respect  to 
Outstanding  Bonds  to  be  made  by  the  City  under  the  Facilities  Sublease;  (ii)  10%  of  the  proceeds  of  the 
Bonds; or (iii) 125% of the average annual Base Rental Payments with respect to Outstanding Bonds to be 
made by the City under the Facilities Sublease.   

Application of Reserve Fund.  Amounts on deposit in the Reserve Fund which were not derived from 
payments under any Reserve Facility credited to the Reserve Fund to satisfy a portion of the Reserve Fund 
Requirement may be used and withdrawn by the Trustee prior to using and withdrawing any amounts derived 
from  payments  under  any  such  Reserve  Facility.    In  order  to  accomplish  such  use  and  withdrawal  of  such 
amounts not derived from payments under any such Reserve Facility, the Trustee will, as and to the extent 
necessary, liquidate any investments purchased with such amounts.  If and to the extent that, more than one 
Reserve  Facility  is  credited  to  the  Reserve  Fund  to  satisfy  a  portion  of  the  Reserve  Fund  Requirement, 
drawings  thereunder,  and  repayment  of  expenses  with  respect  thereto,  will  be  made  on  a  pro-rata  basis 
(calculated by reference to the policy limits available thereunder). 

If, on any Interest Payment Date, the amount on deposit in any account within the Interest Account is 
insufficient to pay the interest due with respect to the corresponding Series of Bonds on such Interest Payment 
Date, the Trustee will transfer from the corresponding account within the Reserve Fund and deposit in such 
account within the Interest Account an amount sufficient to make up such deficiency.  If a Reserve Facility is 
credited to the Reserve Fund to satisfy a portion of the Reserve Fund Requirement, the Trustee will make a 
claim for payment under such Reserve Facility, in accordance with the provisions thereof, in an amount which, 
together  with  other  available  moneys  in  the  Reserve  Fund,  will  be  sufficient  to  make  said  deposit  in  the 
Interest Account. 

If, on any Principal Payment Date or any Mandatory Sinking Account Payment Date, the amount on 
deposit in any account within the Principal Account is insufficient to pay the principal due with respect to the 
corresponding Series of Bonds on such Principal Payment Date or Mandatory Sinking Account Payment Date, 
the Trustee will transfer from the corresponding account within the Reserve Fund and deposit in such account 
within the Principal Account an amount sufficient to make up such deficiency.  If a Reserve Facility is credited 
to the Reserve Fund to satisfy a portion of the Reserve Fund Requirement, the Trustee will make a claim for 
payment under such Reserve Facility, in accordance with the provisions thereof, in an amount which, together 
with  other  available  moneys  in  the  Reserve  Fund,  will  be  sufficient  to  make  said  deposit  in  the  Principal 
Account. 

In  the  event  of  any  withdrawal  or  transfer  from  the  Reserve  Fund,  the  Trustee  will,  within  5  days 
thereafter,  provide  written  notice  to  the  City  of  the  amount  and  the  date  of  such  transfer.    If  there  are  no 

 

14 

 

amounts currently due under any Reserve Facility and the sum of the amount on deposit in the Reserve Fund, 
plus the amount available under any Reserve Facilities, is reduced below the Reserve Fund Requirement, the 
first of Base Rental Payments thereafter received from the City under the Facilities Sublease and not needed to 
pay  the  interest  and  principal  of  the  Bonds  on  the  next  Interest  Payment  Date,  Principal  Payment  Date  or 
Mandatory  Sinking  Account  Payment  Date  will  be  used,  first,  to  reinstate  the  amounts  available  under  the 
Reserve Facilities that have been drawn upon and, second, to increase the amount on deposit in the Reserve 
Fund, so that the amount available under the Reserve Facilities, when added to the amount on deposit in the 
Reserve Fund, equals the Reserve Fund Requirement.  In the event there are insufficient funds to remedy any 
deficiencies in all such accounts, moneys shall be deposited pro rata in each such account.   

If at any time the balance in any account within the Reserve Fund is in excess of the Reserve Fund 
Requirement for such fund, the Trustee will transfer such excess to any other account within the Reserve Fund 
with  a  balance  less  than  the  Reserve  Fund  Requirement  for  such  fund  to  make  up  such  deficiency,  and 
thereafter to the Revenue Fund.   

At the termination of the Facilities Sublease in accordance with its terms, any balance remaining in the 
Reserve Fund will be released and may be transferred to such other fund or account of the City, or otherwise 
used  by  the  City  for  any  other  lawful  purposes,  as  the  City  may  direct.    For  purposes  of  determining  the 
amount on deposit in the Reserve Fund, all investments will annually be valued at the cost thereof (exclusive 
of  accrued  but  unpaid  interest,  but  inclusive  of  commissions).    Except  as  provided  in  the  Trust  Agreement 
from  Base  Rental  Payments  not  needed  to  pay  the  interest  and  principal  of  the  Bonds,  the  City  has  no 
obligation to replenish the Reserve Fund. 

Insurance 

The  Facilities  Sublease  requires  the  City  to  maintain  or  cause  to  be  maintained  fire,  lightning  and 
special extended coverage insurance (which includes coverage for vandalism and malicious mischief, but need 
not include coverage for earthquake damage) on all improvements constituting any part of the Property in an 
amount equal to the greater of 100% of the replacement cost of such improvements or 100% of the outstanding 
principal amount of the Bonds.  As an alternative to providing such insurance or any portion thereof, the City 
may provide a self-insurance method or plan of protection if and to the extent that such self-insurance method 
or plan of protection affords reasonable protection to the Authority, the Bond Holders and the Trustee, in light 
of  all  circumstances,  giving  consideration  to  cost,  availability  and  similar  plans  or  methods  of  protection 
adopted by public entities in the State other than the City. 

The  Facilities  Sublease  requires  the  City  to  maintain  rental  interruption  or  use  and  occupancy 
insurance to cover loss, total or partial, of the rental income from or the use of the Property as the result of any 
of the hazards covered by the insurance described in the preceding paragraph, in an amount sufficient to pay 
the maximum annual Base Rental Payments for any two year period, except that such insurance may be subject 
to a deductible clause of not to exceed $25,000.  Any proceeds of such insurance will be used by the Trustee to 
reimburse to the City any rental theretofore paid by the City under the Facilities Sublease attributable to such 
structure for a period of time during which the payment of rental under the Facilities Sublease is abated, and 
any proceeds of such insurance not so used will be applied as provided in the Facilities Sublease (to the extent 
required for the payment of Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments).  See the caption “—Abatement.” 

The Facilities Sublease requires the City to maintain or cause to be maintained, throughout the term 
thereof,  a  standard  commercial  general  liability  insurance  policy  or  policies  in  protection  of  the  City,  the 
Authority  and  their  respective  members,  officers,  agents  and  employees  and  the  Trustee,  with  minimum 
liability limits of $1,000,000 for personal injury or death of each person and $3,000,000 for personal injury or 
deaths of two or more persons in each accident or event, and in a minimum amount of $200,000 for damage to 
property resulting from each accident or event, and worker’s compensation insurance.

See  the  summary  of  the  Facilities  Sublease  set  forth  in  Appendix A  for  further  information  with 

respect to the insurance coverage required to be maintained by the City under the Facilities Sublease. 

A  description  of  insurance  coverages  maintained  by  the  City  is  set  forth  under  the  caption  “THE 

CITY—Risk Management.” 

The  Facilities  Sublease  also  requires  the  City  to  provide,  at  its  own  expense,  an  ALTA  leasehold 
owner’s title insurance policy or policies for the Property, in the aggregate amount of not less than the initial 
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds.  Such insurance instrument, when issued, will name the Trustee as 
the insured, and  will  insure  the leasehold  estate  of  the  Authority  subject  only  to such exceptions  as  do  not 
substantially  interfere  with  the  City’s  right  to  use  and  occupy  the  Property  and  as  will  not  result  in  an 
abatement of Base Rental Payments payable by the City under the Facilities Sublease. 

BOND INSURANCE 

The information under this caption has been prepared by AGM for inclusion in this Official Statement.  
None of the Authority, the City or the Underwriter has reviewed this information, nor do the Authority, the 
City or the Underwriter make any representation with respect to the accuracy or completeness thereof.  The 
following information is not a complete summary of the terms of the Policy (as such term is defined below) and 
reference is made to Appendix G for a specimen of the Policy. 

Bond Insurance Policy 

Concurrently  with  the  issuance  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds,  Assured  Guaranty  Municipal  Corp. 
(“AGM”) will issue its Municipal Bond Insurance Policy for the Series 2015 Bonds (the “Policy”).  The Policy 
guarantees the scheduled payment of principal of and interest on the Series 2015 Bonds when due as set forth 
in the form of the Policy included as Appendix G to this Official Statement. 

The Policy is not covered by any insurance security or guaranty fund established under New York, 

California, Connecticut or Florida insurance law. 

Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. 

AGM is a New York domiciled financial guaranty insurance company and an indirect subsidiary of 
Assured Guaranty Ltd. (“AGL”), a Bermuda-based holding company whose shares are publicly traded and are 
listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “AGO”.  AGL, through its operating subsidiaries, 
provides  credit  enhancement  products  to  the  U.S.  and  global  public  finance,  infrastructure  and  structured 
finance markets.  Neither AGL nor any of its shareholders or affiliates, other than AGM, is obligated to pay 
any debts of AGM or any claims under any insurance policy issued by AGM. 

AGM’s financial strength is rated “AA” (stable outlook) by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, a 
Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC business (“S&P”), “AA+” (stable outlook) by Kroll Bond Rating 
Agency, Inc. (“KBRA”) and “A2” (stable outlook) by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”).  Each 
rating of AGM should be evaluated independently.  An explanation of the significance of the above ratings 
may be obtained from the applicable rating agency.  The above ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or 
hold any security, and such ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, 
including withdrawal initiated at the request of AGM in its sole discretion.  In addition, the rating agencies 
may at any time change AGM’s long-term rating outlooks or place such ratings on a watch list for possible 
downgrade  in  the  near  term.    Any  downward  revision  or  withdrawal  of  any  of  the  above  ratings,  the 
assignment of a negative outlook to such ratings or the placement of such ratings on a negative watch list may 
have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  market  price  of  any  security  guaranteed  by  AGM.    AGM  only  guarantees 
scheduled principal and scheduled interest payments payable by the issuer of bonds insured by AGM on the 
date(s) when such amounts were initially scheduled to become due and payable (subject to and in accordance 

 

16 

 

with the terms of the relevant insurance policy), and does not guarantee the market price or liquidity of the 
securities it insures, nor does it guarantee that the ratings on such securities will not be revised or withdrawn. 

Current Financial Strength Ratings.  On June 29, 2015, S&P issued a credit rating report in which it 
affirmed AGM’s financial strength rating of “AA” (stable outlook).  AGM can give no assurance as to any 
further ratings action that S&P may take.   

On  November  13,  2014,  KBRA  assigned  an  insurance  financial  strength  rating  of  “AA+”  (stable 

outlook) to AGM.  AGM can give no assurance as to any further ratings action that KBRA may take. 

On July 2, 2014, Moody’s issued a rating action report stating that it had affirmed AGM’s insurance 
financial strength rating of “A2” (stable outlook).  On February 18, 2015, Moody’s published a credit opinion 
under its new financial guarantor ratings methodology maintaining its existing rating and outlook on AGM.  
AGM can give no assurance as to any further ratings action that Moody’s may take. 

For more information regarding AGM’s financial strength ratings and the risks relating thereto, see 

AGL’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.

A  portion  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds is  expected  to  be  used  to  finance  the  Project, 
which consists of the installation of a new electrical substation and associated feeders at an estimated cost of 
approximately $17,276,000.  Project costs that are not financed from a portion of the proceeds of the Series 
2015 Bonds will be funded from other available City moneys. 

In addition to the improvement projects listed above, there are many other capital improvements listed 
in the City’s adopted capital improvement program for Fiscal Year 2015 (which lists potential improvements 
having an estimated cost of approximately $57.8 million) that may be funded with Series 2015 Bond proceeds. 

The  City  expects  to  comply  with  all  governmental  approval,  public  bidding  and  other  permitting 
requirements for each component of the Project as required by law.  The City presently expects to substantially 
complete all components of the Project by Fiscal Year 2019.

THE PROPERTY 

The Property constitutes the subject matter of the Facilities Lease and the Facilities Sublease.  As of 
the date of issuance of the Series 2015 Bonds, the City holds title to the Property.  Upon the issuance of the 
Series 2015 Bonds, the City will lease the Property to the Authority pursuant to the Facilities Lease and the 
Authority  will  sublease  the  Property  back  to  the  City  pursuant  to  the  Facilities  Sublease.    Base  Rental 
Payments  under  the  Facilities  Sublease  secure  the  Series  2015  Bonds.    See  the  caption  “SECURITY  AND 
SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES 2015 BONDS—Base Rental Payments.” 

The Property consists of the City’s Conference and Recreation Center, which is located on Alessandro 
Boulevard, is an approximately 42,413 square foot municipal conference and banquet facility operated by the 
City.    The  Conference  and  Recreation  Center  includes  an  8,200  square  foot  ballroom,  the  Grand  Valley 
Ballroom.    The  Grand  Valley  Ballroom  can  accommodate  groups  of  up  to  400  people  and  includes  a  full 
kitchen, a reception patio, an outdoor banquet patio, a stage with two dressing rooms and a video and movie 
screen.    Other  facilities  at  the  Conference  and Recreation  Center  include  two  smaller  meeting rooms.    The 
Conference  and  Recreation  Center  hosts  private  events,  community  programs  and  public  meetings.    The 
facility also includes space for a childcare/daycare area, a gymnasium, two activity rooms and the office space 
for the City’s Parks and Community Services Department staff.  The Conference and Recreation Center was 
constructed in 2005 and comprises approximately 18.64 acres.  For purposes of the Facilities Sublease, the 
City has ascribed a value of approximately $13,874,000 to the Conference and Recreation Center. 

 

 

The City’s Parks and Community Services Department operates five facilities located at the various 
parks throughout the City, including Bethune Park, Woodland Park, the Conference and Recreation Center, a 
senior center, and two community centers, which facilities provide 79 youth programs, 88 senior programs and 
31  adult  programs  serving an  estimated 417,180  City  youths  and  adults  annually  for  baseball,  softball,  and 
soccer  play.    The  Parks  and  Community  Services  Department  also  hosts  activities  for  38  school  sites  and 
assists the City’s nonprofit sports organizations in hosting regional and national sports tournaments, resulting 
in a positive economic impact to City businesses.  The value that the City’s parks and recreation facilities bring 
to the local community has been repeatedly recognized.  The Press-Enterprise newspaper previously rated the 
City  “Number  One  in  Riverside  County  for  Family  Recreation.”    The  City  was  the  recipient  of  the  2005 
California Parks and Recreation Society Award for “Facility Design and Park Planning” for the Conference 
and Recreation Center, and in 1997 the City earned the Southern California Municipal Athletic Federation’s 
“Gold  Shield  Award”  for  providing  outstanding  leadership.    The  City  remains  committed  to  sustained 
community participation and use of facilities throughout the City’s park system. 

 

20 

 

In connection with the issuance of the Series 2015 Bonds, the City will certify that the annual fair 
rental  value  of  the  Property  is  at  least  equal  to  the  annual  Base  Rental  Payments.    The  City  makes  no 
assurances regarding the ability to relet any component of the Property or the amount of rental income to be 
received in the event that any component of the Property is relet. 

The table below summarizes certain attributes of the Property.  No portion of the Property is currently 

encumbered by debt obligations other than the Series 2015 Bonds.

Risk Management 

The City is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts, theft of, damage to, and destruction of 
assets,  errors  and  omissions,  injuries  to  employees  and  natural  disasters.    The  City  has  established  two 
self-insurance  funds  to  finance  uninsured  risks  of  loss  up  to  a  maximum  of  $300,000  for  each  workers’ 
compensation  claim  and  $250,000  for  each  general  liability  claim.    For  workers’  compensation,  the  City 
participates  in  the  CSAC  Excess  Insurance  Authority,  a  joint  powers  authority,  for  claims  in  excess  of 
coverage  provided  by  its  internal  funds  up  to  the  statutory  requirements.    For  general  liability,  the  City 
participates in the Public Entity Risk Management Authority (“PERMA”), a joint powers authority, for claims 
in excess of coverage provided by its internal funds up to $50,000,000.  Claims have not exceeded the City's 
insurance coverage in any of the last three years. 

The City purchases all-risk, replacement cost value property insurance coverage through PERMA up 
to a maximum amount of $100,000,000.  All property and improvements at the Property are insured under the 
City’s  property  insurance  coverage.    See  the  caption  “SECURITY  AND  SOURCES  OF  PAYMENT  FOR 
THE SERIES 2015 BONDS—Insurance.”  The City does not carry earthquake coverage. 

Accounting and Financial Reporting 

CITY FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

The  City  maintains  its  accounting  records  in  accordance  with  Generally  Accepted  Accounting 
Principles and the standards established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”).  On a 
quarterly basis, a report is prepared for the City Council and City staff which reviews fiscal performance to 
date  against  the  budget.    Combined  financial  statements  of  the  City  and  its  component  units  are  produced 
following the close of each Fiscal Year. 

The City Council employs an independent certified public accountant who examines at least annually 
the financial statements of the City in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including tests of 
the  accounting  records  and  other  auditing  procedures  as  such  accountant  considers  necessary.    As  soon  as 
practicable, after the end of the Fiscal Year, a final audit and report is submitted by the independent accountant 
to the City Council. 

 

24 

 

The accounts of the City are organized on the basis of funds and account groups, each of which is 
considered a separate accounting entity.  The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of 
self-balancing  accounts  that  comprise  its  assets,  liabilities,  fund  equity,  revenues  and  expenditures,  or 
expenses, as appropriate.  Government resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based 
upon the purposes for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled.   

The  General Fund  is the  general  operating  fund  of the  City.    It  is used  to  account  for  all  financial 
resources  except  those  required  to  be  accounted  for  in  another  fund.    It  is  expected  that  the  Base  Rental 
Payments  will  be  paid  for  from  amounts  in  the  General  Fund.    Tables 1  through  4  below  set  forth  certain 
historical  and  current  Fiscal  Year  budget  information  for  the  General  Fund.    Information  on  the  remaining 
governmental funds of the City as of June 30, 2014 is set forth in Appendix B. 

General Economic Condition and Outlook of the City 

As of June 30, 2014, the General Fund had a year-end surplus (revenues in excess of expenditures) of 
$7.7  million.    This  surplus  was  primarily  due  to  actual  revenues  exceeding  budgeted  revenues  and  actual 
expenditures being below budgeted expenditures, in each case by approximately $3.1 million.  In particular, 
actual  Fiscal  Year  2014  property  taxes,  the  General  Fund’s  fourth  largest  revenue  source,  increased  by 
approximately $1.2 million (10.6%) over the Fiscal Year 2014 budgeted amount.  

For Fiscal Year 2015, the amended General Fund operating budget projected revenues of $83,655,319, 
which  is  approximately  $2.6  million  (3.2%)  above  Fiscal  Year  2014  actual  revenues,  and  expenditures  of 
$79,996,304,  an  increase  of  approximately  $6.7  million  (9.2%)  over  Fiscal  Year  2014  actual  expenditures.  
The City projects that sales taxes and utility users taxes will continue to grow in Fiscal Year 2015, increasing 
by approximately 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively, over the Fiscal Year 2014 amount.   

See  the  caption  “—Budget  Procedure,  Current  Budget  and  Historical  Budget  Information”  for  a 

discussion of the adopted budget for Fiscal Year 2016. 

Budget Procedure, Current Budget and Historical Budget Information 

The City currently operates on a two-year operating budget cycle.  The current budget was approved 
on June 23, 2015 and will govern the period beginning on July 1, 2015 for Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017.  The 
budget includes all funding sources of the City, including the General Fund, Community Services District and 
the Successor Agency of the former Redevelopment Agency.  At such time as the City Manager determines, 
each  department  head  must  furnish  to  the  City  Manager  an  estimate  of  revenues  and  expenditures  for  the 
applicable department for the ensuing two Fiscal Years, detailed in such manner as may be prescribed by the 
City Manager.  In preparing the proposed budget, the City Manager reviews the estimates, holds conferences 
regarding the estimates with the respective department heads, and revises the estimates as the City Manager 
deems  advisable.    In  Fiscal  Year  2014,  the  City  Council  provided  direction  to  create  a  balanced  budget 
beginning with the Fiscal Year 2014 and 2015 budget cycle and for all future years. 

Prior to June 30 of every second Fiscal Year, the City Manager submits to the City Council a proposed 
budget for the two year period commencing the following July 1.  The budget includes proposed expenditures 
and the means of financing them.  Prior to June 30 of the applicable Fiscal Year, public hearings are conducted 
to obtain public comments and the budget is legally enacted through the passage of a resolution.  The budget is 
subject to amended throughout the two year period to reflect actual financial performance. 

From  the  effective  date  of  the  budget,  the  amounts  stated  as  proposed  expenditures  become 
appropriated to the several departments, offices and agencies for the objects and purposes named.  The City 
Manager is authorized to transfer budgeted amounts between line items within a department or activity, and 
between departments and programs within the same fund, provided that the total appropriation does not exceed 
the budgeted amount.  All other transfers or amendments require City Council approval.  The City Manager 

 

25 

 

and  affected  department  heads  are  mutually  responsible  for  controlling  expenditures  within  budgeted 
appropriations.  All appropriations lapse at the end of the Fiscal Year to the extent that they have not been 
expended or lawfully encumbered.  At a public meeting after the adoption of the budget the City Council may 
amend or supplement the budget by motion adopted by three affirmative votes of members of the City Council.  
Following the end of the first Fiscal Year of the two-year budget cycle, the City Manager proposes interim 
changes, if any, to the City Council in July of such Fiscal Year.   

A summary of the actions taken during the year-long budgetary process is set forth below:

The City conducts its annual financial audit between August and November each year, and such audit 
is typically approved by the City Council by December of such year.  In recognition of its financial reporting 
excellence,  the  Government  Finance  Officers  Association  of  the  United  States  and  Canada  has  awarded  a 
Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to the City for 16 consecutive years. 

The City Council adopted a balanced budget for Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017 on June 23, 2015.  The 
budget for all funds totals approximately $183,481,000 for Fiscal Year 2016 and $184,365,000 for Fiscal Year 
2017  and  the  General  Fund  operating  budget  totals  approximately  $91,885,401  for  Fiscal  Year  2016  and 
$95,429,178 for Fiscal Year 2017.  The Fiscal Year 2016 and 2017 General Fund operating budgets project an 
increase in revenues of approximately $6.8 million (8.6%) and $10.3 million (12.2%), respectively, over the 
Fiscal  Year  2015  amended  General  Fund  operating  budget.    Such  increases  are  derived  principally  from 
increases in property tax revenues resulting from increased assessed valuations, increases in sales tax revenues 
and increased development activity within the City. 

Based on unaudited actual Fiscal Year 2015 results, the City reports that the General Fund is on track 

to meet budgeted revenues and expenditures for Fiscal Year 2015. 

 

26 

 

Set  forth  in  Table 1  are  the  General  Fund  budgets  for  Fiscal  Years  2013,  2014  and  2015  and  the 
audited  General  Fund  results  for  Fiscal  Years  2013  and  2014.    During  the  course  of  each  Fiscal  Year,  the 
budget is amended and revised as necessary by the City Council.

Property Taxes 

Property  tax  receipts  of  $11,594,459  provided  the  fourth  largest  tax  revenue  source  of  the  City  in 
Fiscal Year 2015, contributing approximately 16.9% of General Fund tax revenues and approximately 13.8% 
of total General Fund revenues during Fiscal Year 2015.  Property in the State which is subject to ad valorem 
taxes  is  classified  as  “secured”  or  “unsecured.”    The  secured  classification  includes  property  on  which  any 
property tax levied by a county becomes a lien on that property.  A tax levied on unsecured property does not 
become a lien against the taxed unsecured property, but may become a lien on certain other property owned by 
the taxpayer.  Every tax which becomes a lien on secured property has priority over all other liens, arising 
pursuant  to  State  law,  on  the  secured  property,  regardless  of  the  time  of  the  creation  of  other  liens.    The 
valuation of property is determined as of January 1 each year, and installments of taxes levied upon secured 
property become delinquent on the following December 10th and April 10th of the subsequent calendar year.  
Taxes on unsecured property are due July 1 and become delinquent August 31. 

Secured  and  unsecured  properties  are  entered  separately  on  the  assessment  roll  maintained  by  the 
county assessor.  The method of collecting delinquent taxes is substantially different for the two classifications 
of property.  The exclusive means of forcing the payment of delinquent taxes with respect to property on the 
secured  roll  is  the  sale  of  the  property  securing  the  taxes  of  the  State  for  the  amount  of  taxes  that  are 
delinquent.  The taxing authority has four methods of collecting unsecured personal property taxes: (1) filing a 
civil action against the taxpayer; (2) filing a certificate in the office of the county clerk specifying certain facts 
in order to obtain a judgment lien on certain property of the taxpayer; (3) filing a certificate of delinquency for 
recording  in  the  county  recorder’s  office  in  order  to  obtain  a  lien  on  certain  property  of  the  taxpayer;  and 
(4) seizing  and  selling  personal  property,  improvements  or  possessory  interests  belonging  or  taxable  to  the 
assessee. 

A 10% penalty is added to delinquent taxes which have been levied with respect to property on the 
secured roll.  In addition, beginning on the July 1 following a delinquency, interest begins accruing at the rate 
of 1.5% per month on the amount delinquent.  Such property may thereafter be redeemed by the payment of 
the delinquent taxes and the 10% penalty, plus interest at the rate of 1.5% per month to the time of redemption.  
If taxes are unpaid for a period of five years or more, the property is deeded to the State and then is subject to 
sale  by  the  county  tax  collector.    A  10%  penalty  also  applies  to  the  delinquent  taxes  or  property  on  the 
unsecured  roll,  and  further,  an  additional  penalty  of  1.5%  per  month  accrues  with  respect  to  such  taxes 
beginning on the varying dates related to the tax billing date. 

Legislation  enacted  in  1984  (Section  25  et  seq.  of  the  California  Revenue  and  Taxation  Code), 
provides  for  the  supplemental  assignment  and  taxation  of  property  as  of  the  occurrence  of  a  change  in 
ownership or completion of new construction.  Previously, statutes enabled the assessment of such changes 
only as of the next tax lien date following the change and thus delayed the realization of increased property 
taxes from the new assessment for up to 14 months.  Collection of taxes based on supplemental assessments 
occurs throughout the year.  Taxes due are prorated according to the amount of time remaining in the tax year, 
with  the  exception  of  tax  bills  dated  January 1  through  May 31,  which  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the 
remainder of the current Fiscal Year and the full 12 months of the next Fiscal Year. 

For  a  number  of  years,  the  State  Legislature  has  shifted  property  taxes  from  cities,  counties  and 
special districts to the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (“ERAF”).  In Fiscal Years 1993 and 1994, in 
response to serious budgetary shortfalls, the State Legislature and administration permanently redirected over 
$3  billion  of  property  taxes  from  cities,  counties,  and  special  districts  to  schools  and  community  college 
districts pursuant to ERAF shifts.  The Fiscal Year 2005 State Budget included an additional $1.3 billion shift 
of property taxes from certain local agencies, including the City, in Fiscal Years 2005 and 2006. 

On November 2, 2004, State voters approved Proposition 1A, which amended the State Constitution 
to significantly reduce the State’s authority over major local government revenue sources.  Under Proposition 
1A, the State may not: (i) reduce local sales tax rates or alter the method of allocating the revenue generated by 

 

30 

 

such taxes; (ii) shift property taxes from local governments to schools or community colleges; (iii) change how 
property tax revenues are shared among local governments without two-thirds approval of both houses of the 
State  Legislature;  or  (iv) decrease  Vehicle  License  Fee  revenues  without  providing  local  governments  with 
equal  replacement  funding.    Beginning  in  Fiscal  Year  2009,  the  State  may  shift  to  schools  and  community 
colleges a limited amount of local government property tax revenue if certain conditions are met, including: 
(a) a proclamation by the Governor that the shift is needed due to a severe financial hardship of the State; and 
(b) approval of the shift by the State Legislature with a two-thirds vote of both houses.  Under such a shift, the 
State must repay local governments for their property tax losses, with interest, within three years.  Proposition 
1A does allow the State to approve voluntary exchanges of local sales tax and property tax revenues among 
local governments within a county.   

On July 27, 2009, the Governor signed a revised Fiscal Year 2010 State budget that included an ERAF 
shift of approximately 8% of 1% ad valorem property tax revenues from certain local agencies, including the 
City.  The City participated in the State of California Proposition 1A Receivables Program to securitize its 
receivable from the State, and, as a result, received the shifted funds in the amount of $1,307,713, without 
interest, in two installments in 2010 from the California Statewide Communities Development Authority.

Set forth in Table 5 are property tax collections and delinquencies in the City as of June 30 for Fiscal 
Years 2010 through 2014, the latest period for which such information is available.  Although the County has 
not formally adopted the Alternative Method of Distribution of Tax Levies and Collections and of Tax Sale 
Proceeds (known as the Teeter Plan), as provided for in Section 4701 et seq. of the Revenue and Taxation 
Code of the State, under a longstanding County policy, the County Auditor-Controller distributes 100% of tax 
increment  revenues  allocated  to  each  city  in  the  County  without  regard  to  delinquencies  in  the  payment  of 
property  taxes.    As  a  result  of  this  allocation  method,  the  City  receives  no  adjustments  for  redemption 
payments on delinquent collections.  The City does receive supplemental taxes.  There can be no assurance that 
the  County  Auditor-Controller  will  not  change  its  policies  with  respect  to  delinquencies  in  property  tax 
payments in the future.

Sales Taxes 

Sales tax receipts of $16,130,340 provided the second largest tax revenue source for the City in Fiscal 
Year 2015, contributing approximately 23.4% of General Fund tax revenues and approximately 19.2% of total 

 

32 

 

General Fund revenues during Fiscal Year 2015.  Automobile sales at the Moreno Valley Auto Mall and retail 
sales at the Moreno Valley Mall at Towngate contribute significantly to such receipts.   

A  sales  tax  is  imposed  on  retail  sales  or  consumption  of  personal  property  and  collected  and 
distributed by the State Board of Equalization.  The basic sales tax rate is established by the State Legislature, 
and local overrides may be approved by voters.  The current sales tax rate in the City is 8%. 

On  March 2, 2004, voters  approved  a  bond  initiative formally  known  as  the  “California  Economic 
Recovery  Act.”    This  act  authorized  the  issuance  of  $15  billion  of  Economic  Recovery  Bonds  to  finance 
ongoing State budget deficits, which are payable from a fund established by the redirection of tax revenues 
known as the “Triple Flip.”  The State issued $11.3 billion of Economic Recovery Bonds prior to June 30, 
2004.  Under the “Triple Flip,” one-quarter of local governments’ 1% share of the sales tax imposed on taxable 
transactions  within  their  jurisdiction  is  being  redirected  to  the  State.    In  an  effort  to  eliminate  the  adverse 
impact of the sales tax revenue redirection on local government, State legislation provides for certain property 
taxes to be redirected to local government.  Because these property tax moneys were previously earmarked for 
schools, the legislation provides for schools to receive other State general fund revenues.  It is expected that 
the swap of sales taxes for property taxes will terminate once the Economic Recovery Bonds are repaid, which 
is  currently  expected  to  occur  in  the  first  quarter  of  Fiscal  Year  2016.    See  the  caption  “STATE  OF 
CALIFORNIA BUDGET INFORMATION.” 

Additional information relating to sales tax receipts by the City is set forth in Appendix F. 

Utility Taxes 

Utility taxes of $16,138,202 provided the largest tax revenue source for the City in Fiscal Year 2015, 
contributing approximately 23.5% of General Fund tax revenues and approximately 19.2% of total General 
Fund revenues during Fiscal Year 2015.  The utility tax is imposed upon utility users in the City, including 
users of electricity, gas, telephone, mobile telephone and water services, at the rate of 5.75%.  Exemptions are 
available for low-income residents.  Proceeds of the utility tax are used to fund police, fire, library, school 
crossing guard, animal control, code enforcement and street maintenance programs and other activities funded 
by the General Fund.  

In July 2015, the City was made aware of an effort by a taxpayer advocacy group to place a measure 
on  the  ballot  to  repeal  the  City’s  utility  tax.    The  action  is  part  of  a  larger  Statewide  effort  affecting 
approximately 60 municipalities with similar utility taxes.  In order to place such a measure on the ballot, a 
petition must be signed by 10% (or approximately 7,600) of the registered voters in the City, and in order for 
the measure to be adopted, it must be approved by a  majority of citizens voting thereon.  There can be no 
assurance as to whether the requisite number of signatures will be gathered, or the timing thereof, nor can there 
be any assurance as to whether the measure will ultimately be adopted. 

Other Taxes 

Other  taxes  of  $9,750,622  collected  by  the  City  in  Fiscal  Year  2015,  including  but  not  limited  to 
transient  occupancy  taxes,  business  licenses,  franchise  fees  and  property  transfer  taxes,  provided 
approximately 14.2% of General Fund tax revenues and 11.6% of total General Fund revenues during Fiscal 
Year 2015. 

Services 

Fees of $9,449,482 collected for services provided by the City in Fiscal Year 2015, including but not 
limited  to  fees  for  plan  checks  and  other  planning  services,  issuance  of  building  permits,  police  services, 
paramedic services, public works projects and parks and recreation programs, provided approximately 11.2% 
of General Fund revenues during Fiscal Year 2015. 

 

33 

 

State of California Motor Vehicle In-Lieu Payments 

The State imposes a Vehicle License Fee (the “VLF”), which is the portion of the fees paid in lieu of 
personal property taxes on a vehicle.  The VLF is based on vehicle value and declines as the vehicle ages.  
Prior  to  the  adoption  of  the  Fiscal  Year  2005  State  Budget,  the  VLF  was  2%  of  the  value  of  a  vehicle.  
Through legislation in prior Fiscal Years, the State enacted VLF reductions under which the State was required 
to “backfill” local governments for their revenue losses resulting from the lowered fee.  The Fiscal Year 2005 
State  Budget  permanently  reduced  the  VLF  from  2%  to  0.65%  of  the  value  of  a  vehicle  and  deleted  the 
requirement for backfill payments, providing instead that the amount of the backfill requirement will be met by 
an increase in the property tax allocation to cities and counties.  See the caption “STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
BUDGET INFORMATION.” 

As  set  forth  in  Table  7  below,  for  Fiscal  Year  2015,  the  City  received  $15,137,754  in  total  VLF 

revenues, all of which was distributed from property tax receipts.

2007  Bonds.    In  2007,  the  Moreno  Valley  Public  Financing  Authority  (the  “Authority”) 
issued its 2007 Taxable Lease Revenue Bonds (the “2007 Bonds”) to finance certain capital improvements of 
the City and the Electric Utility.  The 2007 Bonds mature on May 1, 2038 and bear interest at rates varying 
from 5.084% to 5.75% per annum.  The 2007 Bonds are payable from rental payments payable from the City 
to the Authority under a Lease Agreement, dated as of April 1, 2007 (the “2007 Lease”), by and between the 
City and the Authority.  The leased assets under the 2007 Lease consist of an electrical substation and electric 
distribution  infrastructure  (including  conduit,  wiring,  meters,  capacitors,  transformers,  switches,  electrical 
meters, high and low voltage cable, streetlights, interconnection cabinets and other miscellaneous structures 
and improvements).  As of June 30, 2014, the 2007 Bonds were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount 
of $23,615,000. 

The City has covenanted in the 2007 Lease to budget and appropriate moneys annually for the lease 
payments  payable  thereunder  from  legally  available  funds,  including  the  General  Fund,  on  a  basis  that  is 
substantially similar to the Facilities Sublease in connection with the Series 2015 Bonds.   

2011  Private  Placement  Obligation  –  City  Hall  Refunding.    In  2011,  the  City  and  the 
Authority entered into a lease arrangement (the “2011 Private Placement Obligation – City Hall Refunding”) 
pursuant to which: (i) the City leased a corporate yard and a senior center to the Authority in exchange for a 
lump  sum  payment;  and  (ii)  the  Authority  subleased  such  property  back  to  the  City  in  exchange  for  lease 
payments payable through November 1, 2016.  Proceeds of the 2011 Private Placement Obligation – City Hall 
Refunding  were  applied  to  refund  certain  prior  obligations  of  the  City  entered  into  in  1997.    The  lease 
payments bear interest at the rate of 2.92%.  As of June 30, 2014, the 2011 Private Placement Obligation – 
City Hall Refunding was outstanding in the principal amount of $2,261,500.

Retirement Contributions 

This  caption  contains  certain  information  relating  to  the  California  Public  Employees  Retirement 
System  (“CalPERS”).   The  information  is  primarily  derived  from  information  produced  by  CalPERS,  its 
independent  accountants  and  actuaries.   The  City  and  the  Authority  have  not  independently  verified  the 
information provided by CalPERS and make no representations nor express any opinion as to the accuracy of 
the information provided by CalPERS.   

The  comprehensive  annual  financial  reports  of  CalPERS  are  available  on  its  Internet  website  at 
www.calpers.ca.gov.  The CalPERS website also contains CalPERS’ most recent actuarial valuation reports 
and  other  information  concerning  benefits  and  other  matters.   Such  information  is  not  incorporated  by 
reference  herein.   Neither 
the  accuracy  of  such 
information.  Actuarial assessments are forward-looking statements that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries 
of the pension plans, and are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may not materialize 
or be changed in the future.  Actuarial assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

Summary of Plans.  The City contributes to CalPERS, an agent multiple-employer public employee 
defined  benefit  pension  plan,  on  behalf  of  331  total  City  employees  who  participate  in  the  City’s 
Miscellaneous  Plan.    CalPERS  provides  retirement,  disability  and  death  benefits  to  plan  members  and 
beneficiaries.  CalPERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities 
within the State, including the City. 

Required  employer  and  employee  contributions  are  determined  from  rates  established  by  CalPERS 
based upon various actuarial assumptions which are revised annually.  The City currently funds the normal 
pension costs, which are determined by CalPERS using the Entry Age Normal Actuarial Cost Method, as well 
as  an  amortization  of  the  City’s  unfunded  actuarial  liability.    For  Fiscal  Years  2014  and  2015,  the  City’s 
contributions  to  the  CalPERS  plan  were  $4,267,872  and  $4,638,567  (estimated),  respectively,  which  were 
equal to the respective annual required contributions (each, an “ARC”) of the City.  The contribution rates for 
Fiscal Year 2016 have been established at 24.859% of annual covered payroll.  

Participants in the City’s CalPERS plan are required to contribute 8% of their annual covered salary 
for  employee  member  contributions.    The  City  pays  the  employee  member  contributions  required  of 
Miscellaneous Plan participants hired prior to July 1, 2009 on their behalf and for their account.  The City does 
not pay any portion of the contributions required of Miscellaneous Plan participants hired on or after July 1, 
2009  on  their  behalf;  such  employees  are  required  to  make  100%  of  their  required  Miscellaneous  Plan 
contribution  of:  (i)  8%  (for  employees  hired  between  July  1,  2009  and  December  22,  2011);  (ii)  7%  (for 
employees hired between December 23, 2011 and December 31, 2012); or (iii) 6.25% (for employees hired on 
or after January 1, 2013).  

Employees hired on or after January 1, 2013 who meet the definition of a “New CalPERS Member” 
are subject to the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (“AB 340”), which was signed by 
the State Governor on September 12, 2012.  AB 340 established a new pension tier (2% at 62 formula) with a 
maximum  benefit  formula  of  2.5%  at  age  67.    Benefits  for  such  participants  are  calculated  on  the  highest 
average annual compensation over a consecutive 36 month period.  Employees are required to pay at least 50% 
of  the  total  normal  cost  rate.    Such  participants  are  currently  required  to  contribute  6.25%  of  their  annual 
covered salary under the CalPERS plan.  The City does not pay any portion of such contributions.  See the 
caption “—AB 340” below. 

The City had an unfunded accrued liability of $52,992,224 for its CalPERS plan as of June 30, 2013 
based on a market value of assets of $97,111,799, as set forth in the most recent actuarial report prepared by 
CalPERS, and an estimated unfunded accrued liability of $54,279,911 for the Miscellaneous Plan for Fiscal 
Year 2014.

Under GASB Statement No. 27, an employer reports an annual pension cost equal to the ARC plus an 
adjustment  for  the  cumulative  difference  between  the  annual  pension  cost  and  the  employer’s  actual  plan 
contributions for the year.  The cumulative difference is called the net pension obligation and may be positive 
or negative.  The ARC for Fiscal Year 2014 was determined by an actuarial valuation of the plan as of June 30, 
2012 and the ARC for Fiscal Year 2015 has been determined by an actuarial valuation of the plan as of June 
30, 2013. 

The following table summarizes the City’s annual required contributions for its CalPERS plan for the

CalPERS reported significant investment losses in 2009.  CalPERS earnings reports for Fiscal Years 
2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 reported an investment gain of 13.0%, 21.7%, 1%, 12.5%, 18.4% and 
2.4%, respectively.  Future earnings performance may increase or decrease future contribution rates for plan 
participants, including the City.  The CalPERS pension trust pays all retiree benefit payments associated with 
the City’s plan.   

Actuarial  Methods.    The  staff  actuaries  at  CalPERS  annually  prepare  an  actuarial  valuation  which 
covers  a  Fiscal  Year  ending  approximately  15  months  before  the  actuarial  valuation  is  delivered  (thus,  the 
actuarial valuations delivered to the City in October 2014 covered the City’s Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2013).  
The actuarial valuations express the City’s required contribution rates in percentages of covered payroll, which 
percentages the City must contribute in the Fiscal Year immediately following the Fiscal Year in which the 
actuarial valuation is prepared (thus, the City’s contribution rate derived from the actuarial valuation as of June 
30, 2012, which was delivered in October 2013, affects the City’s Fiscal Year 2015 required contribution rate).  
CalPERS rules require the City to implement the actuary’s recommended rates.  CalPERS provides a lump 

 

39 

 

sum payment option that the City may opt to pay in July of each year, rather than having payment transmitted 
as a percentage of each reported biweekly payroll. 

In calculating the annual actuarially recommended contribution rates, the CalPERS actuary calculates 
on the basis of certain assumptions the actuarial present value of benefits that CalPERS will fund under the 
CalPERS plans, which includes two components, the normal cost and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability 
(the  “UAAL”).    The  normal  cost  represents  the  actuarial  present  value  of  benefits  that  CalPERS  will  fund 
under the CalPERS plans that are attributed to the current year, and the actuarial accrued liability represents 
the actuarial present value of benefits that CalPERS will fund that are attributed to past years.  The UAAL 
represents an estimate of the actuarial shortfall between actuarial value of assets on deposit at CalPERS and the 
present value of the benefits that CalPERS will pay under the CalPERS plans to retirees and active employees 
upon  their  retirement.    The  UAAL  is  based  on  several  assumptions  such  as,  among  others,  the  rate  of 
investment  return,  average  life  expectancy,  average  age  of  retirement,  inflation,  salary  increases  and 
occurrences  of  disabilities.    In  addition,  the  UAAL  includes  certain  actuarial  adjustments  such  as,  among 
others, the actuarial practice of smoothing losses and gains over multiple years (which is described in more 
detail below).  As a result, the UAAL may be considered an estimate of the unfunded actuarial present value of 
the  benefits  that  CalPERS  will  fund  under  the  CalPERS  plans  to  retirees  and  active  employees  upon  their 
retirement  and  not  as  a  fixed  expression  of  the  liability  that  the  City  owes  to  CalPERS  under  its  CalPERS 
plans. 

In  each  actuarial  valuation,  the  CalPERS  actuary  estimates  the  actuarial  value  of  the  assets  (the 
“Actuarial Value”) of the CalPERS plans at the end of the Fiscal Year (which assumes, among other things, 
that the rate of return during that Fiscal Year equaled the assumed rate of return, currently 7.5%.  As described 
below, these policies and actuarial assumptions have changed significantly in recent years and are expected to 
change or be modified further by CalPERS in the future.  The CalPERS actuary uses a smoothing technique to 
determine Actuarial Value that is calculated based on certain policies.  Certain significant recent changes in 
assumptions include the following:   

1. 

On April 17, 2013, the CalPERS Board approved a plan: (i) to replace the current 15 year 
asset-smoothing  policy  with  a  5-year  direct-rate  smoothing  process;  and  (ii)  to  replace  the  current  30  year 
rolling amortization of unfunded liabilities with a 30-year fixed amortization period.  CalPERS’ Chief Actuary 
has stated that the revised approach provides a single measure of funded status and unfunded liabilities, less 
rate volatility in extreme years, a faster path to full funding and more transparency to employers such as the 
City  about  future  contribution  rates.    These  changes  are  expected  to  accelerate  the  repayment  of  unfunded 
liabilities (including CalPERS’ fiscal year 2009 market losses described below) of the City’s CalPERS plan in 
the near term; the exact magnitude of the potential contribution rate increases is not known at this time, but 
may  be  significant.    These  changes  will  be  reflected  beginning  with  the  June  30,  2014  actuarial  valuation 
affecting  contribution  rates  for  Fiscal  Year  2016  and  thereafter.    As  a  preliminary  estimate,  the  City  has 
currently budgeted for increases in its annual pension contributions of approximately $249,553 per year for its 
CalPERS plan. 

2. 

On March 14, 2012, the CalPERS Board approved a change in the inflation assumption used 
in  the  actuarial  assumptions  used  to  determine  employer  contribution  rates.    This  reduced  the  assumed 
investment return from 7.75% to 7.5%, reduced the long-term payroll growth assumption from 3.25% to 3.0%, 
and  adjusted  the  inflation  component  of  individual  salary  scales  from  3.25%  to  a  merit  scale  varying  by 
duration of employment, an assumed annual inflation component of 3% and an annual production growth of 
0.25%.  Although the full impact of such changes is not yet clear, CalPERS has estimated that they could result 
in  net  increases  in  future  contribution  levels  of  approximately  1%  to  2%;  however,  the  reduction  in  the 
inflation  assumption  could  partially  mitigate  increases,  if  any,  in  the  City’s  required  annual  contributions 
resulting from the reduction in the assumed investment rate of return, as described above. 

 

40 

 

In  addition,  in  February  2010,  the  CalPERS  Board  adopted  a  resolution  requiring  additional 
contributions  for  any  plan  or  pool  if  the  cash  flows  hamper  adequate  funding  progress  by  preventing  the 
expected funded status on a market value of assets basis of the plan to either: 

Increase by at least 15% by June 30, 2043; or 

 
  Reach a level of 75% funded by June 30, 2043. 

Such contributions have been factored into the City’s contribution rates set by CalPERS. 

Changes in Pension Accounting Standards.  Reporting obligations under GASB Statement No. 68 
(“GASB 68”) will commence with financial statements for Fiscal Year 2015.  Under GASB 68, there are new 
standards for measuring and recognizing pension liabilities, deferred outflows and inflows of resources, and 
expense/expenditures.  GASB 68 identifies the methods and assumptions that should be used to project benefit 
payments, discount projected benefit payments to their actuarial present value and attribute such present value 
to periods of employee service.   

AB  340.    On  September  12,  2012,  the  State  Governor  signed  AB  340,  which  implements  pension 
reform  in  California.    Effective  January  1,  2013,  AB  340:  (i)  requires  public  retirement  systems  and  their 
participating employers to share equally with employees the normal cost rate for such retirement systems; (ii) 
prohibits  employers  from  paying  employer  paid  member  contributions  to  such  retirement  systems  for 
employees hired after January 1, 2013; (iii) establishes a compulsory maximum non-safety benefit formula of 
2.5%  at  age  67;  (iv)  defines  final  compensation  as  the  highest  average  annual  pensionable  compensation 
earned during a 36 month period; and (v) caps pensionable income at $110,100 ($132,120 for employees not 
enrolled in Social Security) subject to Consumer Price Index increases.   

Other  provisions  reduce  the  risk  of  the  City  incurring  additional  unfunded  liabilities,  including 
prohibiting  retroactive  benefits  increases,  generally  prohibiting  contribution  holidays,  and  prohibiting 
purchases  of  additional  non-qualified  service  credit.    If  AB  340  is  implemented  fully,  CalPERS  estimates 
savings for local agency plans of approximately $1.653 billion to $2.355 billion over the next 30 years due 
primarily to increased employee contributions and, as the workforce turns over, lower benefit formulas that 
will gradually reduce normal costs.  Savings specific to the City have not been quantified.   

Provisions in AB 340 will not likely have a material effect on City’s contributions in the short term.  
However, additional employee contributions, limits on pensionable compensation and higher retirement ages 
for  new  members  will  reduce  the  City’s  UAAL  and  potentially  reduce  City  contribution  levels  in  the  long 
term. 

Change in Pensionable Compensation.  On August 21, 2014, the CalPERS Board approved changes 
to  clarify  the  types  of  compensation  upon  which pension  benefits  are  based,  primarily  for  employees  hired 
after  January  1,  2013.    Under  the  changes,  the  CalPERS  Board  identified  several  dozen  specific  types  of 
compensation  which  will  count  toward  pension  benefit  calculations,  including  temporary  and  special 
assignment  payments  and  certain  categories  of  tasks,  and  identified  types  of  compensation  that  will  not  be 
included in pension benefit calculations.  Although the changes could result in an increase in the City’s future 
CalPERS  contributions,  it  is  not  currently  possible  to  quantify  the  magnitude  of  such  increases.    The  City 
believes that any such changes would be immaterial to its CalPERS contributions. 

For  additional  information  relating  to  the  City’s  plan,  see  Note  8  to  the  City’s  audited  financial 

statements for Fiscal Year 2014 attached hereto as Appendix B. 

No assurance can be provided that the City’s CalPERS plan expenses will not increase significantly in 

the future.

Other Post-Employment Benefits 

The City provides post-employment health care benefits to qualified retired employees.  Employees 
are eligible for such benefits if they were hired prior to September 30, 2011 and retire directly from the City at 
or after age 50 with at least five years of CalPERS membership.  Employees hired after September 30, 2011 
are not eligible for such benefits; the City no longer offers such benefits to employees hired after September 
30,  2011.    The  City’s  plan  is  an  agent  multiple-employer  defined  benefit  other  post-employment  benefits 
(“OPEB”)  plan.    The  OPEB  plan  contributes  an  amount  for  the  retiree  and  dependents,  as  applicable,  for 
certain healthcare services.   

The contribution requirements for OPEB plan participants and the City are established and may be 
amended by the City Council.  The annual required contribution (the “OPEB ARC”) is an amount actuarially 
determined in accordance with the parameters of GASB Statement No. 45.  The OPEB ARC is equal to the 
normal cost each year plus a closed 30 year period amortization (ending in 2028) of the unfunded actuarial 
liability.  Based on the actuarial valuation of the City’s OPEB plan as of June 30, 2013, the OPEB ARC for 
Fiscal Year 2015 was approximately $902,000 and the OPEB ARC for Fiscal Year 2016 is expected to be 
$904,000.  The OPEB valuation that was prepared as of June 30, 2013, in accordance with GASB Statement 
No. 45, was used for reporting OPEB information in the City’s financial statements for Fiscal Year 2014.   

In July 2015, Bartel & Associates completed an actuarial valuation of the City’s OPEB plan based on 
a valuation date of January 1, 2015.  The report was developed in accordance with new accounting standards 
established by GASB Statement No. 75 (“GASB 75”), which requires that the valuation include the value of 
the “implied subsidy” of older retired participants by a younger active workforce in a pooled rate medical plan.  
The City intends to continue to pay the full OPEB ARC without the impact of the implied subsidy included. 

Based on the 2015 actuarial valuation of the City’s OPEB plan, the OPEB ARC for Fiscal Year 2017 
is expected to be $1,426,000 using the new methodology compliant with GASB 75 (or $1,341,000 using the 
old methodology). 

The City is not required to fund the amortization of the unfunded actuarial liability.  Prior to June 
2009, the City’s policy was to pay for OPEB plan costs as they are incurred.  In June 2009, the City Council 
approved the establishment of an irrevocable OPEB trust (the “OPEB Trust”) and approved and authorized an 
agreement  with  CalPERS  to  administer  the  OPEB  Trust  on  its  behalf.    The  City  estimates  that  the 
establishment of the OPEB Trust and pre-funding of the City’s OPEB liability will significantly reduce the 
City’s unfunded OPEB obligation.  Based on the 2015 actuarial valuation, the actuarial unfunded liability of 
the City’s OPEB plan was estimated to be approximately $10,343,000 using the new methodology compliant 
with GASB 75 (or $9,428,000 using the old methodology).   

The City’s annual OPEB cost, the percentage of annual OPEB cost contributed to the plan, and the net 

OPEB obligation for the last five Fiscal Years was as follows:

(2)  This figure is based on the June 30, 2013 actuarial valuation. 

Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of expected benefit payments 
and  assumptions  about  the  probability  of  occurrence  of  events  far  into  the  future.    Examples  include 
assumptions  about  future  employment,  mortality,  and  the  healthcare  cost  trend.    Amounts  determined 
regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required contributions of the employer are subject to 
continual revision as actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made about the 
future.    The  schedule  of  funding  progress,  presented  as  required  supplementary  information  following  the 
notes to the City’s financial statements set forth in Appendix B, presents multi-year trend information about 
whether the actuarial value of OPEB plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial 
accrued liabilities for benefits. 

Projections of benefits are based on the substantive plan and include the types of benefits in force at 
the valuation date and the pattern of sharing benefit costs between the City and the plan members to that point.  
Actuarial calculations reflect a long-term perspective and employ methods and assumptions that are designed 
to  reduce  short-term  volatility  in  actuarial  accrued  liabilities  and  the  actuarial  value  of  assets.    Significant 
methods and assumptions are described in detail in Note 9 to Appendix B. 

City Investment Policy 

The City invests its funds in accordance with the City’s investment policy (the “Investment Policy”), 
which was most recently amended in June 2015.  In accordance with Section 53600 et seq. of the California 
Government  Code,  idle  cash  management  and  investment  transactions  are  the  responsibility  of  the  City 
Treasurer.  The City’s Investment Policy sets forth the policies and procedures applicable to the investment of 
City funds and designates eligible investments.  The Investment Policy sets forth a stated objective, among 
others, of insuring the safety of invested funds by limiting credit and market risks.  Eligible investments are 
generally limited to the Local Agency Investment Fund which is operated by the California State Treasurer, the 
County  investment  pool  for  local  agencies,  local  agency  bonds,  U.S.  Treasury  Bills,  Notes  and  Bonds, 
obligations issued by United States Government agencies, FDIC-insured or negotiable certificates of deposit, 
repurchase agreements, banker’s acceptances and commercial paper rated A1/P1, as applicable, or better, and 
money market funds rated in the highest category by Moody’s or S&P or administered by a domestic bank 
with long-term debt rated in one of the top two categories of Moody’s and S&P.  Funds are invested in the 
following order of priority: 

  Safety of Principal; 
  Liquidity; and 
  Return on Investment. 

The City Treasurer is required to provide a quarterly report to the City Manager and the City Council 
showing the type of investment, date of maturity, amount invested, current market value, rate of interest, and 
other such information as may be required by the City Council.

RISK FACTORS 

The  following  factors,  along  with  the  other  information  in  this  Official  Statement,  should  be 
considered by potential investors in evaluating the purchase of the Series 2015 Bonds.  However, the following 
does not purport to be an exhaustive listing of risks and other considerations which may be relevant to an 
investment in the Series 2015 Bonds.  In addition, the order in which the following factors are presented is not 
intended to reflect the relative importance of any such risks. 

General Considerations – Security for the Series 2015 Bonds 

The  Series  2015  Bonds  are  special  obligations  of  the  Authority,  payable  solely  from  Base  Rental 
Payments and the other assets pledged under the Trust Agreement.  Neither the faith and credit nor the taxing 
power of the Authority, the City, the State, or any political subdivision thereof, is pledged to the payment of 
the Series 2015 Bonds.  The Authority has no taxing power. 

The obligation of the City to make the Base Rental Payments does not constitute a debt of the City, 
the  County  or  the  State  or  any  political  subdivision  thereof  within  the  meaning  of  any  constitutional  or 
statutory  debt  limit  or  restriction,  and  does  not  constitute  an  obligation  for  which  the  City  or  the  State  is 
obligated to levy or pledge any form of taxation or for which the City, the County or the State has levied or 
pledged any form of taxation. 

Although the Facilities Sublease does not create a pledge, lien or encumbrance upon the funds of the 
City,  the  City  is  obligated  under  the  Facilities  Sublease  to  pay  the  Base  Rental  Payments  and  Additional 
Payments from any source of legally available funds, and the City has covenanted in the Facilities Sublease to 
take such action as may be necessary to include all such Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments due 
thereunder  in  its  annual  budgets,  and  to  make  necessary  annual  appropriations  for  all  such  Base  Rental 
Payments and Additional Payments, subject to abatement.  The City is currently liable and may become liable 

 

44 

 

on other obligations payable from general revenues.  See the caption “CITY FINANCIAL INFORMATION—
Indebtedness—General Fund-Supported Debt.” 

The  City  has  the  capacity  to  enter  into  other  obligations  which  may  constitute  additional  charges 
against  its  revenues,  including  pension  obligations  and  essential  services.    To  the  extent  that  additional 
obligations are incurred by the City, the funds available to make Base Rental Payments may be decreased.  In 
the event that the City’s revenue sources are less than its total obligations, the City could choose to fund other 
activities before  making Base Rental Payments and other payments due under the Facilities Sublease.  The 
same result could occur if, because of State Constitutional limits on expenditures, the City is not permitted to 
appropriate and spend all of its available revenues.  However, the City’s appropriations have never exceeded 
the  limitation  on  appropriations  under  Article  XIIIB  of  the  State  Constitution.    See  the  caption 
“CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND APPROPRIATIONS—Article 
XIIIB of the State Constitution.” 

Abatement 

In  the  event  of  substantial  interference  with  the  City’s  right  to  use  and  occupy  any  portion  of  the 
Property by reason of damage to or destruction or condemnation of the Property, or any defects in title to the 
Property, Base Rental Payments will be subject to abatement.  See the caption “SECURITY AND SOURCES 
OF  PAYMENT  FOR  THE  SERIES  2015  BONDS—Abatement.”    In  the  event  that  such  portion  of  the 
Property, if damaged or destroyed by an insured casualty, could not be replaced during the period of time in 
which proceeds of the City’s rental interruption insurance will be available in lieu of Base Rental Payments, 
plus  the  period  in  which  funds  are  available  from  the  funds  and  accounts  established  under  the  Trust 
Agreement, or in the event that casualty insurance proceeds are insufficient to provide for complete repair or 
replacement  of  such  portion  of  the  Property  or  redemption  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds,  there  could  be 
insufficient funds to make payments to Owners in full.   

It is not always possible to predict the circumstances under which abatement of rental may occur.  In 
addition, there is no statute, case or other law specifying how such an abatement of rental should be measured.  
For example, it is not clear whether fair rental value is established as of commencement of the lease or at the 
time of the abatement.  If the latter, the value of the Property could be substantially higher or lower than its 
value at the time of the issuance of the Series 2015 Bonds.  Abatement, therefore, could have an uncertain and 
material adverse effect on the security for and payment of the Series 2015 Bonds. 

If damage, destruction, title defect or eminent domain proceedings with respect to the Property results 
in abatement of the Base Rental Payments related to such Property and if such abated Base Rental Payments, if 
any, together with moneys from rental interruption or use and occupancy insurance (in the event of any insured 
loss due to damage or destruction), and eminent domain proceeds, if any, are insufficient to make all payments 
of principal and interest with respect to the Series 2015 Bonds during the period that the Property is being 
replaced, repaired or reconstructed, then all or a portion of such payments of principal and interest may not be 
made.  Under the Facilities Sublease and the Trust Agreement, no remedy is available to the Series 2015 Bond 
Owners for nonpayment under such circumstances. 

Natural Disasters 

The  occurrence  of  any  natural  disaster  in  the  City,  including,  without  limitation,  fire,  windstorm, 
drought,  earthquake  or  flood,  could  have  an  adverse  material  impact  on  the  economy  within  the  City,  its 
General Fund and the revenues available for the payment of the Base Rental Payments.  The City does not 
maintain earthquake insurance for the Property. 

Earthquakes  are  considered  a  threat  to  the  City  due  to  the  highly  active  seismic  region  and  the 
proximity of fault zones, which could influence the entire southern coastal portion of the State.  However, no 
major earthquake has caused substantial damage to the City.  

 

45 

 

An  earthquake  along one  of  the  faults  in  the  vicinity  of  the  City,  either  known or  unknown,  could 
cause a number of casualties and extensive property damage.  The effects of such a quake could be aggravated 
by aftershocks and secondary effects such as fires, landslides, dam failure, liquefaction and other threats to 
public health, safety and welfare.  The potential direct and indirect consequences of a major earthquake could 
easily  exceed  the  resources  of  the  City  and  would  require  a  high  level  of  self-help,  coordination  and 
cooperation.  

The occurrence of natural disasters in the City could result in substantial damage to the City which, in 
turn,  could  substantially  reduce  General  Fund  revenues  and  affect  the  ability  of  the  City  to  make  the  Base 
Rental Payments.  Reduced ability to make the Base Rental Payments could affect the payment of the principal 
of  and  interest  on  the  Series  2015  Bonds.    The  City  maintains  liability  insurance  and  property  casualty 
insurance (for losses other than from seismic events) for the Property.  See the caption “THE CITY—Risk 
Management.”  However, there can be no assurance that specific losses will be covered by insurance or, if 
covered, that claims will be paid in full by the applicable insurers.    

Hazardous Substances 

An  additional  environmental  condition  that  may  result  in  the  reduction  in  the  assessed  value  of 
property, and therefore property tax revenue available to make Base Rental Payments, would be the discovery 
of a hazardous substance that would limit the beneficial use of taxable property within the City.  In general, the 
owners and operators of a property may be required by law to remedy conditions of the property relating to 
releases  or  threatened  releases  of  hazardous  substances.    The  Federal  Comprehensive  Environmental 
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, sometimes referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund 
Act,” is the most well-known and widely applicable of these laws, but State laws with regard to hazardous 
substances are also stringent and similar in effect.  Under many of these laws, the owner or operator may be 
required  to  remedy  a  hazardous  substance  condition  of  property  whether  or  not  the  owner  or  operator  has 
anything to do with creating or handling the hazardous substance.  The effect, therefore, should any of the 
property within the City be affected by a hazardous substance, could be to reduce the marketability and value 
of such property by the costs of remedying the condition, because the purchaser, upon becoming owner, will 
become obligated to remedy the condition just as is the seller.   

The City has not independently verified, but is not aware of, the presence of any hazardous substances 
on the Property.  Hazardous substance liabilities may arise in the future with respect to any of the property in 
the City resulting from the existence, currently, of a substance presently classified as hazardous but which has 
not been released or the release of which is not presently threatened, or may arise in the future resulting from 
the existence, currently, on the parcel of a substance not presently classified as hazardous but which may in the 
future be so classified.  Additionally, such liabilities may arise from the method of handling such substance.  
These  possibilities  could  significantly  affect  the  value  of  a  parcel  and  could  result  in  substantial  delays  in 
completing planned development on parcels that are currently undeveloped. 

Other Financial Matters 

Due  to  weakness  in  the  economy  of  the  State  and  the  United  States,  it  is  possible  that  the  general 
revenues of the City will decline.  Such financial matters may have a detrimental impact on the City’s General 
Fund, and, accordingly, may reduce the City’s ability to make Base Rental Payments.  See the caption “CITY 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION.” 

In addition, City expenses could also rise as a result of unforeseen events, including but not limited to 
increases  in  pension  obligations  or  a  determination  that  the  Successor  Agency’s  payment  obligations  under 
various agreements with the City are not enforceable obligations.  Such a determination could require the City 
to make payments that were expected to come from Successor Agency funds from General Fund moneys or 
cause moneys received from the Successor Agency to be lower than budgeted.  See the caption “STATE OF 
CALIFORNIA BUDGET INFORMATION—Redevelopment Dissolution.”

Substitution, Addition and Removal of Property; Additional Bonds 

The Authority and the City may amend the Facilities Sublease: (a) to substitute alternate real property 
for any portion of the Property; (b) to add additional real property to the Property; or (c) to release a portion of 
the Property from the Facilities Sublease, upon compliance with all of the conditions set forth in the Facilities 
Sublease.  After a substitution or release, the portion of the Property for which the substitution or release has 
been  effected  will  be  released  from  the  leasehold  encumbrance  of  the  Facilities  Sublease.    Moreover,  the 
Authority  may  issue  Additional  Bonds  secured  by  Base  Rental  Payments  which  are  increased  from  current 
levels.    See  the  captions  “SECURITY  AND  SOURCES  OF  PAYMENT  FOR  THE  SERIES  2015 
BONDS―Substitution,  Addition  and  Removal  of  Property”  and  “SECURITY  AND  SOURCES  OF 
PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES 2015 BONDS—Additional Bonds.”   

Although the Facilities Sublease requires, among other things, that the Property, as constituted after 
such  substitution  or  release,  have  an  annual  fair  rental  value  at  least  equal  to  the  maximum  Base  Rental 
Payments becoming due in the then current Fiscal Year or in any subsequent Fiscal Year, it does not require 
that such Property have an annual fair rental value equal to the annual fair rental value of the Property at the 
time  of  substitution  or  release.    Thus,  a  portion  of  the  Property  could  be  replaced  with  less  valuable  real 
property, or could be released altogether.  Such a replacement or release could have an adverse impact on the 
security for the Series 2015 Bonds, particularly if an event requiring abatement of Base Rental Payments were 
to occur subsequent to such substitution or release.  See Appendix A. 

The Trust Agreement requires, among other things, that upon the issuance of Additional Bonds, the 
Facilities Lease and the Facilities Sublease will be amended, to the extent necessary, so as to increase the Base 
Rental Payments payable by the City thereunder by an aggregate amount equal to the principal of and interest 
on such Additional Bonds; provided, however, that no such amendment will be made such that the sum of 
Base Rental Payments, including any increase in the Base Rental Payments as a result of such amendment, 
plus Additional Payments, in any Fiscal Year is in excess of the annual fair rental value of the Property after 
taking into account the use of the proceeds of any Additional Bonds issued in connection therewith.  See the 
caption  “SECURITY  AND  SOURCES  OF  PAYMENT  FOR  THE  SERIES  2015  BONDS—Additional 
Bonds”  for  a  full  description  of  the  requirements  that  must  be  met  in  order  for  the  Authority  to  issue 
Additional Bonds. 

Limited Recourse on Default; No Acceleration of Base Rental 

Failure by the City to make Base Rental Payments or other payments required to be made under the 
Facilities Sublease, or failure to observe and perform any other terms, covenants or conditions contained in the 
Facilities Sublease or in the Trust Agreement for a period of 30 days after written notice of such failure and 
request that it be remedied has been given to the City by the Authority or the Trustee, constitute events of 
default under the Facilities Sublease and permit the Trustee or the Authority to pursue any and all remedies 
available.    In  the  event  of  a  default,  notwithstanding  anything  in  the  Facilities  Sublease  or  in  the  Trust 
Agreement to the contrary, there is no right under any circumstances to accelerate the Base Rental Payments or 
otherwise declare any Base Rental Payments not then in default to be immediately due and payable, nor do the 
Authority or the Trustee have any right to re-enter or re-let the Property except as described in the Facilities 
Sublease. 

The enforcement of any remedies provided in the Facilities Sublease and the Trust Agreement could 
prove  both  expensive  and  time  consuming.    If  the  City  defaults  on  its  obligation  to  make  Base  Rental 
Payments  with  respect  to  the  Property,  the  Trustee,  as  assignee  of  the  Authority,  may  retain  the  Facilities 
Sublease and hold the City liable for all Base Rental Payments thereunder on an annual basis and enforce any 
other terms or provisions of the Facilities Sublease to be kept or performed by the City. 

Alternatively, the Authority or the Trustee may terminate the Facilities Sublease, retake possession of 
the Property and proceed against the City to recover damages pursuant to the Facilities Sublease.  Due to the 

 

47 

 

specialized and limited nature of the Property, existing Permitted Encumbrances (as such term is defined in 
Appendix A) on the Property, and the restrictions on its use, it is unlikely that the Trustee would be able to 
re-let the Property so as to provide rental income sufficient to make all payments of principal of, interest and 
premium, if any, on the Series 2015 Bonds when due.  Similar limitations and constraints would apply to any 
property  substituted  for  the  Property  pursuant  to  the  Facilities  Sublease.    Moreover,  the  Trustee  is  not 
empowered to sell the Property for the benefit of the Owners of the Series 2015 Bonds.  Any suit for money 
damages would be subject to limitations on legal remedies against cities in the State, including a limitation on 
enforcement  of  judgments  against  funds  needed  to  serve  the  public  welfare  and  interest.    See  the  captions 
“SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES 2015 BONDS” and “THE PROPERTY” 
and Appendix A. 

Possible Insufficiency of Insurance Proceeds 

The  Facilities  Sublease  obligates  the  City  to  keep  in  force  various  forms  of  insurance,  subject  to 
deductibles,  for  repair  or  replacement  of  the  Property  in  the  event  of  damage,  destruction  or  title  defects, 
subject  to  certain  exceptions.    The  Authority  and  the  City  make  no  representation  as  to  the  ability  of  any 
insurer to fulfill its obligations under any insurance policy obtained pursuant to the Facilities Sublease and no 
assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any such insurance to fund necessary repair or replacement or to 
pay  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Series  2015  Bonds  when  due.    In  addition,  certain  risks,  such  as 
earthquakes and  floods,  are  not  required to  be  covered under  the  Facilities  Sublease,  and  therefore,  are not 
carried by the City.  See the captions “SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES 2015 
BONDS—Insurance” and “THE CITY—Risk Management.” 

Limitations on Remedies 

The rights of the Owners of the Series 2015 Bonds are subject to the limitations on legal remedies 
against cities in the State, including a limitation on enforcement of judgments against funds needed to serve the 
public welfare and interest.  Furthermore, the remedies available to the Owners of the Series 2015 Bonds upon 
the occurrence of an event of default under the Trust Agreement or the Facilities Sublease are in many respects 
dependent upon judicial actions which are often subject to discretion and delay and could prove both expensive 
and time consuming to obtain. 

 Additionally, enforceability of the rights and remedies of the Owners of the Series 2015 Bonds, and 
the obligations incurred by the City, may become subject to the provisions of Title 11 of the United States 
Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar 
laws  relating  to  or  affecting  the  enforcement  of  creditors’  rights  generally,  now  or  later  in  effect,  equity 
principles which may limit the specific enforcement under State law of certain remedies, the exercise by the 
United  States  of  America  of  the  powers  delegated  to  it  by  the  federal  Constitution,  the  reasonable  and 
necessary exercise, in certain exceptional situations, of the police powers inherent in the sovereignty of the 
State and its governmental bodies in the interest of serving a significant and legitimate public purpose and the 
limitations on remedies against cities in the State.  Bankruptcy proceedings, or the exercise of powers by the 
federal  or  State  government,  if  initiated,  could  subject  the  Owners  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds  to  judicial 
discretion and interpretation of their rights in bankruptcy or otherwise, and consequently may entail risks of 
delay, limitation or modification of their rights.  Under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, which governs the 
bankruptcy proceedings for public agencies such as the City, involuntary petitions are not permitted.  If the 
City were to file a petition under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Owners of the Series 2015 Bonds, the 
Trustee and the Authority could be prohibited from taking any steps to enforce their rights under the Facilities 
Sublease, and from taking any steps to collect amounts due from the City under the Facilities Sublease. 

The  opinion  to  be  delivered  by  Bond  Counsel  concurrently  with  the  execution  and  delivery  of  the 
Series  2015  Bonds  will  be  subject  to  such  limitations  and  the  various  other  legal  opinions  to  be  delivered 
concurrently with the issuance of the Series 2015 Bonds will be similarly qualified.  See Appendix C.  In the 
event that the City fails to comply with its covenants under the Facilities Sublease or fails to pay Base Rental 

 

48 

 

Payments,  there  can  be  no  assurance  of  the  availability  of  remedies  adequate  to  protect  the  interest  of  the 
Owners of the Series 2015 Bonds. 

No Liability of Authority to the Owners 

Except as expressly provided in the Trust Agreement, the Authority has no obligation or liability to 
the Owners of the Series 2015 Bonds with respect to: (a) the payment when due of the Base Rental Payments 
by the City; (b) the performance by the City of other agreements and covenants required to be performed by it 
contained in the Facilities Sublease or the Trust Agreement; or (c) the performance by the Trustee of any right 
or obligation required to be performed by it contained in the Trust Agreement. 

Secondary Market 

There can be no guarantee that there will be a secondary market for the Series 2015 Bonds or, if a 
secondary  market  exists,  that  the  Series  2015  Bonds  can  be  sold  for  any  particular  price.    Occasionally, 
because of general market conditions or because of adverse history or economic prospects connected with a 
particular issue, secondary marketing practices are suspended or terminated.  Additionally, prices of issues for 
which  a  market  is  being  made  will  depend  upon  then  prevailing  circumstances.    Such  prices  could  be 
substantially different from the original purchase price. 

Risks Associated with Bond Insurance  

In the event that the Authority defaults in the payment of principal of or interest on the Series 2015 
Bonds when due, the owners of the Series 2015 Bonds will have a claim under the Policy for such payments.  
See the caption “BOND INSURANCE.”  In the event that AGM becomes obligated to make payments with 
respect  to  the  Series  2015  Bonds,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  such  event  will  not  adversely  affect  the 
market  for  the  Series  2015  Bonds.    In  the  event  that AGM  is  unable  to  make  payment  of  principal  of  and 
interest on the Series 2015 Bonds when due under the Policy, the Series 2015 Bonds will be payable solely 
from  Revenues  and  amounts  held  in  certain  funds  and  accounts  established  under  the  Trust  Agreement,  as 
described  under  the  caption  “SECURITY  AND  SOURCES  OF  PAYMENT  FOR  THE  SERIES  2015 
BONDS.” 

The long-term rating on the Series 2015 Bonds is dependent in part on the financial strength of AGM 
and  its  claims-paying  ability.    AGM’s  financial  strength  and  claims-paying  ability  are  predicated  upon  a 
number of factors which could change over time.  If the long-term ratings of AGM are lowered, such event 
could adversely affect the market for the Series 2015 Bonds.  See the caption “RATINGS.” 

None of the Authority, the City nor the Underwriter have made an independent investigation of the 
claims-paying ability of AGM and no assurance or representation regarding the financial strength or projected 
financial  strength  of  AGM  is  being  made  by  the  Authority,  the  City  or  the  Underwriter  in  this  Official 
Statement.  Therefore, when making an investment decision with respect to the Series 2015 Bonds, potential 
investors should carefully consider the ability of the Authority to pay principal and interest on the Series 2015 
Bonds,  assuming  that  the  Policy  is  not  available  for  that  purpose,  and  the  claims-paying  ability  of  AGM 
through final maturity of the Bonds. 

So long as the Policy remains in effect and AGM is not in default of its obligations thereunder, AGM 
has certain notice, consent and other rights under the Trust Agreement and will have the right to control all 
remedies for default under the Trust Agreement.  AGM is not required to obtain the consent of the owners of 
the Series 2015 Bonds with respect to the exercise of remedies.  See Appendix A.

State Budget 

STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUDGET INFORMATION 

Information about the State budget is regularly available at various State-maintained websites.  Text of 
proposed and adopted budgets may be found at the website of the State Department of Finance (the “DOF”), 
http://www.dof.ca.gov, under the heading “California Budget.”  An impartial analysis of the budget is posted 
by the Legislative Analyst’s Office (the “LAO”) at http://www.lao.ca.gov.  In addition, various State official 
statements, many of which contain a summary of the current and past State budgets and the impact of those 
budgets on cities in the State, may be found at the website of the State Treasurer, http://www.treasurer.ca.gov.  
The information referred to is prepared by the respective State agency maintaining each website and not by the 
City, and the City can take no responsibility for the continued accuracy of these Internet addresses or for the 
accuracy,  completeness  or  timeliness  of  information  posted  there,  and  such  information  is  not  incorporated 
herein by these references. 

Budget for State Fiscal Year 2015-16 

In  recent  years,  when  there  have  been  anticipated  State  budget  shortfalls,  the  State  Governor  has 
proposed, and the State Legislature has approved, the shift of property tax revenues from cities, counties and 
special districts to schools.  See the caption “CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON 
TAXES AND APPROPRIATIONS—Proposition 1A.”   

On June 24, 2015, the Governor signed into law the State budget for fiscal year 2015-16 (the “2015-16 
Budget”).  The following information is drawn from the DOF’s summary of the 2015-16 Budget, as well as a 
summary  prepared  by  the  LAO.    The  City  can  take  no  responsibility  for  the  accuracy,  completeness  or 
timeliness of information in such summaries. 

For  fiscal  year  2014-15,  the  2015-16  Budget  projects  total  State  general  fund  revenues  of 
approximately $111.3 billion and total State general fund expenditures of approximately $114.5 billion.  The 
2015-16  Budget  projects  that  the  State  will  end  fiscal  year  2014-15  with  a  general  fund  ending  balance  of 
approximately $2.4 billion and total reserves of approximately $3 billion (including approximately $1.5 billion 
in  the  traditional  general  reserve  and  approximately  $1.6  billion  in  the  Budget  Stabilization  Account  (the 
“BSA”),  the  State’s  basic  reserve  fund).    For  fiscal  year  2015-16,  the  2015-16  Budget  projects  total  State 
general fund revenues of approximately $115 billion and total expenditures of approximately $115.4 billion, 
leaving  the  State  with  a  year-end  general  fund  balance  of  approximately  $2  billion.    The  2015-16  Budget 
projects  total  year-end  reserves  of  approximately  $4.6  billion,  including  approximately  $1.1  billion  in  the 
traditional general fund reserve and approximately $3.5 billion in the BSA. 

As a result of higher than anticipated State revenues, the 2015-16 Budget includes revised estimates to 
the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantees for schools for fiscal years 2013-14 and 2014-15.  The fiscal 
year  2013-14  minimum  guarantee  is  revised  upward  to  approximately  $58.9  billion,  an  increase  of 
approximately $612 million over the estimate included in the fiscal year 2014-15 State budget.  For fiscal year 
2014-15,  the  2015-16  Budget  revises  the  minimum  guarantee  upward  to  approximately  $66.3  billion,  an 
increase of approximately $5.4 billion over the estimate included in the fiscal year 2014-15 State budget. 

The 2015-16 Budget sets the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee for fiscal year 2015-16 at 
approximately  $68.4  billion,  including  approximately  $49.4  billion  of  support  from  the  State  general  fund.  
This  represents  a  year-to-year  increase  of  approximately  $2.1  billion  over  the  revised  level  for  fiscal  year 
2014-15.    For  K-12  education,  the  2015-16  Budget  provides  total  Proposition  98  funding  of  approximately 
$59.5 billion, including approximately $43.2 billion from the State general fund.  Under the 2015-16 Budget, 
K-12 per-pupil spending in fiscal year 2015-16 is $9,942, an increase of $1,011 (or approximately 11%) from 
the prior year. 

 

50 

 

Significant proposals or adjustments set forth in the 2015-16 Budget affecting public agencies in the 

State include the following: 

• 

Law Enforcement.  The 2015-16 Budget continues a $40 million general fund allocation to 
“front  line”  law  enforcement  activities.  The  Board  of  State  and  Community  Corrections  allocates  funds to 
individual cities acting as the fiduciary agent within each county receiving the funds. 

• 

Transportation.  The 2015-16 Budget includes total funding of approximately $15.9 billion 
(approximately  $261  million  from  the  general  fund  and  $15.7  billion  from  other  funds)  for  all  programs 
administered within the State Transportation Agency.  In addition, the shared revenues budget allocates over 
$1.4 billion in fuel excise tax to cities and counties for local streets and roads. 

• 

Elimination of Redevelopment Agencies.  The 2015-16 Budget anticipates that in State fiscal 
years 2014-15 and 2015-16 combined, cities will receive approximately $580 million, counties will receive 
approximately $660 million and special districts will receive approximately $200 million.   

• 

Property Taxes.  The 2015-16 Budget anticipates ongoing property tax revenues of more than 
$900  million  annually  to  be  distributed  to  cities,  counties,  and  special  districts  that  can  be  used  by  local 
governments to fund police, fire, and other critical public services. 

• 

State  Mandate  Reimbursements.    The  2015-16  Budget  continues  the  suspension  of  most 
mandates not related to law enforcement or property taxes.  After satisfying the State Constitutional funding 
guarantee, additional revenues of up to $800 million are proposed to pay down the remainder of the State’s 
pre-2004 mandate debt.  The 2015-16 Budget estimates that a trigger mechanism will result in a $533 million 
payment toward this mandate debt.  These funds will provide counties, cities, and special districts with general 
purpose revenue. 

• 

Deferred  Maintenance.  The  2015-16  Budget 

includes  approximately  $478  million 
(approximately  $125  million  from  the  general  fund)  for  critical  deferred  maintenance  at  universities, 
community colleges and in State parks, prisons, State hospitals and other State facilities. 

• 

Education.    The  2015-16  Budget  provides  over  $1.2  billion  in  funding  to  support  a 
coordinated  framework  for  adult  education,  career  technical  education,  workforce  investment,  and 
apprenticeships intended to provide training and education to workers in California. 

• 

Drought Response.  The State has experienced four consecutive years of below‑average rain 
and snow, and is currently facing severe drought conditions in all 58 counties.  The 2015-16 Budget includes 
the  amount  of  approximately  $1.8  billion  (in  addition  to  approximately  $1.9  billion  that  was  previously 
appropriated) of one-time resources to continue the State’s response to drought impacts.  The funds will protect 
and expand local water supplies, conserve water and respond to emergency conditions. 

The  Governor’s  Budget  Summary  for  the  Proposed  Budget  (the  “2015-16  Proposed  Budget 
Summary”),  which  was  released  in  January  2015,  cautioned  that,  since  2000,  the  State’s  short  periods  of 
balanced budgets have been followed by massive budget shortfalls.  The 2015-16 Proposed Budget Summary 
also noted that commitments made by the State in the past two years are already straining the State’s finances.  
Under a projection of current policies, the 2015-16 Proposed Budget Summary anticipated that the State would 
begin  to  spend  more  than  it  receives  in  annual  revenues  by  State  fiscal  year  2018-19,  by  an  amount  of 
approximately $1 billion.  The City cannot predict whether the State will take steps, in response to a future 
budget shortfall, which would reduce the amount of tax revenue available to the City.  The State budget will be 
affected by national and State economic conditions and other factors over which the City will have no control.  
State  budget  shortfalls  in  future  fiscal  years  may  also  have  an  adverse  financial  impact  on  the  financial 
condition of the City.   

 

51 

 

The 2015-16 Budget also includes an update of the trigger mechanism payment discussed in the bullet 
point “State Mandate Reimbursements.”  The 2015-16 Budget estimates that the trigger mechanism calculation 
will  result  in  a  $765  million  payment  toward  pre-2004  mandate  debt  (an  increase  of  approximately  $232 
million  from  the  proposed  fiscal  year  2015-16  budget)  owed  by  the  State  to  cities,  counties  and  special 
districts. 

For additional information regarding the 2015-16 Budget, see the DOF website at www.dof.ca.gov.  

The information presented on such website is not incorporated herein by reference. 

Potential Impact of State Financial Condition on the City 

The  State  has  experienced  significant  financial  stress  in  recent  years,  with  budget  shortfalls  in  the 
several billions of dollars.  There can be no assurance that, as a result of such State financial stress, the State 
will not significantly reduce revenues to local governments (including the City) or shift financial responsibility 
for programs to local governments as part of its efforts to address the State financial difficulties.  Although the 
State is not a significant source of City revenues, no prediction can be made by the City as to what measures 
the  State  will  adopt  to  respond  to  the  current  or  potential  future  financial  difficulties.    There  can  be  no 
assurance  that  State  actions  to  respond  to  State  financial  difficulties  will  not  adversely  affect  the  financial 
condition of the City. 

Redevelopment Dissolution 

General.  On December 29, 2011, the State Supreme Court upheld Assembly Bill 1x26 (“AB 1x26”), 
which dissolved redevelopment agencies in the State.  The effect of AB 1x26 upon the City is the termination 
of the redevelopment functions of the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Moreno Valley (the 
“Former Agency”) and the transfer of such functions to a successor agency (the City, referred to in the capacity 
of a successor agency, and being referred to in this context as the “Successor Agency”) tasked with winding 
down the Former Agency’s redevelopment activities.  Under AB 1x26, the Successor Agency cannot enter into 
new  redevelopment  projects  or  obligations  and  its  assets  can  be  used  only  to  pay  enforceable  obligations, 
which enforceable obligations are generally limited to obligations in existence in mid-2011, when AB 1x26 
was  signed  by  the  Governor.    In  addition,  the  Successor  Agency  will  receive  tax  increment  revenues  in 
amounts that are sufficient to pay 100% (but no greater amount) of such enforceable obligations until such 
obligations (including accrued interest, as applicable) are paid in full, at which time the Successor Agency will 
be dissolved.  Certain tax revenues formerly allocable to the Former Agency will continue to be available to 
the Successor Agency to pay certain obligations, and a portion of such revenues may be redirected to other 
taxing  agencies,  such  as  the  County,  school  districts  and  the  City.    The  Successor  Agency’s  activities  are 
subject  to  review  by  an  oversight  board  established  under  AB  1x26.    Under  AB  1x26,  liabilities  of  the 
Successor Agency are not liabilities of the City. 

On  June  27,  2012,  the  Governor  signed  Assembly  Bill  1484  (“AB  1484”),  which  made  certain 
amendments to AB 1x26.  Under AB 1484, the County Auditor-Controller, the DOF and the State Controller 
may require the return of funds improperly spent or transferred to a public entity in conflict with the provisions 
of  the  Community  Redevelopment  Law,  as  amended by  AB  1x26  and  AB  1484, and if  such  funds  are  not 
returned  within  60  days,  they  may  be  recovered  through  an  offset  of  sales  and  use  tax  or  property  tax 
allocations to the local agency, which, in the case of the Successor Agency, is the City. 

On September 22, 2015, the following amendments to the dissolution legislation discussed under the 
caption “—General” were enacted as Senate Bill 107 (“SB 107”): (1) redevelopment successor agencies that 
enter into a written agreement with the DOF to remit unencumbered cash to the county auditor-controller will 
receive a finding of completion, which provides successor agencies with additional fiscal tools and reduced 
State  oversight;  (2)  successor  agencies  that  that  have  a  “Last  and  Final”  ROPS  (as  discussed  below)  may 
expend a portion of proceeds of bonds issued in 2011, which proceeds are currently frozen; (3) pension or 
State  Water  Project  override  revenues  that  are  not  pledged  to  or  not  needed  for  redevelopment  bond  debt 

 

52 

 

service  will  be  returned  to  the  entity  that  levies  the  override;  (4)  agreements  relating  to  State  highway 
improvements and money loaned to successor agencies to pay costs associated with redevelopment dissolution 
litigation  will  be  considered  enforceable  obligations;  and  (5)  reentered  agreements  entered  into  after  the 
passage of AB 1484 are unenforceable unless entered into for the purpose of providing administrative support.   

SB 107 also: (a) requires the preparation of a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule with respect 
to enforceable obligations (a “ROPS”), which are required to be submitted to the oversight board and the DOF 
in accordance with AB 1x26, once a year beginning with the ROPS period that commences on July 1, 2016 
(rather  than  twice  a  year  under  current  law);  (b)  establishes  an  optional  “Last  and  Final”  ROPS  process 
beginning in September 2015; under this process, a successor agency that elected to submit a “Last and Final 
ROPS  would  no  longer  submit  a  periodic  ROPS  and  the  enforceable  obligations  set  forth  in  the  “Last  and 
Final” ROPS would be binding on all parties; and (c) clarifies that former tax increment caps and plan limits 
do not apply for the purposes of paying approved enforceable obligations. 

Impact on the City.  Significant provisions of AB 1x26, AB 1484, SB 107 and implementing actions 
of affected parties, including the Successor Agency, the oversight board, the County and the DOF,  may be 
subject to legal challenge, statutory or administrative changes and other clarifications which could affect the 
impact  of  the  dissolution  of  redevelopment  on  the  City  and  its  General  Fund.    The  DOF  has  periodically 
proposed  additional  legislation  which  would  modify  statutes  affecting  redevelopment  dissolution;  it  is  not 
known whether additional legislation will be enacted.  The full extent of the impact of the implementation of 
AB 1x26, AB 1484 and SB 107 or potential future legislation on the City’s General Fund is unknown at this 
time.  While certain administrative costs previously charged to the Former Agency by the General Fund will 
no  longer  be  supported  by  the  Successor  Agency,  certain  property  tax  revenues  formerly  allocated  to  the 
Former Agency will now be received by the City’s General Fund.   

The  City  does  not  believe  that  it  has  received  material  amounts  from  the  Former  Agency  or  the 

Successor Agency which may be asserted to be in violation of AB 1x26 or AB 1484. 

There can be no assurance that the City and the Successor Agency will not enter into additional loan 

agreements in the future to enable the Successor Agency to meet its payment obligations in future years.   

 Successor  Agency  Obligations  to  the  General  Fund.    Although  AB  1x26  generally  invalidates 
agreements  between  host  cities  and  their  former  redevelopment  agencies,  provision  is  made  for  the 
enforcement of agreements entered into with respect to obligations which meet certain specified criteria.  The 
City  believes  that  the  Successor  Agency’s  payment  obligations  under  a  note  relating  to  the  Moreno  Valley 
Mall  at  Towngate  (the  “Towngate  Regional  Mall  Note”)  and  miscellaneous  other  advances  (the  “Other 
Advances”)  to  the  Former  Agency,  each  as  described  below,  constitute  enforceable  obligations  of  the 
Successor Agency.  The City expects that the Successor Agency will continue to be able to apply tax increment 
revenues to the payment of such obligations.  The City has listed the Towngate Regional Mall Note and the 
Other  Advances  in  its  ROPS,  and  such  obligations  have  been  approved  as  enforceable  obligations  by  the 
Successor Agency’s oversight board and the DOF.  However, there can be no assurance that such entities, the 
State Controller, other State or County bodies implementing the dissolution of redevelopment or a court will 
not  disagree  with  the  City’s  interpretation  and  seek  to  prohibit  the  Successor  Agency  from  making  the 
payments  on  the  Towngate  Regional  Mall  Note  and  the  Other  Advances  in  the  future  or  that  additional 
legislation could be enacted which will not be consistent with the City’s interpretation.   

As  of  June  30,  2014,  the  Towngate  Regional  Mall  Note  was  outstanding  in  the  principal  of 
$13,000,000.    The  Towngate  Regional  Mall  Note  originated  from  a  participation  agreement  (as  amended) 
whereby  the  Former  Agency  acquired  certain  parcels  within  the  Moreno  Valley  Mall  at  Towngate  for 
subsequent transfer to anchor tenants.  The Towngate Regional Mall Note bears interest at the rate of 7.25% 
per annum and is payable from the property tax increment and up to 50% of the sales tax revenues generated 
from the acquired parcels.   In Fiscal Year 2004, the City purchased the rights to the Towngate Regional Mall 
Note from the holder thereof and, thereafter, has received the associated interest and principal payments related 

 

53 

 

thereto.  Through negotiations with the DOF, the City has reached an agreement which amends the terms of 
the Towngate Regional Mall Note such that $1,400,000 will now be paid annually to the City from revenues in 
the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund maintained by the County Auditor-Controller with respect to the 
former  redevelopment  project  areas  within  the  City  through  December  2035.    On  September  23,  2014  and 
September  24,  2014,  respectively,  the  Successor  Agency  and  the  Successor  Agency’s  oversight  board 
approved resolutions that incorporate terms of the agreement reached between the City and the DOF.  Such 
resolutions  provided  for  the  restructuring  of  the  Towngate  Regional  Mall  Note  payment  schedule  for 
submission to the DOF.  The restructured payment schedule was approved as part of the 2014/15B ROPS on 
November 15, 2014. 

As of June 30, 2014, the Other Advances were outstanding in the principal amount of $652,248.  The 
Other Advances were used by the Former Agency for various redevelopment purposes and are payable from 
available Successor Agency moneys.  The Other Advances bear interest at the rate of 12% but do not have a 
specific maturity date. 

There can be no assurances that AB 1x26, AB 1484 and/or subsequent implementing statutes will not 
interfere with the receipt by the City from the Successor Agency of the amounts contemplated to be received 
by the City pursuant to the Towngate Regional Mall Note, the Other Advances or otherwise. 

To  the  extent  that  the  Successor  Agency’s  assets  are  liquidated  for  distribution  of  proceeds  to  the 
affected  taxing  entities,  the  City  currently  expects  that  the  City’s  General  Fund  will  receive  approximately 
11% of such assets. 

Future State Budgets 

No prediction can be made by the City as to whether the State will continue to encounter budgetary 
problems in future years, and if it were to do so, it is not clear what measures would be taken by the State to 
balance its budget, as required by law.  In addition, the City cannot predict the final outcome of future State 
budget negotiations, the impact that such budgets will have on City finances and operations or what actions 
will be taken in the future by the State Legislature and the Governor to deal with changing State revenues and 
expenditures.  There can be no assurance that actions taken by the State to address its financial condition will 
not materially adversely affect the financial condition of the City.  Current and future State budgets will be 
affected  by  national  and  State  economic  conditions  and  other  factors,  including  the  current  economic 
downturn, over which the City has no control. 

CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND APPROPRIATIONS 

There are a number of provisions in the State Constitution that limit the ability of the City to raise and 

expend tax revenues. 

Article XIIIA of the State Constitution 

On June 6, 1978, State voters approved an amendment (commonly known as both Proposition 13 and 
the Jarvis-Gann Initiative) to the State Constitution.  The amendment, which added Article XIIIA to the State 
Constitution, among other things affects the valuation of real property for the purpose of taxation in that it 
defines the full cash property value to mean “the county assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 
1975/76 tax bill under ‘full cash value’, or thereafter, the appraised value of real property newly constructed, 
or when a change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment.”  The full cash value may be adjusted 
annually to reflect inflation at a rate not to exceed 2% per year, or a reduction in the consumer price index or 
comparable local data at a rate not to exceed 2% per year, or reduced in the event of declining property value 
caused  by  damage,  destruction  or  other  factors  including  a  general  economic  downturn.    The  amendment 
further  limits  the  amount  of  any  ad  valorem  tax  on  real  property  to  1%  of  the  full  cash  value,  except  that 
additional taxes may be levied to pay debt service on indebtedness approved by the voters prior to December 1, 

 

54 

 

1978,  and  bonded  indebtedness  for  the  acquisition  or  improvement  of  real  property  approved  on  or  after 
December 1, 1978 by two-thirds of the votes cast by the voters voting on the proposition (55% in the case of 
certain school facilities).  Property taxes subject to Proposition 13 are a significant source of the City’s General 
Fund revenues.  See the caption “CITY FINANCIAL INFORMATION.” 

Legislation  enacted  by  the  State  Legislature  to  implement  Article XIIIA  provides  that  all  taxable 
property is shown at full assessed value as described above.  Tax rates for voter approved bonded indebtedness 
are also applied to 100% of assessed value.   

Future  assessed  valuation  growth  allowed  under  Article XIIIA  (new  construction,  change  of 
ownership, 2% annual value growth) is allocated on the basis of “situs” among the jurisdictions that serve the 
tax rate area within which the growth occurs.  Local agencies and school districts share the growth of “base” 
revenue from the tax rate area.  Each year’s growth allocation becomes part of each agency’s allocation the 
following year.  Article XIIIA effectively prohibits the levying of any other ad valorem property tax above the 
1% limit except for taxes to support indebtedness approved by the voters as described above.   

Article XIIIA has subsequently been amended to permit reduction of the “full cash value” base in the 
event of declining property values caused by damage, destruction or other factors, and to provide that there 
would  be  no  increase  in  the  “full  cash  value”  base  in  the  event  of  reconstruction  of  property  damaged  or 
destroyed in a disaster and in certain other limited circumstances. 

Article XIIIB of the State Constitution 

At  the  Statewide  special  election  on  November  6,  1979,  the  voters  approved  an  initiative  entitled 
“Limitation  on  Government  Appropriations,”  which  added  Article XIIIB  to  the  State  Constitution.    Under 
Article XIIIB,  State  and  local  government  entities  have  an  annual  “appropriations  limit”  which  limits  the 
ability  to  spend  certain  moneys  which  are  called  “appropriations  subject  to  limitation”  (consisting  of  tax 
revenues and investment proceeds thereof, certain State subventions and regulatory license fees, user charges 
and user fees to the extent that the proceeds thereof exceed the costs of providing such services, together called 
“proceeds  of  taxes,”  and  certain  other  funds)  in  an  amount  higher  than  the  “appropriations  limit.”  
Article XIIIB  does  not  affect  the  appropriation  of  moneys  which  are  excluded  from  the  definition  of 
“appropriations limit,” including debt service on indebtedness existing or authorized as of October 1, 1979, or 
bonded indebtedness subsequently approved by the voters.  In general terms, the “appropriations limit” is to be 
based on certain 1978-79 expenditures and is to be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the consumer price 
index, population and services provided by these entities.  Among other provisions of Article XIIIB, if those 
entities’ revenues in any year exceed the amounts permitted to be spent, the excess would have to be returned 
by revising tax rates or fee schedules over the subsequent two years. 

The City’s appropriations have never exceeded the limitation on appropriations under Article XIIIB of 

the State Constitution. 

Proposition 62 

A statutory initiative (“Proposition 62”) was adopted by the voters of the State at the November 4, 
1986  general election  which:  (a)  requires  that any  tax  for  general  governmental purposes  imposed by  local 
governmental entities be approved by resolution or ordinance adopted by two-thirds vote of the governmental 
agency’s legislative body and by a majority of the electorate of the governmental entity; (b) requires that any 
special  tax  (defined  as  taxes  levied  for  other  than  general  governmental  purposes)  imposed  by  a  local 
governmental entity be approved by a two-thirds vote of the voters within the jurisdiction; (c) restricts the use 
of  revenues  from  a  special  tax  to  the  purposes  or  for  the  service  for  which  the  special  tax  is  imposed;  (d) 
prohibits  the  imposition  of  ad  valorem  taxes  on  real  property  by  local  governmental  entities  except  as 
permitted by Article XIIIA; (e) prohibits the imposition of transaction taxes and sales taxes on the sale of real 
property by local governmental entities; and (f) requires that any tax imposed by a local governmental entity 

 

55 

 

on or after August 1, 1985 be ratified by a majority vote of the electorate within two years of the adoption of 
the  initiative  or  be  terminated  by  November  15,  1988.    The  requirements  imposed  by  Proposition  62  were 
upheld  by  the  State  Supreme  Court  in  Santa  Clara  County  Local  Transportation  Authority  v.  Guardino, 
11 Cal.4th 220 (1995). 

Proposition 62 applies to the imposition of any taxes or the implementation of any tax increases after 
its enactment in 1986, but the requirements of Proposition 62 are largely subsumed by the requirements of 
Proposition 218 for the imposition of any taxes or the effecting of any tax increases after November 5, 1996.  
See the caption “—Proposition 218” below. 

Proposition 218 

On  November 5,  1996,  State  voters  approved  Proposition 218,  an  initiative  measure  entitled  the 
“Right  to  Vote  on  Taxes  Act.”    Proposition 218  added  Articles  XIIIC  and  XIIID  to  the  State  Constitution, 
imposing  certain  vote  requirements  and  other  limitations  on  the  imposition  of  new  or  increased  taxes, 
assessments  and  property-related  fees  and  charges.    Proposition 218  states  that  all  taxes  imposed  by  local 
governments are deemed to be either general taxes or special taxes.  Special purpose districts, including school 
districts,  have  no  power  to  levy  general  taxes.    No  local  government  may  impose,  extend  or  increase  any 
general tax unless and until such tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote.  No local 
government  may  impose,  extend  or  increase  any  special  tax  unless  and  until  such  tax  is  submitted  to  the 
electorate and approved by a two-thirds vote. 

Proposition 218 also provides that no tax, assessment, fee or charge may be assessed by any agency 
upon  any  parcel  of  property  or  upon  any  person  as  an  incident  of  property  ownership  except:  (a)  the  ad 
valorem property tax imposed pursuant to Articles XIII and XIIIA of the State Constitution; (b) any special tax 
receiving  a  two-thirds  vote  pursuant  to  the  State  Constitution;  and  (c)  assessments,  fees  and  charges  for 
property  related  services  as  provided  in  Proposition  218.    Proposition  218  then  goes  on  to  add  voter 
requirements for assessments and fees and charges imposed as an incident of property ownership, other than 
fees and charges for sewer, water, and refuse collection services.  In addition, all assessments and fees and 
charges imposed as an incident of property ownership, including sewer, water, and refuse collection services, 
are subjected to various additional procedures, such as hearings and stricter and more individualized benefit 
requirements and findings.  The effect of such new provisions will presumably be to increase the difficulty a 
local agency will have in imposing, increasing or extending such assessments, fees and charges. 

Proposition  218  also  extended  the  initiative  power  to  reducing  or  repealing  any  local  taxes, 
assessments, fees and charges.  This extension of the initiative power is not limited to taxes imposed on or 
after  November  6,  1996,  the  effective  date  of  Proposition  218,  and  could  result  in  retroactive  repeal  or 
reduction  in  any  existing  taxes,  assessments,  fees  and  charges,  subject  to  overriding  federal  constitutional 
principles relating to the impairments of contracts.  Legislation implementing Proposition 218 provides that the 
initiative power provided for in Proposition 218 “shall not be construed to mean that any owner or beneficial 
owner of a municipal security, purchased before or after (the effective date of Proposition 218) assumes the 
risk  of,  or  in  any  way  consents  to,  any  action  by  initiative  measure  that  constitutes  an  impairment  of 
contractual rights” protected by the United States Constitution.  However, no assurance can be given that the 
voters  of  the  City  will  not,  in  the  future,  approve  an  initiative  which  reduces  or  repeals  local  taxes, 
assessments, fees or charges that currently are deposited into the City’s General Fund. 

Although a portion of the City’s General Fund revenues are derived from general taxes purported to 
be governed by Proposition 218 as discussed under the caption “CITY FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Other 
Taxes,” all of such taxes were imposed in accordance with the requirements of Proposition 218.  No assurance 
can be given that the voters of the City will not, in the future, approve an initiative or initiatives which reduce 
or repeal local taxes, assessments, fees or charges which support the City’s General Fund.

Unitary Property 

Some amount of property tax revenue of the City is derived from utility property which is considered 
part of a utility system with components located in many taxing jurisdictions (“unitary property”).  Under the 
State Constitution, such property is assessed by the State Board of Equalization (the “SBE”) as part of a “going 
concern” rather than as individual pieces of real or personal property.  State-assessed unitary and certain other 
property  is  allocated  to  the  counties  by  the  SBE,  taxed  at  special  county-wide  rates,  and  the  tax  revenues 
distributed to taxing jurisdictions (including the City) according to statutory formula generally based on the 
distribution of taxes in the prior year. 

Proposition 22 

On  November 2,  2010,  voters  in  the  State  approved  Proposition 22,  which  eliminates  the  State’s 
ability  to  borrow  or  shift  local  revenues  and  certain  State  revenues  that  fund  transportation  programs.    It 
restricts the State’s authority over a broad range of tax revenues, including property taxes allocated to cities 
(including the City), counties and special districts, the VLF, State excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, the 
State sales tax on diesel fuel, and the former State sales tax on gasoline.  It also makes a number of significant 
other  changes,  including  restricting  the  State’s  ability  to  use  motor  vehicle  fuel  tax  revenues  to  pay  debt 
service on voter-approved transportation bonds.   

Proposition 1A 

As  part  of  former  Governor  Schwarzenegger’s  agreement  with  local  jurisdictions,  Senate 
Constitutional  Amendment  No.  4  was  enacted  by  the  State  Legislature  and  subsequently  approved  by  the 
voters  as  Proposition  1A  (“Proposition  1A”)  at  the  November  2,  2004  general  election.    Proposition  1A 
amended  the  State  Constitution  to,  among  other  things,  reduce  the  State  Legislature’s  authority  over  local 
government revenue sources by placing restrictions on the State’s access to local governments’ property, sales, 
and vehicle license fee revenues as of November 3, 2004.  Beginning with Fiscal Year 2009, the State may 
borrow  up  to  8%  of  local  property  tax  revenues,  but  only  if  the  Governor  proclaims  that  such  action  is 
necessary due to a severe State fiscal hardship and two-thirds of both houses of the State Legislature approve 
the borrowing.  The amount borrowed is required to be paid back within three years.  The State also will not be 
able to borrow from local property tax revenues for more than two Fiscal Years within a period of ten Fiscal 
Years.  In addition, the State cannot reduce the local sales tax rate or restrict the authority of local governments 
to impose or change the distribution of the Statewide local sales tax. 

The  Fiscal  Year  2010  State  budget  included  a  Proposition  1A  diversion  of  $1.935  billion  in  local 
property  tax  revenues  from  cities,  counties,  and  special  districts  to  the  State  to  offset  State  general  fund 
spending.  Such diverted revenues were required to be repaid, with interest, by no later than June 30, 2013.  
The amount of the Proposition 1A diversion from the City was $1,307,713.  The City participated in the State 
of California Proposition 1A Receivables Program to securitize its receivable from the State, and, as a result, 
received the shifted funds in the amount of $1,307,713, without interest, in two installments in 2010 from the 
California  Statewide  Communities  Development  Authority. 
  See  the  caption  “CITY  FINANCIAL 
INFORMATION—Property Taxes.” 

Proposition 26 

On  November  2,  2010,  voters  in  the  State  approved  Proposition  26.    Proposition  26  amends 
Article XIIIC  of  the  State  Constitution  to  expand  the  definition  of  “tax”  to  include  “any  levy,  charge,  or 
exaction of any kind imposed by a local government” except the following:  (a) a charge imposed for a specific 
benefit conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which 
does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit or granting the privilege; 
(b) a charge imposed for a specific government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not 
provided  to  those  not  charged,  and  which  does  not  exceed  the  reasonable  costs  to  the  local  government  of 

 

57 

 

providing  the  service  or  product;  (c) a  charge  imposed  for  the  reasonable  regulatory  costs  to  a  local 
government  for  issuing  licenses  and  permits,  performing  investigations,  inspections,  and  audits,  enforcing 
agricultural  marketing  orders,  and  the  administrative  enforcement  and  adjudication  thereof;  (d) a  charge 
imposed  for  entrance  to  or  use  of  local  government  property,  or  the  purchase,  rental  or  lease  of  local 
government  property;  (e) a  fine,  penalty  or  other  monetary  charge  imposed  by  the  judicial  branch  of 
government  or  a  local  government  as  a  result of  a  violation of  law;  (f) a  charge imposed  as  a condition  of 
property  development;  and  (g) assessments  and  property-related  fees  imposed  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions of Article XIIID.  Proposition 26 provides that the local government bears the burden of proving by 
a preponderance of the evidence that a levy, charge, or other exaction is not a tax, that the amount is no more 
than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the governmental activity, and that the manner in which those 
costs  are  allocated  to  a  payor  bear  a  fair  or  reasonable  relationship  to  the  payor’s  burdens  on,  or  benefits 
received from, the governmental activity.  The City does not believe that Proposition 26 will adversely affect 
its General Fund revenues. 

Future Initiatives 

Articles XIIIA and XIIIB and Propositions 62, 218, 22, 1A and 26 were each adopted as measures that 
qualified for the ballot pursuant to the State’s initiative process.  From time to time other initiative measures 
could be adopted, further affecting the City’s current revenues or its ability to raise and expend revenues. 

TAX MATTERS 

Interest on the Series 2015 Bonds is not excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes 
under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”).  Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, 
Bond Counsel to the Authority (“Bond Counsel”), is of the opinion that interest on the Series 2015 Bonds is 
exempt from State of California personal income taxes.  Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any 
other tax consequences relating to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual, or receipt of interest 
on, the Series 2015 Bonds.  The proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is contained in Appendix C hereto. 

The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal tax considerations generally applicable to 
holders of the Series 2015 Bonds that acquire their Series 2015 Bonds in the initial offering.  The discussion 
below is based upon laws, regulations, rulings, and decisions in effect and available on the date hereof, all of 
which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.  Prospective investors should note that no rulings 
have been or are expected to be sought from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any 
of the U.S. federal tax consequences discussed below, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not take 
contrary positions.  Further, the following discussion does not deal with U.S. tax consequences applicable to 
any  given  investor,  nor  does  it  address the  U.S.  tax considerations applicable to all  categories of  investors, 
some of which may be subject to special taxing rules (regardless of whether or not such investors constitute 
U.S.  Holders),  such  as  certain  U.S.  expatriates,  banks,  REITs,  RICs,  insurance  companies,  tax-exempt 
organizations,  dealers  or  traders  in  securities  or  currencies,  partnerships,  S  corporations,  estates  and  trusts, 
investors  that  hold  their  Series  2015  Bonds  as  part  of  a  hedge,  straddle  or  an  integrated  or  conversion 
transaction, or investors whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, it does not address (i) 
alternative minimum tax consequences, (ii) the net investment income tax imposed under Section 1411 of the 
Code, or (iii) the indirect effects on persons who hold equity interests in a holder.  This summary also does not 
consider  the  taxation  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds  under  state,  local  or  non-U.S.  tax  laws.    In  addition,  this 
summary generally is limited to U.S. tax considerations applicable to investors that acquire their Series 2015 
Bonds pursuant to this offering for the issue price that is applicable to such Series 2015 Bonds (i.e., the price at 
which a substantial amount of the Series 2015 Bonds are sold to the public) and who will hold their Series 
2015 Bonds as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.   

As used herein, “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Series 2015 Bond that for U.S. federal 
income  tax  purposes  is  an  individual  citizen  or  resident  of  the  United  States,  a  corporation  or  other  entity 
taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof 

 

58 

 

(including the District of Columbia), an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation 
regardless of its source or a trust where a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision 
over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons (as defined in the Code) have the 
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust (or a trust that has made a valid election under U.S. 
Treasury Regulations to be treated as a domestic trust). As used herein, “Non-U.S. Holder” generally means a 
beneficial owner of a Series 2015 Bond (other than a partnership) that is not a U.S. Holder.  If a partnership 
holds Series 2015 Bonds, the tax treatment of such partnership or a partner in such partnership generally will 
depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership.  Partnerships holding Series 
2015  Bonds,  and  partners  in  such  partnerships,  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding  the  tax 
consequences of an investment in the Series 2015 Bonds (including their status as U.S. Holders or Non-U.S. 
Holders). 

Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors in determining the U.S. federal, state, local 
or non-U.S. tax consequences to them from the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Series 2015 Bonds 
in light of their particular circumstances.   

U.S. Holders 

Interest.  Interest on the Series 2015 Bonds generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary 
interest income at the time such amounts are accrued or received, in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s method 
of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

To the extent that the issue price of any maturity of the Series 2015 Bonds is less than the amount to 
be paid at maturity of such Series 2015 Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least 
annually  over  the  term  of  such  Series  2015  Bonds),  the  difference  may  constitute  original  issue  discount 
(“OID”).    U.S.  Holders  of  Series  2015  Bonds  will  be  required  to  include  OID  in  income  for  U.S.  federal 
income tax purposes as it accrues, in accordance with a constant yield method based on a compounding of 
interest (which may be before the receipt of cash payments attributable to such income).  Under this method, 
U.S.  Holders  generally  will  be  required  to  include  in  income  increasingly  greater  amounts  of  OID  in 
successive accrual periods. 

Series 2015 Bonds purchased for an amount in excess of the principal amount payable at maturity (or, 
in some cases, at their earlier call date) will be treated as issued at a premium.  A U.S. Holder of a Series 2015 
Bond issued at a premium may make an election, applicable to all debt securities purchased at a premium by 
such U.S. Holder, to amortize such premium, using a constant yield method over the term of such Series 2015 
Bond. 

Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Series 2015 Bonds.  Unless a non-recognition provision of 
the Code applies, the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement (including pursuant to an offer by the Authority or 
other disposition of a Series 2015 Bond will be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  In such 
event,  in  general,  a  U.S.  Holder  of  a  Series  2015  Bond  will  recognize  gain  or  loss  equal  to  the  difference 
between (i) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of property received (except to the extent attributable 
to accrued but unpaid interest on the Series 2015 Bond, which will be taxed in the manner described above) 
and  (ii)  the  U.S.  Holder’s  adjusted  U.S.  federal  income  tax  basis  in  the  Series  2015  Bond  (generally,  the 
purchase price paid by the U.S. Holder for the Series 2015 Bond, decreased by any amortized premium, and 
increased by the amount of any OID previously included in income by such U.S. Holder with respect to such 
Series 2015 Bond). Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss.  In the case of a non-corporate 
U.S. Holder of the Series 2015 Bonds, the maximum marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to any 
such gain will be lower than the maximum marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income 
if such U.S. holder’s holding period for the Series 2015 Bonds exceeds one year.  The deductibility of capital 
losses is subject to limitations. 

 

59 

 

Defeasance of the Taxable Bonds.  If the Authority defeases any Series 2015 Bond, the Series 2015 
Bond may be deemed to be retired and “reissued” for federal income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance. 
In that event, in general, a holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the 
amount realized from the deemed sale, exchange or retirement (less any accrued qualified stated interest which 
will be taxable as such) and (ii) the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Series 2015 Bond. 

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.  Payments on the Series 2015 Bonds generally will 
be subject to U.S. information reporting and possibly to “backup withholding.”  Under Section 3406 of the 
Code and applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, a non-corporate U.S. Holder of the Series 
2015  Bonds  may  be  subject  to  backup  withholding  at  the  current  rate  of  28%  with  respect  to  “reportable 
payments,” which include interest paid on the Series 2015 Bonds and the gross proceeds of a sale, exchange, 
redemption, retirement or other disposition of the Series 2015 Bonds.  The payor will be required to deduct and 
withhold the prescribed amounts if (i) the payee fails to furnish a U.S. taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) 
to  the  payor  in  the  manner  required,  (ii)  the  IRS  notifies  the  payor  that  the  TIN  furnished  by  the  payee  is 
incorrect, (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code or 
(iv) the payee fails to certify under penalty of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding under Section 
3406(a)(1)(C)  of  the  Code.    Amounts  withheld  under  the  backup  withholding  rules  may  be  refunded  or 
credited against the U.S. Holder’s federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is 
timely  furnished  to  the  IRS.    Certain  U.S.  holders  (including  among  others,  corporations  and  certain  tax-
exempt organizations) are not subject to backup withholding.  A holder’s failure to comply with the backup 
withholding rules may result in the imposition of penalties by the IRS. 

Non-U.S. Holders 

Interest.   Subject  to  the discussions below  under  the headings  “Information  Reporting and  Backup 
Withholding” and “FATCA,” payments of principal of, and interest on, any Series 2015 Bond to a Non-U.S. 
Holder, other than (1) a controlled foreign corporation, as such term is defined in the Code, which is related to 
the Authority through stock ownership and (2) a bank which acquires such Series 2015 Bond in consideration 
of an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business, 
will not be subject to any U.S. federal withholding tax provided that the beneficial owner of the Series 2015 
Bond provides a certification completed in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, 
which requirements are discussed below under the heading “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,” 
or an exemption is otherwise established.  

Disposition  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds.    Subject  to  the  discussions  below  under  the  headings 
“Information  Reporting  and  Backup  Withholding”  and  “FATCA,”  any  gain  realized  by  a  Non-U.S.  Holder 
upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement (including pursuant to an offer by the Authority or a deemed 
retirement due to defeasance of the Series 2015 Bond) or other disposition of a Series 2015 Bond generally 
will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, unless (i) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by 
such Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business within the United States; or (ii) in the case of any gain realized by 
an individual Non-U.S. Holder, such holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable 
year of such sale, exchange, redemption, retirement (including pursuant to an offer by the Authority) or other 
disposition and certain other conditions are met. 

U.S. Federal Estate Tax.  A Series 2015 Bond that is held by an individual who at the time of death is 
not a citizen or resident of the United States will not be subject to U.S. federal estate tax as a result of such 
individual’s death, provided that, at the time of such individual’s death, payments of interest with respect to 
such Series 2015 Bond would not have been effectively connected with the conduct by such individual of a 
trade or business within the United States. 

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.  Subject to the discussion below under the heading 
“FATCA,” under current U.S. Treasury Regulations, payments of principal and interest on any Series 2015 
Bonds  to  a  holder  that  is  not  a  United  States  person  will  not  be  subject  to  any  backup  withholding  tax 

 

60 

 

requirements if the beneficial owner of the Series 2015 Bond or a financial institution holding the Series 2015 
Bond on behalf of the beneficial owner in the ordinary course of its trade or business provides an appropriate 
certification  to  the  payor  and  the payor does not  have  actual knowledge  that the certification  is  false.    If  a 
beneficial owner provides the certification, the certification must give the name and address of such owner, 
state that such owner is not a United States person, or, in the case of an individual, that such owner is neither a 
citizen nor a resident of the United States, and the owner must sign the certificate under penalties of perjury.  
The current backup withholding tax rate is 28%. 

Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”)—U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders   

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, impose a 30% withholding tax on certain types of payments 
made to foreign financial institutions, unless the foreign financial institution enters into an agreement with the 
U.S.  Treasury  to,  among  other  things,  undertake  to  identify  accounts  held  by  certain  U.S.  persons  or  U.S.-
owned entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to 
account  holders  whose  actions  prevent  it  from  complying  with  these  and  other  reporting  requirements,  or 
unless  the  foreign  financial  institution  is  otherwise  exempt  from  those  requirements.    In  addition,  FATCA 
imposes  a  30%  withholding  tax  on  the same  types  of  payments  to a  non-financial  foreign entity  unless  the 
entity certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or the entity furnishes identifying information 
regarding  each  substantial  U.S.  owner.    Failure  to  comply  with  the  additional  certification,  information 
reporting and other specified requirements imposed under FATCA could result in the 30% withholding tax 
being imposed on payments of interest and principal under the Series 2015 Bonds and sales proceeds of Series 
2015 Bonds held by or through a foreign entity.  In general, withholding under FATCA currently applies to 
payments of U.S. source interest (including OID) and, under current Treasury Regulations, will apply to (i) 
gross proceeds from the sale, exchange or retirement of debt obligations paid after December 31, 2016 and (ii) 
certain  “pass-thru”  payments  no  earlier  than  January  1,  2017.    However,  the  U.S.  Treasury  Department 
recently stated its intention to revise the current U.S. Treasury Regulations regarding FATCA to provide that 
withholding under FATCA generally will apply to (i) gross proceeds from the sale, exchange or retirement of 
debt obligations paid after December 31, 2018 and (ii) certain “pass-thru” payments no earlier than January 1, 
2019.  Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding FATCA and its effect on them.  

The  foregoing  summary  is  included  herein  for  general  information  only  and  does  not  discuss  all 
aspects of U.S. federal taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder of Series 2015 Bonds in light of the 
holder’s particular circumstances and income tax situation.  Prospective investors are urged to consult their 
own tax advisors as to any tax consequences to them from the purchase, ownership and disposition of Series 
2015 Bonds, including the application and effect of state, local, non-U.S., and other tax laws. 

The  form  of  Bond  Counsel’s  proposed  opinion  with  respect  to  the  Series  2015  Bonds  is  attached 

hereto in Appendix C. 

FINANCIAL ADVISOR 

The  City  has  retained  Fieldman  Rolapp  &  Associates,  Inc.,  Irvine,  California  (the  “Financial 
Advisor”) as financial advisor in connection with the sale of the Series 2015 Bonds.  The Financial Advisor is 
not  obligated  to  undertake,  and  has  not  undertaken  to  make,  an  independent  verification  or  to  assume  any 
responsibility  for  the  accuracy,  completeness  or  fairness  of  the  information  contained  in  this  Official 
Statement. 

The  Financial  Advisor  is  an  independent  advisory  firm  and  is  not  engaged  in  the  business  of 

underwriting, trading or distributing municipal or other public securities.

CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS 

The  validity  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds  and  certain  other  legal  matters  are  subject  to  the  approving 
opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Los Angeles, Bond Counsel.  A complete copy of the proposed 
form of Bond Counsel opinion is contained in Appendix C.  Bond Counsel and counsel to the Underwriter will 
receive compensation from the City contingent upon the sale and delivery of the Series 2015 Bonds.  Certain 
legal matters will be passed upon for the City and the Authority by Quintanilla & Associates, a Professional 
Corporation,  Interim  City  Attorney  and  interim  counsel  to  the  Authority,  for  the  Underwriter  by  Stradling 
Yocca Carlson & Rauth, a Professional Corporation, Newport Beach, California, and for the Trustee by its 
counsel.   

ABSENCE OF LITIGATION 

To the best knowledge of the City and the Authority, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending or 
threatened  either  restraining  or  enjoining  the  execution  or  delivery  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds,  the  Facilities 
Lease, the Facilities Sublease or the Trust Agreement, or in any way contesting or affecting the validity of the 
foregoing or any proceedings of the Authority or the City taken with respect to any of the foregoing.  There are 
a  number  of  lawsuits  and  claims  from  time  to  time  pending  against  the  City.    In  the  opinion  of  the  City 
Attorney, and taking into account likely insurance coverage and litigation reserves, there are no lawsuits or 
claims pending against the City that will materially affect the City’s finances so as to impair its ability to pay 
Base Rental Payments when due. 

UNDERWRITING 

The  Series  2015  Bonds  are  being  purchased  by  Stifel,  Nicolaus  &  Company,  Incorporated  (the 
“Underwriter”).    The  Underwriter  will  purchase  the  Series  2015  Bonds  from  the  Authority  at  an  aggregate 
purchase price of $10,320,498.00, representing the principal amount of the Series 2015 Bonds, less $41,707.00 
of original issue discount and less $67,795.00 of Underwriter’s discount. 

The initial public offering prices stated on the inside front cover of this Official Statement may be 
changed from time to time by the Underwriter.  The Underwriter may offer and sell the Series 2015 Bonds to 
certain dealers (including dealers depositing Series 2015 Bonds into investment trusts), dealer banks, banks 
acting as agents and others at prices lower than said public offering prices. 

RATINGS 

S&P is expected to assign the Series 2015 Bonds the rating of “AA” based upon the delivery of the 
Policy by AGM at the time of issuance of the Series 2015 Bonds.  S&P is also expected to assign the Series 
2015 Bonds the rating of “A+” notwithstanding the delivery of the Policy.  There is no assurance that any 
credit rating given to the Series 2015 Bonds will be maintained for any period of time or that the ratings may 
not be lowered  or  withdrawn  entirely  by  S&P  if,  in  the  judgment  of  S&P,  circumstances  so warrant.    Any 
downward revision or withdrawal of the ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series 
2015 Bonds.  The ratings reflect only the views of S&P, and an explanation of the significance of such ratings 
may  be  obtained  from  S&P.    Generally,  a  rating  agency  bases  its  ratings  on  the  information  and  materials 
furnished to it and on investigations, studies and assumptions of its own. 

None  of  the  Authority,  the  City  or  the  Underwriter  makes  any  representation  as  to  AGM’s 
creditworthiness and no representation that AGM’s credit rating will be maintained in the future.  S&P has 
previously taken action to downgrade the ratings of certain municipal bond insurers and has published various 
releases outlining the processes that S&P intends to follow in evaluating the ratings of financial guarantors.  
For some financial guarantors, the result of such evaluations could be a rating affirmation, a change in rating 
outlook,  a  review  for  downgrade  or  a  downgrade.    Potential  investors  are  directed  to  S&P  for  additional 

 

62 

 

information  on  S&P’s  evaluations  of  the  financial  guaranty  industry  and  individual  financial  guarantors, 
including AGM.  See the caption “BOND INSURANCE” for further information relating to AGM. 

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE 

Pursuant to a Continuing Disclosure Certificate of the City, dated as of the date of issuance of the 
Series 2015 Bonds (the “Disclosure Certificate”), the City has covenanted for the benefit of the holders and 
Beneficial  Owners  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds  to  provide  certain  financial  information  and  operating  data 
relating to the District by 270 days following the end of the City Fiscal Year (currently its Fiscal Year ends on 
June 30) (the “Annual Report”), commencing with the report for the Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2015, and to 
provide  notices  of  the  occurrence  of  certain  enumerated  events.    The  Annual  Report  and  the  notices  of 
enumerated  events  will  be  filed  by  the  City  with  the  Municipal  Securities  Rulemaking  Board’s  Electronic 
Municipal Market Access system, maintained on the Internet at http://emma.msrb.org.  The specific nature of 
the information to be contained in the Annual Report and the notices of enumerated events are set forth in 
Appendix D.  These covenants have been made in order to assist the Underwriter in complying with subsection 
(b)(5) of Rule 15c2-12 adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Rule 15c2-12”).   

The requirement that the City file its audited financial statements as a part of the Annual Report has 
been included in the Disclosure Certificate solely to satisfy the provisions of Rule 15c2-12.  The inclusion of 
such information does not mean that the Series 2015 Bonds are secured by any resources or property of the 
City  or  any  entity  other  than  Base  Rental  Payments.    See  the  captions  “SECURITY  AND  SOURCES  OF 
PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES 2015 BONDS” and “RISK FACTORS—General Considerations – Security 
for the Series 2015 Bonds.”   

The City and its related entities have previously entered into continuing disclosure undertakings under 
Rule 15c2-12 in connection with the issuance of municipal obligations.  In the past five years, the City and its 
related  entities  failed  to  file  certain  event  notices  required  by  their  respective  continuing  disclosure 
undertakings on a timely basis relating to bond insurer rating downgrades of which the City was unaware.  The 
City has filed a corrective notice regarding such bond insurer rating downgrades.  In addition, the City filed a 
notice of defeasance of the Authority’s 2005 Lease Revenue Bonds in July 2015, approximately 9 months after 
the defeasance of such obligations. 

The  City  filed  its  Fiscal  Year  2010  audited  financial  statements  and  continuing  disclosure  annual 
report (the “FY 2010 CDAR”) in connection with the Moreno Valley Public Financing Authority 1997 Lease 
Revenue Bonds (the “1997 Bonds”) after the date by which such information was required to be filed pursuant 
to the continuing disclosure undertaking for the 1997 Bonds.  In addition, the FY 2010 CDAR did not include 
updates of certain Fiscal Year 2010 information that was required to be updated pursuant to the continuing 
disclosure undertaking for the 1997 Bonds. 

In order to promote compliance by the City and its related entities, including the Authority and the 
Former  Agency,  with  their  respective  continuing  disclosure  undertakings,  the  City  has  retained  Willdan 
Financial Services (“Willdan”) to serve as dissemination agent and assist such entities in complying with their 
continuing  disclosure  obligations.    Willdan  will  also  perform  these  duties  for  the  land-secured  financings 
involving  the  City’s  community  facilities  districts.    Additionally  the  City  has  taken  the  steps  to  amend  its 
existing  debt policy,  which  has  been  approved  by  the  City  Council,  to  ensure  future  compliance  with  Rule 
15c2-12. 

Except  as  disclosed  above,  the  City  has  not  in  the  past  five  years  failed  to  comply  with  such 

continuing disclosure undertakings in any material respect.

applicable, does not adversely affect the City’s use and occupancy of the Facilities.

With respect to the substitution of property, a Written Certificate of the City stating that the
useful life of the property to be substituted is at least equal to the useful life of the property

addition, substitution or withdrawal, as the case may be, (i) is authorized or permitted under
the Facilities Sublease; (ii) will, upon the execution and delivery thereof, be valid and binding
upon the Authority and the City; and (iii) will not cause the interest on any tax-exempt Bonds
to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.

The Facilities or portion thereof for which other real property is substituted, pursuant to the Facilities
Sublease, shall be released from the Facilities Lease and the Facilities Sublease, and shall no longer be

Facilities under the Facilities Sublease or Facilities Lease shall be subject to the prior written consent of AGM.

performance or enforcement of the Facilities Sublease or any assignment thereof, the Trust Agreement, the
Authority’s interest in the Facilities and the lease of the Facilities to the City, including but not limited to

time, together with a statement certifying that the amount billed has been paid by the Authority or by the
Trustee on behalf of the Authority, for one or more of the items above described, or that such amount is then

The Authority may in the future issue bonds to finance facilities, and may in the future enter into
leases with respect to other facilities. The administrative costs of the Authority shall be allocated among such
other facilities and the Facilities as provided in the Facilities Sublease.

Payments to be Unconditional

Each Base Rental Payment installment or Additional Payment payable under the Facilities Sublease
shall be paid in lawful money of the United States of America to or upon the order of the Authority at the
corporate trust office of the Trustee or such other place as the Authority shall designate. Any such Base Rental
Payment installment or Additional Payment accruing under the Facilities Sublease which shall not be paid
when due and payable under the terms of the Facilities Sublease shall bear interest at the rate of 12% per
annum, or such lesser rate of interest as may be the maximum rate permitted by law, from the date when the
same is due under the Facilities Sublease until the same shall be paid (provided that the foregoing shall not
apply to payments following an abatement). Notwithstanding any dispute between the Authority and the City,
the City shall make all Base Rental Payments, Additional Payments and other payments when due without
deduction or offset of any kind and shall not withhold any rental or other payments pending the final resolution
of such dispute. In the event of a determination that the City was not liable for said payments or any portion
thereof, said payments or excess of payments, as the case may be, shall be credited against subsequent
payments due under the Facilities Sublease or refunded at the time of such determination. Amounts required
to be deposited by the City with the Trustee pursuant to the Facilities Sublease for payment of Base Rental
Payments on any date shall be reduced to the extent of amounts on deposit in the Revenue Fund and available

Appropriations Covenant; Lease Obligation Not a Debt

The City covenants to take such action as may be necessary to include all such Base Rental Payments
and Additional Payments due under the Facilities Sublease in its annual budgets, and to make necessary annual
appropriations for all such Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments. The City will deliver to the
Authority copies of the portion of each annual City budget relating to the payment of Base Rental Payments
and Additional Payments under the Facilities Sublease within 30 days after the filing or adoption thereof.

The Authority and the City understand and intend that the obligation of the City to pay Base Rental
Payments and Additional Payments under the Facilities Sublease shall constitute a current expense of the City
and shall not in any way be construed to be a debt of the City in contravention of any applicable constitutional
or statutory limitation or requirement concerning the creation of indebtedness by the City, nor shall anything
contained in the Facilities Sublease constitute a pledge of the general tax revenues, funds or moneys of the
City, Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments due under the Facilities Sublease shall be payable only
from current funds which are budgeted and appropriated or otherwise legally available for the purpose of
paying Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments or other payments due under the Facilities Sublease as
consideration for the use of the Facilities. The City has not pledged the full faith and credit of the City, the
State or any agency or department thereof to the payment of the Base Rental Payments and Additional
Payments or any other payments due under the Facilities Sublease.

Rental Abatement

The Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments shall be abated proportionately, during any
period in which by reason of any material damage or destruction (other than by condemnation) there is
substantial interference with the use and occupancy of the Facilities by the City, in the proportion in which the
cost of that portion of the Facilities rendered unusable bears to the cost of the whole of the Facilities. Such
abatement shall continue for the period commencing with such damage or destruction and ending with the
substantial completion of the work of repair or reconstruction. In the event of any such damage or destruction,
the Facilities Sublease shall continue in full force and effect and the City waives the benefits of California
Civil Code Section 1932(2) and 1933(4) and of Title 11 of the United States Code, Section 365(h) and any and
all other rights to terminate the Facilities Sublease by virtue of any such damage or destruction or interference.

Fire and Extended Coverage; Use of Insurance Proceeds

The City shall procure or cause to be procured and maintain or cause to be maintained, throughout the
term of the Facilities Sublease, insurance against loss or damage to any structures constituting any part of the
Facilities by fire and lightning, with extended coverage insurance, vandalism and malicious mischief insurance
and sprinkler system leakage insurance. Said extended coverage insurance shall, as nearly as practicable,
cover loss or damage by explosion, windstorm, riot, aircraft, vehicle damage, smoke and such other hazards as
are normally covered by such insurance. Such insurance shall be in an amount equal to the replacement cost
(without deduction for depreciation) of all structures constituting any part of the Facilities, excluding the cost
of excavations, of grading and filling, and of the land, or, in the alternative, shall be in an amount and in a form
sufficient, in the event of total or partial loss, to enable all Bonds then Outstanding to be redeemed.

As an alternative to providing the insurance required by the paragraph above, or any portion thereof,
the City may provide a self-insurance method or plan of protection if and to the extent such self-insurance
method or plan of protection shall afford reasonable protection to the Authority, the Holders and the Trustee, in
light of all circumstances, giving consideration to cost, availability and similar plans or methods of protection
adopted by public entities in the State other than the City. Before such other method or plan may be provided
by the City, and annually thereafter so long as such method or plan is being provided to satisfy the
requirements of the Facilities Sublease, there shall be filed with the Trustee a certificate of an Insurance
Consultant or other qualified person, stating that, in the opinion of the signer, the substitute method or plan of
protection is in accordance with the requirements of the paragraph above and, when effective, would afford
reasonable protection to the Authority, its members, directors, officers, agents and employees and the Trustee

A-10

against loss and damage from the hazards and risks covered thereby. There shall also be filed a certificate of
the City setting forth the details of such substitute method or plan.

In the event of any damage to or destruction of any part of the Facilities caused by the perils covered
by such insurance, the Authority, except as hereinafter provided, shall cause the proceeds of such insurance to
be used for the repair, reconstruction or replacement of the damaged or destroyed portion of the Facilities, and
the Trustee shall hold said proceeds separate and apart from all other funds in a special fund to be designated
the “Insurance and Condemnation Fund,” to the end that such proceeds shall be applied to the repair,
reconstruction or replacement of the Facilities to at least the same good order, repair and condition as it was in
prior to the damage or destruction, insofar as the same may be accomplished by the use of said proceeds. The
Trustee shall withdraw said proceeds from time to time upon receiving the Written Request of the Authority,
stating that the Authority has expended moneys or incurred liabilities in an amount equal to the amount therein
requested to be paid over to it for the purpose of repair, reconstruction or replacement, and specifying the items
for which such moneys were expended, or such liabilities were incurred, and containing the additional
information required to be included in a Written Request of the Authority prepared pursuant to the Trust
Agreement. Any balance of said proceeds not required for such repair, reconstruction or replacement shall be
transferred to the Trustee and treated by the Trustee as Base Rental Payments and applied in the manner
provided by the Trust Agreement. Alternatively, if the proceeds of such insurance, together with any other
moneys then available for the purpose, are at least sufficient to redeem an aggregate principal amount of
Outstanding Bonds equal to the amount of Outstanding Bonds attributable to the portion of the Facilities so
destroyed or damaged, the City may elect not to repair, reconstruct or replace the damaged or destroyed
portion of the Facilities and thereupon shall cause said proceeds to be used for the redemption of Outstanding
Bonds pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement.

The Authority and the City shall promptly apply for federal disaster aid or State disaster aid for which
either may be eligible in the event that the Facilities are damaged or destroyed as a result of an earthquake or
other declared disaster occurring at any time. Any proceeds received as a result of such disaster aid shall be
used to repair, reconstruct, restore or replace the damaged or destroyed portions of the Facilities, or to redeem
Outstanding Bonds if such use of such disaster aid is permitted.

Liability Insurance

Except as hereinafter provided, the City shall procure or cause to be procured and maintain or cause to
be maintained, throughout the term of the Facilities Sublease, a standard comprehensive general liability
insurance policy or policies in protection of the Authority and its members, directors, officers, agents and
employees and the Trustee, indemnifying said parties against all direct or contingent loss or liability for
damages for personal injury, death or property damage occasioned by reason of the operation of the Facilities,
with minimum liability limits of $1,000,000 for personal injury or death of each person and $3,000,000 for
personal injury or deaths of two or more persons in each accident or event, and in a minimum amount of
$200,000 for damage to property resulting from each accident or event. Such public liability and property
damage insurance may, however, be in the form of a single limit policy in the amount of $3,000,000 covering
all such risks. Such liability insurance may be maintained as part of or in conjunction with any other liability
insurance carried by the City.

As an alternative to providing liability insurance, or any portion thereof, the City may provide a
self-insurance method or plan of protection if and to the extent such self-insurance method or plan of
protection shall afford reasonable protection to the Authority, its members, directors, officers, agents and
employees and the Trustee, in light of all circumstances, giving consideration to cost, availability and similar
plans or methods of protection adopted by public entities in the State other than the City. Before such other
method or plan may be provided by the City, and annually thereafter so long as such method or plan is being
provided to satisfy the requirements of the Facilities Sublease, there shall be filed with the Trustee a certificate
of an Insurance Consultant or other qualified person, stating that, in the opinion of the signer, the substitute
method or plan of protection is in accordance with the requirements of the Facilities Sublease and, when
effective, would afford reasonable protection to the Authority, its members, directors, officers, agents and

A-11

employees and the Trustee against loss and damage from the hazards and risks covered thereby. There shall
also be filed a certificate of the City setting forth the details of such substitute method or plan.

Rental Interruption or Use and Occupancy Insurance

The City shall procure or cause to be procured and maintain or cause to be maintained throughout the
term of the Facilities Sublease, rental interruption or use and occupancy insurance to cover loss, total or partial,
of the rental income from or the use of the Facilities as the result of any of the hazards covered by fire and
extended coverage insurance, in an amount sufficient to pay the maximum annual Base Rental Payments for
any two year period except that such insurance may be subject to a deductible clause as set forth in Facilities
Sublease. Any proceeds of such insurance shall be used by the Trustee to reimburse to the City any rental
theretofore paid by the City under the Facilities Sublease attributable to such structure for a period of time
during which the payment of rental under the Facilities Sublease is abated, and any proceeds of such insurance
not so used shall be applied as provided in the Facilities Sublease (to the extent required for the payment of
Base Rental Payments and for the payment of Additional Payments).

Eminent Domain

If the whole of the Facilities or so much thereof as to render the remainder unusable for the purposes
for which it was used by the City shall be taken under the power or threat of eminent domain, the term of the
Facilities Sublease shall cease as of the day that possession shall be so taken.
If less than the whole of the
Facilities shall be taken under the power or threat of eminent domain and the remainder is usable for the
purposes for which it was used by the City at the time of such taking, then the Facilities Sublease shall
continue in full force and effect as to such remainder, and the parties waive the benefits of any law to the
contrary, and in such event there shall be a partial abatement of the rental due in an amount equivalent to the
amount by which the annual payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds then Outstanding will be
reduced by the application of the award in eminent domain to the redemption of Outstanding Bonds. So long
as any of the Bonds shall be Outstanding, any award made in eminent domain proceedings for taking the
Facilities or any portion thereof shall be paid to the Trustee and applied to the prepayment of the Base Rental
Payments as provided in the Facilities Sublease. Any such award made after all of the Base Rental Payments
and Additional Payments have been fully paid, or provision therefor made, shall be paid to the City.

Defaults and Remedies

(A)

If the City shall fail to pay any Base Rental Payment, Additional Payment or other amount
payable under the Facilities Sublease when the same becomes due and payable, time being expressly declared
to be of the essence of the Facilities Sublease, or the City shall fail to keep, observe or perform any other term,
covenant or condition contained in the Facilities Sublease or in the Trust Agreement to be kept or performed
by the City for a period of 30 days after notice of the same has been given to the City by the Authority or the
Trustee or for such additional time as is reasonably required, in the discretion of the Trustee, to correct the
same, or upon the happening of any of the events specified in paragraph (B), below (any such case above being
an “Event of Default”), the City shall be deemed to be in default under the Facilities Sublease and it shall be
lawful for the Authority to exercise any and all remedies available pursuant to law or granted pursuant to the
Facilities Sublease. Upon any such default, the Authority, in addition to all other rights and remedies it may
have at law, may do any of the following:

(1)

To terminate the Facilities Sublease in the manner hereinafter provided on account of
default by the City, notwithstanding any re-entry or re-letting of the Facilities as hereinafter provided for in
subparagraph (2) below, and to re-enter the Facilities and remove all persons in possession thereof and all
personal property whatsoever situated upon the Facilities and place such personal property in storage in any
warehouse or other suitable place located within the City.

Without terminating the Facilities Sublease, (i) to collect each Base Rental Payment
installment and other amounts as they become due and enforce any other terms or provision of the Facilities

(2)

A-12

Sublease to be kept or performed by the City, regardless of whether or not the City has abandoned the
Facilities, or (ii) to exercise any and all rights of re-entry upon the Facilities.

In addition to the other remedies set forth in the Facilities Sublease, upon the occurrence of an event of default
as described therein, the Authority shall proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in the Authority by the
Facilities Sublease or by law. The provisions of the Facilities Sublease and the duties of the City and of its
trustees, officers or employees shall be enforceable by the Authority by mandamus or other appropriate suit,
action or proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Authority may bring the following actions:

1.

2.

3.

Accounting. By action or suit in equity to require the City and its trustees, officers and
employees and its assigns to account as the trustee of an express trust.

Injunction. By action or suit in equity to enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or
in violation of the rights of the Authority.

Mandamus. By mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity to enforce
the Authority’s rights against the City (and its council, officers and employees) and to compel
the City to perform and carry out its duties and obligations under the law and its covenants
and agreements with the Authority as provided in the Facilities Sublease.

The exercise of any rights or remedies under the Facilities Sublease shall not permit acceleration of Base
Rental Payments.

Each and all of the remedies given to the Authority under the Facilities Sublease or by any law are
cumulative and the single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under the Facilities Sublease shall
not impair the right of the Authority to other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any or all other
rights, powers or privileges. The term “re-let” or “re-letting” shall include, but not be limited to, re-letting by
means of the operation by the Authority of the Facilities. If any statute or rule of law validly shall limit the
remedies given to the Authority under the Facilities Sublease, the Authority nevertheless shall be entitled to
whatever remedies are allowable under any statute or rule of law.

Subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement, so long as the Bond Insurer shall not have defaulted
under the Bond Insurance Policy, the Bond Insurer shall have the right to control all remedies for default under
the Facilities Lease, the Facilities Sublease and the Trust Agreement.

Prepayment

(A)

The City shall prepay on any date from insurance and eminent domain proceeds, to the extent
provided in the Facilities Sublease (provided, however, that in the event of partial damage to or destruction of
the Facilities caused by perils covered by insurance, if in the judgment of the Authority the insurance proceeds
are sufficient to repair, reconstruct or replace the damaged or destroyed portion of the Facilities, such proceeds
shall be held by the Trustee and used to repair, reconstruct or replace the damaged or destroyed portion of the
Facilities, pursuant to the procedure set forth in the Facilities Sublease for proceeds of insurance), all or any
part (in an integral multiple of $5,000 principal component) of Base Rental Payments then unpaid so that the
aggregate annual amounts of Base Rental Payments which shall be payable after such prepayment date shall be
as nearly proportional as practicable to the aggregate annual amounts of Base Rental Payments unpaid prior to
the prepayment date, at a prepayment amount equal to the principal of and interest on the Bonds to the date of
redemption of the Bonds.

(B)

The City may prepay, from any source of available funds, all or any portion of Base Rental
Payments by (i) depositing with the Trustee moneys or securities as provided in the Trust Agreement sufficient
to retire or redeem Bonds corresponding to such Base Rental Payments when due or redeemable, and
(ii) satisfying the other requirements of the Trust Agreement. The City agrees that if following such

A-13

prepayment the Facilities are damaged or destroyed or taken by eminent domain, it is not entitled to, and by
such prepayment waives the right of, abatement of such prepaid Base Rental Payments and shall not be entitled
to any reimbursement of such Base Rental Payments.

(C)

Before making any prepayment pursuant to the Facilities Sublease, the City shall, within 5
days following the event creating such right or obligation to prepay, give written notice to the Authority and
the Trustee describing such event and specifying the date on which the prepayment will be made, which date
shall be not less than 60 days from the date such notice is given.

(D)

When (1) there shall have been deposited with the Trustee in trust for the benefit of the
Owners of the Bonds moneys or securities as described in the Trust Agreement sufficient to pay all principal of
and interest on the Bonds to the due date thereof or date when the City may exercise its option to purchase the
Facilities, and sufficient to pay in full all other amounts due under the Facilities Sublease or under the Trust
Agreement; (2) all of the requirements set forth in of the Trust Agreement have been satisfied; and (3) an
agreement shall have been entered into with the Trustee for the payment of its fees and expenses so long as any
of the Bonds shall remain unpaid; then and in that event the right, title and interest of the Authority in the
Facilities Sublease and the obligations of the City under the Facilities Sublease shall thereupon cease,
terminate, become void and be completely discharged and satisfied (except for the right of the Authority and
the obligation of the City to have such moneys and such Permitted Investments applied to the payment of the
Base Rental Payments or option price) and the Authority’s interest in and title to the Facilities or applicable
portion or item thereof shall be transferred and conveyed to the City. In such event, the Authority shall cause
an accounting for such period or periods as may be requested by the City to be prepared and filed with the
Authority (and accompanied by a verification report of a certified public accountant) and evidence such
discharge and satisfaction, and the Authority shall pay over to the City as an overpayment of Base Rental
Payments all such moneys or Permitted Investments held by it pursuant to the Facilities Sublease other than
such moneys and such Permitted Investments as are required for the payment or prepayment of the Base Rental
Payments or the option price and the fees and expenses of the Trustee, which moneys and Permitted
Investments shall continue to be held by the Trustee in trust for the payment of Base Rental Payments or the
option price and the fees and expenses of the Trustee, and shall be applied by the Authority to the payment and
redemption of the Bonds and the fees and expenses of the Trustee.

Option to Purchase; Sale of Personal Property

The City shall have the option to purchase the Authority’s interest in any part of the Facilities upon
payment of an option price consisting of moneys or Government Securities (not callable by the issuer thereof
prior to maturity) in an amount sufficient (together with the earnings and interest on such securities) to provide
funds to pay the aggregate amount for the entire remaining term of the Facilities Sublease of the part of the
total rent under the Facilities Sublease attributable to such part of the Facilities (determined by reference to the
proportion which the cost of such part of the Facilities bears to the cost of all of the Facilities). Any such
payment shall be made to the Trustee and shall be treated as Base Rental Payments and shall be applied by the
Trustee to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds and to redeem Bonds if such Bonds are subject to
redemption pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement. Upon the making of such payment to the Trustee
and the satisfaction of all requirements set forth in the Trust Agreement, (a) the Base Rental Payments
thereafter payable under the Facilities Sublease shall be reduced by the amount thereof attributable to such part
of the Facilities and paid in purchase of the Authority’s interest therein; (b) the rental abatement provisions
shall not thereafter be applicable to such part of the Facilities; (c) the insurance required by the Facilities
Sublease need not be maintained as to such part of the Facilities; and (d) title to such part of the Facilities shall
vest in the City and the term of the Facilities Sublease shall end as to such part of the Facilities.

The City, in its discretion may request the Authority to sell or exchange any personal property which
may at any time constitute a part of the Facilities, and to release said personal property from the Facilities
Sublease, if (a) in the opinion of the City the property so sold or exchanged is no longer required or useful in
connection with the operation of the Facilities; (b) the consideration to be received from the property is of a
value substantially equal to the value of the property to be released; and (c) if the value of any such property

A-14

shall, in the opinion of the Authority, exceed the amount of $25,000, the Authority shall have been furnished a
certificate of an independent engineer or other qualified independent professional consultant (satisfactory to
the Authority) certifying the value thereof and further certifying that such property is no longer required or
useful in connection with the operation of the Facilities. In the event of any such sale, the full amount of the
money or consideration received for the personal property so sold and released shall be paid to the Authority.
Any money so paid to the Authority may, so long as the City is not in default under any of the provisions of
the Facilities Sublease, be used upon the Written Request of the City to purchase personal property, which
property shall become a part of the Facilities leased under the Facilities Sublease. The Authority may require
such opinions, certificates and other documents as it may deem necessary before permitting any sale or
exchange of personal property subject to the Facilities Sublease or before releasing for the purchase of new
personal property money received by it for personal property so sold.

Liens

In the event the City shall at any time during the term of the Facilities Sublease cause any changes,
alterations, additions, improvements or other work to be done or performed or materials to be supplied, in or
upon the Facilities, the City shall pay, when due, all sums of money that may become due for, or purporting to
be for, any labor, services, materials, supplies or equipment furnished or alleged to have been furnished to or
for the City in, upon or about the Facilities and shall keep the Facilities free of any and all mechanics’ or
materialmen’s liens or other liens against the Facilities or the Authority’s interest therein.
In the event any
such lien attaches to or is filed against the Facilities or the Authority’s interest therein, the City shall cause
each such lien to be fully discharged and released at the time the performance of any obligation secured by any
such lien matures or becomes due, except that if the City desires to contest any such lien it may do so in good
faith. If any such lien shall be reduced to final judgment and such judgment or such process as may be issued
for the enforcement thereof is not promptly stayed, or if so stayed and said stay thereafter expires, the City
shall forthwith pay and discharge said judgment. The City agrees to and shall, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, indemnify and hold the Authority and the Trustee and their respective members, directors,
agents, successors and assigns, harmless from and against, and defend each of them against, any claim,
demand, loss, damage, liability or expense (including attorney’s fees) as a result of any such lien or claim of
lien against the Facilities or the Authority’s interest therein.

Authority Not Liable

The Authority and its members, directors, officers, agents, employees and assignees shall not be liable
to the City or to any other party whomsoever for any death, injury or damage that may result to any person or
property by or from any cause whatsoever in, on or about the Facilities.

The City, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify and hold the Authority and its members,
directors, officers, agents, employees and assignees, harmless from, and defend each of them against, any and
all claims, liens and judgments arising from (i) the construction or operation of the Facilities, including,
without limitation, death of or injury to any person or damage to property whatsoever occurring in, on or about
the Facilities regardless of responsibility for negligence, but excepting the active negligence of the person or
entity seeking indemnity, and (ii) the issuance of the Bonds and any other action of the Authority taken
pursuant to the Trust Agreement including, but not limited to, any liability of the Authority incurred pursuant
to the Trust Agreement.

Assignment and Subleasing

Neither the Facilities Sublease or any interest of the City thereunder may be mortgaged, pledged,
assigned, sublet or transferred by the City without the prior written consent of the Authority, and provided that
such subletting shall not cause interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax
purposes. No such mortgage, pledge, assignment, sublease or transfer shall in any event affect or reduce the
obligation of the City to make the Base Rental Payments and Additional Payments required thereunder.

A-15

Title to Facilities

During the term of the Facilities Sublease, the Authority shall hold leasehold title to the Facilities and
any and all additions which comprise fixtures, repairs, replacements or modifications thereof, except for those
fixtures, repairs, replacements or modifications which are added thereto by the City and which may be
removed without damaging the Facilities, and except for any items added to the Facilities by the City pursuant
to the Facilities Sublease. This provision shall not operate to the benefit of any insurance company if there is a
rental interruption covered by insurance pursuant to the Facilities Sublease. During the term of the Facilities
Sublease, the Authority shall have a leasehold interest in the Facilities pursuant to the Facilities Lease.

Upon the termination or expiration of the Facilities Sublease (other than as an Event of Default or a
governmental taking), title to the Facilities shall vest in the City pursuant to the Facilities Lease. Upon any
such termination or expiration, the Authority shall execute such conveyances, deeds and other documents as
may be necessary to effect such vesting of record.

Taxes

The City shall pay or cause to be paid all taxes and assessments of any type or nature charged to the
Authority or affecting the Facilities or the respective interests or estates therein. The City shall also pay
directly such amounts, if any, in each year as shall be required by the Authority for the payment of all license
and registration fees and all taxes (including, without limitation, income, excise, license, franchise, capital
stock, recording, sales, use, value-added, property, occupational, excess profits and stamp taxes), levies,
imposts, duties, charges, withholdings, assessments and governmental charges of any nature whatsoever,
together with any additions to tax, penalties, fines or interest thereon, including, without limitation, penalties,
fines or interest arising out of any delay or failure by the City to pay any of the foregoing or failure to file or
furnish to the Authority or the Trustee for filing in a timely manner any returns, levied or imposed against the
Authority or the Facilities, the rentals and other payments required under the Facilities Sublease, or any parts
thereof or interests of the City or the Authority or the Trustee therein by any governmental authority.

Purpose of Lease

The City covenants that during the term of the Facilities Sublease, (a) it will use, or cause the use of,
the Facilities for public purposes and for the purposes for which the Facilities are customarily used, (b) it will
not vacate or abandon the Facilities or any part thereof, and (c) it will not make any use of the Facilities which
would jeopardize in any way the insurance coverage required to be maintained pursuant to the Facilities
Sublease.

Continuing Disclosure Certificate

The City covenants that it will comply with and carry out all of the provisions of the Continuing
Disclosure Certificate. Although failure of the City to comply with the Continuing Disclosure Certificate shall
not be considered an Event of Default under the lease; the Trustee may (and, at the request of any Participating
Underwriter (as defined in the Continuing Disclosure Certificate) or the Holders of at least 25% aggregate
principal amount in Outstanding Bonds, shall) or any Bondholder or Beneficial Owner (as defined in the
Continuing Disclosure Certificate; see APPENDIX D to the Official Statement) may take such actions as may
be necessary and appropriate, including seeking specific performance by court order, to cause the City to
comply with its obligations.

Net-Net-Net Lease

The Facilities Sublease shall be deemed and construed to be a “net-net-net lease” and the City agrees
that the rentals and other payments provided for in the Facilities Sublease shall be an absolute net return to the
Authority, free and clear of any expenses, charges or set-offs whatsoever.

A-16

Provisions Concerning AGM and the 2015 Bond Insurance Policy

(A)

The City covenants and agrees, to the extent it may lawfully do so, that so long as any of the
Series 2015 Bonds remain outstanding and unpaid, the City will not exercise the power of condemnation with
respect to the Facilities. The City further covenants and agrees, to the extent it may lawfully do so, that if for
any reason the foregoing covenant is determined to be unenforceable or if the City should fail or refuse to
abide by such covenant and condemns the Facilities, the appraised value of the Facilities shall not be less that
the greater of (i) if such Series 2015 Bonds are then subject to redemption, the principal and interest
components of the Series 2015 Bonds outstanding through the date of their redemption, or (ii) if such Series
2015 Bonds are not then subject to redemption, the amount necessary to defease such Series 2015 Bonds to the
first available redemption date in accordance with the Trust Agreement.

(B)

The Lessee (under the Facilities Sublease) and the Lessor (under the Facilities Lease) shall

not have the right to terminate those agreements for default by the respective counterparties.

(C)

The City agrees to pay, or reimburse AGM, as Additional Payments for the use and
occupancy of the Facilities (subject to the provisions of the Facilities Sublease), any and all charges, fees, costs
and expenses that AGM may reasonably pay or incur in connection with (i) the administration, enforcement,
defense or preservation of any rights or security in any Related Document; (ii) the pursuit of any remedies
under the Trust Agreement, the Facilities Lease or the Facilities Sublease (each a “Related Document”) or
otherwise afforded by law or equity, (iii) any amendment, waiver or other action with respect to, or related to
any Related Document whether or not executed or completed, or (iv) any litigation or other dispute in
connection with any other Related Document or the transactions contemplated thereby, other than costs
resulting from the failure of AGM to honor its obligations under the 2015 Bond Insurance Policy. AGM
reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee as a condition to executing any amendment, waiver or consent
proposed in respect of any Related Document.

(D)

The City may only contest taxes, assessments, utility and other such charges with respect to
the Facilities upon notice to AGM and must pay such taxes, assessments, utility and other charges if requested
to do so by AGM.

Use of the Facilities

The City will not install, use, operate or maintain the Facilities improperly, carelessly, in violation of
any applicable law or in a manner contrary to that contemplated by the Facilities Sublease. The City shall
provide all permits and licenses, if any, necessary for the installation and operation of the Facilities.
In
addition, the City agrees to comply in all respects (including, without limitation, with respect to the use,
maintenance and operation of the Facilities) with all laws of the jurisdictions in which its operations may
extend and any legislative, executive, administrative or judicial body exercising any power or jurisdiction over
the Facilities; provided, however, that the City may contest in good faith the validity or application of any such
law or rule in any reasonable manner which does not adversely affect the estate of the Authority in and to the
Facilities or its interest or rights under the Facilities Sublease.

Amendment or Termination

The Authority and the City may at any time agree to the amendment or termination of the Facilities
Sublease; provided, however, that the Authority and the City agree and recognize that the Facilities Sublease is
entered into in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, and accordingly, that any such amendment

Agreement.

A-17

TRUST AGREEMENT

Certain provisions of the Trust Agreement setting forth the terms of the Bonds, the redemption
provisions thereof and the use of the proceeds of the Bonds are set forth elsewhere in this Official Statement.
See “THE SERIES 2015 BONDS,” and “SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES
2015 BONDS” herein.

The Trustee

Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, has been appointed by the Authority as Trustee. The Trustee
will receive all of the Bond proceeds and the Revenues for disbursement in conformity with the Trust
Agreement.
In addition, the Trustee will act as registrar of the Bonds. Payments of principal of, interest or
redemption premiums, if any, on the Bonds will be made through the principal corporate trust office of the
Trustee.

Assignment

The Authority assigns to the Trustee all of the Authority’s right, title and interest in the Facilities

Sublease and the Facilities Lease as security for payment of the Bonds.

Pledge of Revenues

All Revenues, any other amounts (including proceeds of the sale of the Bonds) held by the Trustee in
any fund or account established under the Trust Agreement (other than amounts on deposit in the Rebate Fund
created pursuant to the Trust Agreement) are irrevocably pledged to the payment of the interest and premium,
if any, on and principal of the Bonds as provided in the Trust Agreement, and the Revenues and other amounts
pledged under the Trust Agreement shall not be used for any other purpose while any of the Bonds remain
Outstanding; provided, however, that out of the Revenues and other moneys there may be applied such sums
for such purposes as are permitted under the Trust Agreement. This pledge shall constitute a pledge of and
charge and first lien upon the Revenues, all other amounts pledged under the Trust Agreement and all other
moneys on deposit in the funds and accounts established under the Trust Agreement (excluding amounts on
deposit in the Rebate Fund created pursuant to the Trust Agreement) for the payment of the interest on and
principal of the Bonds in accordance with the terms thereof and of the Trust Agreement.

Establishment of Funds and Accounts; Flow of Funds

The Trust Agreement provides for the establishment of the following special accounts or funds,
among others:
the Revenue Fund (within which the Interest Account and the Principal Account will be
established and maintained), the Costs of Issuance Fund, the Acquisition and Construction Fund and the
Rebate Fund. The Trustee will hold all funds in the Costs of Issuance Fund, the Revenue Fund and the Rebate
Fund; the City will hold all funds in the Acquisition and Construction Fund; and all other funds will be held by
the Treasurer of the Authority. All money in the Interest Account will be used and withdrawn by the Trustee
solely for the purpose of paying interest on the Bonds as it becomes due and payable (including accrued
interest on any Bonds purchased or redeemed prior to maturity). All money in the Principal Account will be
used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of paying the principal of the Bonds as it becomes
due and payable, whether at maturity or redemption. All money in the Costs of Issuance Fund will be used to
pay the Costs of Issuance of the Bonds upon receipt by the Treasurer of a Written Request of the Authority.
All moneys in the Acquisition and Construction Fund shall be applied by the City to the payment of Project
Costs and of expenses incident thereto (or for making reimbursements to the Authority or the City or any other
person, firm or corporation for such costs theretofore or thereafter paid by him or it), or shall be transferred to
the Trustee for the payment of debt service on the Bonds. Moneys in the Rebate Fund will be used to make
rebate payments to the United States of America, if required.

A-18

On each Principal Payment Date, following payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds, any
excess amount on deposit in the Revenue Fund shall be returned to the City as an excess of Base Rental
Payments.

Revenue Fund

Moneys in the Revenue Fund will be transferred to and deposited in the following respective accounts

in the following order of priority:

(1)

Interest Account. On or before each Interest Payment Date, the Trustee shall set aside from
the Revenue Fund and deposit in the Interest Account that amount of money which is equal to the amount of
interest becoming due and payable on all Outstanding Bonds on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.

No deposit need be made in the Interest Account if the amount contained therein and available to pay
interest on the Bonds is at least equal to the aggregate amount of interest becoming due and payable on all
Outstanding Bonds on such Interest Payment Date.

(2)

Principal Account. On or before each November 1, commencing November 1, 2016, the
Trustee shall set aside from the Revenue Fund and deposit in the Principal Account an amount of money equal
to the principal amount of all Outstanding Serial Bonds maturing on such November 1.

No deposit need be made in the Principal Account if the amount contained therein and available to pay
principal of the Bonds is at least equal to the aggregate amount of the principal of all Outstanding Serial Bonds
maturing by their terms on such November 1.

Investments

Subject to the Trust Agreement, all money held by the Trustee and the Treasurer in any of the
accounts or funds established pursuant to the Trust Agreement shall be invested in Permitted Investments at
the Written Request of the City or, if no instructions are received, in money market funds described in
paragraph 4 of the definition of Permitted Investments; provided, however, that any such investment shall be
made by the Trustee only if, prior to the date on which such investment is to be made, the Trustee shall have
received a Written Request of the City specifying a specific money market fund and, if no such Written
Request of the City is so received, the Trustee shall hold such moneys uninvested. Such investments shall, as
nearly as practicable, mature on or before the dates on which such money is anticipated to be needed for
disbursement under the Trust Agreement. For purposes of this restriction, Permitted Investments containing a
withdrawal option, repurchase option or put option by the investor shall be treated as having a maturity of no
longer than such option. Subject to the Trust Agreement, all interest or profits received on any money so
invested shall be deposited in the Revenue Fund. The Trustee and its affiliates may act as principal, agent,
sponsor or advisor with respect to any investments. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses on
investments made in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement.

Investments purchased with funds on deposit in the Revenue Fund shall mature not later than the

payment date or redemption date, as appropriate, immediately succeeding the investment.

Investments in any and all funds and accounts may be commingled for purposes of making, holding
and disposing of investments, notwithstanding provisions in the Trust Agreement for transfer to or holding in
particular funds and accounts amounts received or held by the Trustee under the Trust Agreement, provided
that the Trustee shall at all times account for such investments strictly in accordance with the funds and
accounts to which they are credited and otherwise as provided in the Trust Agreement.

A-19

Additional Bonds

The Authority may at any time issue Additional Bonds pursuant to a Supplemental Trust Agreement,
payable from the Revenues as provided in the Trust Agreement and secured by a pledge of and charge and lien
upon the Revenues as provided in the Trust Agreement equal to the pledge, charge and lien securing the
Outstanding Bonds theretofore issued under the Trust Agreement, but only subject to the following specific
conditions, which are made conditions precedent to the issuance of any such Additional Bonds:

1. The Authority shall be in compliance with all agreements and covenants contained in the

Trust Agreement and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

2. The Supplemental Trust Agreement shall require that the proceeds of the sale of such
Additional Bonds shall be applied to finance or refinance Projects, or for the refunding
or repayment of any Bonds then Outstanding, including the payment of costs and
expenses of and incident to the authorization and sale of such Additional Bonds. The
Supplemental Trust Agreement may also provide that a portion of such proceeds shall be
applied to the payment of the interest due or to become due on said Additional Bonds.

3. The aggregate principal amount of Bonds issued and at any time Outstanding under the
Trust Agreement shall not exceed any limit imposed by law, by the Trust Agreement or
by any Supplemental Trust Agreement.

4. The Facilities Sublease shall have been amended, if necessary, so that the Base Rental
Payments payable by the City thereunder in each Fiscal Year shall at least equal Debt
Service, including Debt Service on the Additional Bonds, in each Fiscal Year, and if Base
Rental Payments are being increased, a Certificate of the City shall be delivered to the
Trustee certifying that the annual fair rental value (which may be based on, but not
limited to, the construction or acquisition cost or replacement cost of any facility which is
or will become part of the Facilities) will be at least equal to 100% of the maximum
amount of Base Rental Payments becoming due in the then current fiscal year or in any
subsequent fiscal year.

5.

If additional facilities, if any, are to be leased and are not situated on property described
in the Facilities Lease and Facilities Sublease, (1) the Facilities Lease shall have been
amended so as to lease to the Authority such additional real property; and (2) the
Facilities Sublease shall have been amended so as to lease to the City such additional real
property.

6. The Reserve Fund is fully funded at the Reserve Fund Requirement (including the
proposed issue) upon the issuance of such Additional Bonds, in either case unless
otherwise permitted by the Bond Insurer.

Limitations on the Issuance of Obligations Payable from Revenues

The Authority will not, so long as any of the Bonds are Outstanding, issue any obligations or

securities, however denominated, payable in whole or in part from Revenues except the following:

(a) Bonds of any Series authorized pursuant to the Trust Agreement;

(b) Obligations which are junior and subordinate to the payment of the principal, premium
and interest on the Bonds and which subordinated obligations are payable as to principal, premium
and interest only out of Revenues after the prior payment of all amounts then required to be paid under
the Trust Agreement from Revenues for principal, premium and interest on the Bonds, as the same
become due and payable and at the times and in the manner as required in the Trust Agreement.

A-20

Covenant Against Encumbrances

The Authority will not make any pledge or assignment of or place any charge or lien upon the
Revenues except as provided in the Trust Agreement, and will not issue any bonds, notes or obligations
payable from the Revenues or secured by a pledge of or charge or lien upon the Revenues except as provided
in the Trust Agreement.

Tax Covenants

The Authority has covenanted to comply with all requirements of Sections 148 and 149(b) of the Code
to the extent applicable to the Bonds, and to not use or permit the use of any proceeds of the Bonds or any
funds of the Authority, directly or indirectly, in any manner, or to take or omit to take any action, that would
cause any of the Bonds to be treated as an obligation not described in Section 103(a) of the Code. In the event
that at any time the Authority is of the opinion that it is necessary to restrict or to limit the yield on the
investment of any moneys held by the Trustee under the Trust Agreement, the Authority shall so instruct the
Trustee in writing, and the Trustee shall take such action as may be necessary in accordance with such
instructions.

The Authority and the Trustee (as directed by the Authority) specifically covenant to comply with the
provisions and procedures of the Tax Certificate; provided that the Trustee shall not be bound by this covenant
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

No Tax Certificate will be delivered in connection with the Series 2015 Bonds, and the tax covenants

described under this heading are not applicable to the Series 2015 Bonds.

Application of Insurance Proceeds

In the event of any damage to or destruction of any part of the Facilities covered by insurance, the
Authority shall cause the proceeds of such insurance to be utilized for the repair, reconstruction or replacement
of the damaged or destroyed portion of the Facilities, and the Trustee shall hold said proceeds in a fund
established by the Trustee for such purpose separate and apart from all other funds, to the end that such
proceeds shall be applied to the repair, reconstruction or replacement of the Facilities to at least the same good
order, repair and condition as it was in prior to the damage or destruction, insofar as the same may be
accomplished by the use of said proceeds. The Trustee shall invest said proceeds in Permitted Investments
pursuant to the Request of the City, as agent for the Authority under the Facilities Sublease, and withdrawals
of said proceeds shall be made from time to time upon the filing with the Trustee of a Written Request of the
City, stating that the City has expended moneys or incurred liabilities in an amount equal to the amount therein
stated for the purpose of the repair, reconstruction or replacement of the Facilities, and specifying the items for
which such moneys were expended, or such liabilities were incurred, in reasonable detail. The City shall file a
Certificate of the City with the Trustee that sufficient funds from insurance proceeds or from any funds legally
available to the City, or from any combination thereof, are available in the event it elects to repair, reconstruct
or replace the Facilities. Any balance of such proceeds not required for such repair, reconstruction or
replacement and the proceeds of use and occupancy insurance shall be paid to the Trustee as Base Rental
Payments and applied in the manner provided by the Trust Agreement. Alternatively, the City, if the proceeds
of such insurance together with any other moneys then available for such purpose are sufficient to prepay all,
in case of damage or destruction in whole of the Facilities, or that portion, in the case of partial damage or
destruction of the Facilities, of the Base Rental Payments and all other amounts relating to the damaged or
destroyed portion of the Facilities, may elect not to repair, reconstruct or replace the damaged or destroyed
portion of the Facilities and thereupon shall cause said proceeds to be used for the redemption of Outstanding
Bonds pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Trust Agreement. The City shall not apply the proceeds of
insurance as set forth in this paragraph to redeem the Bonds in part due to damage or destruction of a portion
of the Facilities unless the Base Rental Payments on the undamaged portion of the Facilities will be sufficient
to pay the initially scheduled principal and interest on the Bonds remaining unpaid after such redemption.

A-21

Events of Default and Action on Default

The following events shall be “Events of Default”:

(a)

if default shall be made by the Authority in the due and punctual payment of the

interest on any Bond when and as the same shall become due and payable;

(b)

if default shall be made by the Authority in the due and punctual payment of the
principal of or redemption premium, if any, on any Bond when and as the same shall become due and
payable, whether at maturity as therein expressed or by proceedings for redemption;

(c)

if default shall be made by the Authority in the performance of any of the other
agreements or covenants required in the Trust Agreement to be performed by the Authority, and such
default shall have continued for a period of 30 days after the Authority shall have been given notice in
writing of such default by the Trustee;

(d)

if the Authority shall file a petition or answer seeking arrangement or reorganization
under the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law of the United States of America or any
state therein, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall approve a petition filed with or without the
consent of the Authority seeking arrangement or reorganization under the federal bankruptcy laws or
any other applicable law of the United States of America or any state therein, or if under the
provisions of any other law for the relief or aid of debtors any court of competent jurisdiction shall
assume custody or control of the Authority or of the whole or any substantial part of its property; or

(e)

if an Event of Default has occurred under the Facilities Sublease.

In each and every case during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee or the Owners of
not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding (subject to the
provisions of the Trust Agreement) shall be entitled, upon notice in writing to the City and the Authority to
exercise any of the remedies granted to the City under the Facilities Lease, to the Authority under the Facilities
Sublease, and in addition, to take whatever action at law or in equity may appear necessary or desirable to
enforce its rights or to protect and enforce any of the rights vested in the Trustee or the Owners by the Trust
Agreement or by the Bonds, either at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific
enforcement of any covenant or agreement or for the enforcement of any other legal or equitable right,
including any one or more of the remedies set forth in (a), (b) or (c) in the paragraph below. Anything in the
Trust Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default
as defined in the Trust Agreement, so long as the Bond Insurer is not in default under its Bond Insurance
Policy, the Bond Insurer shall be entitled to control and direct the enforcement of all rights and remedies
granted to the Owners or the Trustee for the benefit of the Owners under the Trust Agreement.

Other Remedies of the Trustee. The Trustee shall have the right: (a) by mandamus or other action or
proceeding or suit at law or in equity to enforce its rights against the City, the Authority or any director, officer
or employee thereof, and to compel the City or the Authority or any such director, officer or employee to
perform or carry out its or his or her duties under law and the agreements and covenants required to be
performed by it or him or her contained in the Trust Agreement; (b) by suit in equity to enjoin any acts or
things which are unlawful or violate the rights of the Trustee; or (c) by suit in equity upon the happening of
any default under the Trust Agreement to require the City and the Authority to account as the trustee of an
express trust.

Application of Funds After Default

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Trust Agreement, after a default by the
City, all funds and accounts held by the Trustee and all payments received by the Trustee with respect to the
rental of the Facilities after a default by the City pursuant to the Facility Sublease, and all damages or other

A-22

payments received by the Trustee for the enforcement of any rights and powers of the Trustee under the
Facility Sublease, shall be deposited into the Revenue Fund and as soon as practicable thereafter applied:

First, to the payment of the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the Trustee in providing for the
declaration of such event of default and carrying out its duties under the Trust Agreement, including
reasonable compensation to their accountants and counsel together with interest on any amounts advanced as
provided in the Trust Agreement and thereafter to the payment of the reasonable costs and expenses of the
Bondholders, if any, in carrying out the provisions of this section, including reasonable compensation to their
accountants and counsel; and

Second, upon presentation of the several Bonds, and the stamping thereon of the amount of the
payment if only partially paid or upon the surrender thereof if fully paid, to the payment of the whole amount
then owing and unpaid upon the Bonds for interest and principal, with (to the extent permitted by law) interest
on the overdue interest and principal at the rate borne by such Bonds, and in case such money shall be
insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so owing and unpaid upon the Bonds, then to the payment of such
interest, principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest on overdue interest and principal without
preference or priority among such interest, principal and interest on overdue interest and principal ratably to
the aggregate of such interest, principal and interest on overdue interest and principal.

Amendment of Documents

Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Authority and of the
Bondholders may be amended at any time by a Supplemental Trust Agreement which shall become binding
when the written consents of the Bondholders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then
Outstanding, exclusive of Bonds disqualified as provided in the Trust Agreement, are filed with the Trustee;
provided that if such modification or amendment will, by its terms, not take effect so long as any Bonds of any
particular maturity or Series remain Outstanding, the consent of the Holders of such Bonds shall not be
required and such Bonds shall not be deemed to be Outstanding for the purpose of any calculation of Bonds
Outstanding under the Trust Agreement. No such amendment shall (1) extend the maturity of or reduce the
interest rate on or amount of interest on or principal of or redemption premium, if any, on any Bond without
the express written consent of the Bondholder of such Bond, or (2) permit the creation by the Authority of any
pledge of or charge or lien upon the Revenues as provided in the Trust Agreement superior to or on a parity
with the pledge, charge and lien created thereby for the benefit of the Bonds, or (3) reduce the percentage of
Bonds required for the written consent to any such amendment, without the consent of all Bondholders, or
(4) modify any rights or obligations of the Trustee, the Authority, or the City without their prior written assent
thereto, respectively.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Bondholders to approve the particular
form of any Supplemental Trust Agreement, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the
substance thereof. Promptly after the execution by the Authority and the Trustee of any Supplemental Trust
Agreement pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall mail a notice on behalf of the Authority, setting
forth in general terms the substance of such Supplemental Trust Agreement to the Bondholders at the
addresses shown on the registration books maintained by the Trustee. Any failure to give such notice, or any
defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such Supplemental Trust
Agreement.

The Trust Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Authority and of the Bondholders may also
be amended at any time by a Supplemental Trust Agreement which shall become binding upon adoption
without the consent of any Bondholders for any purpose that will not materially adversely affect the interests
of the Bondholders, including (without limitation) for any one or more of the following purposes: (i) to add to
the agreements and covenants required in the Trust Agreement to be performed by the Authority other
agreements and covenants thereafter to be performed by the Authority, or to surrender any right or power
reserved in the Trust Agreement to or conferred therein on the Authority; (ii) to make such provisions for the
purpose of curing any ambiguity or of correcting, curing or supplementing any defective provision contained
in the Trust Agreement or in regard to questions arising under the Trust Agreement which the Authority may
deem desirable or necessary; (iii) to provide for the issuance of any Additional Bonds and to provide the terms

A-23

of such Additional Bonds, subject to the conditions and upon compliance with the procedure set forth in the
Trust Agreement (which shall be deemed not to adversely affect Bondholders); or (iv) to add to the agreements
and covenants required in the Trust Agreement, such agreements and covenants as may be necessary to qualify
the Trust Agreement under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.

Facilities Sublease or Facilities Lease. The Authority shall not supplement, amend, modify or
terminate any of the terms of the Facilities Sublease or Facilities Lease, or consent to any such supplement,
amendment, modification or termination, without the prior written consent of the Trustee. The Trustee shall
give such written consent if such supplement, amendment, modification or termination (a) will not materially
adversely affect the interests of the Bondholders or result in any material impairment of the security given by
the Trust Agreement for the payment of the Bonds (provided that such supplement, amendment or
modification shall not be deemed to have such adverse effect or to cause such material impairment solely by
reason of increasing the amount of Base Rental Payments to provide for the payment of Additional Bonds as
required by the Trust Agreement or substitution, release or addition of real property pursuant to the Facilities
Sublease), (b) is to add to the agreements, conditions, covenants and terms required to be observed or
performed thereunder by any party thereto, or to surrender any right or power therein reserved to the Authority
or the City, (c) is to cure, correct or supplement any ambiguous or defective provision contained therein, (d) is
to accommodate any increase in the amount of Base Rental Payments to provide for the payment of Base
Rental Payments as required by the Trust Agreement; or any addition, substitution or release of property in
accordance with the Facilities Sublease, (e) is to modify the legal description of the Facilities to conform to the
requirements of title insurance or otherwise to add or delete property descriptions to reflect accurately the
description of the parcels intended or preferred to be included therein, or substituted for the Facilities pursuant
to the provisions of the Facilities Sublease, or (f) if the Trustee first obtains the written consent of the
Bondholders of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding to such supplement, amendment,
modification or termination.

Discharge of Trust Agreement

If the Authority shall pay or cause to be paid or there shall otherwise be paid to the Bondholders of all
Outstanding Bonds the interest thereon and principal thereof and redemption premiums, if any, thereon at the
times and in the manner stipulated in the Trust Agreement and therein, and the Authority shall pay in full all
other amounts due under the Trust Agreement and under the Facilities Sublease, then the Bondholders of such
Bonds shall cease to be entitled to the pledge of and charge and lien upon the Revenues as provided in the
Trust Agreement, and all agreements, covenants and other obligations of the Authority to the Bondholders of
such Bonds under the Trust Agreement shall thereupon cease, terminate and become void and be discharged
and satisfied. In such event, the Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Authority all such instruments as may
be necessary or desirable to evidence such discharge and satisfaction, the Trustee shall pay over or deliver to
the Authority all money or securities held by it pursuant to the Trust Agreement which are not required for the
payment of the interest on and principal of and redemption premiums, if any, on such Bonds and for the
payment of all other amounts due under
the Facilities Sublease.
Notwithstanding anything in the Trust Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the principal and/or interest
of the Bonds shall be paid by the Bond Insurer pursuant to the Bond Insurance Policy, the Bonds shall remain
Outstanding for all purposes, not be defeased or otherwise satisfied and not be considered paid by the City, and
the assignment and pledge of the Trust Estate and all covenants, agreements and other obligations of the City
to the registered owners shall continue to exist and shall run to the benefit of the Bond Insurer, and the Bond
Insurer shall be subrogated to the rights of such registered owners.

the Trust Agreement and under

Any Outstanding Bonds shall prior to the maturity date or redemption date thereof be deemed to have
been paid within the meaning of and with the effect expressed in the paragraph above if (1) in case any of such
Bonds are to be redeemed on any date prior to their maturity date, the Authority shall have given to the Trustee
in form satisfactory to it irrevocable instructions to provide notice in accordance with the Trust Agreement,
(2) there shall have been deposited with the Trustee (A) money in an amount which shall be sufficient and/or
(B) Government Securities, the interest on and principal of which when paid will provide money which,
together with the money, if any, deposited with the Trustee at the same time, shall be sufficient, in the opinion

A-24

of an Independent Certified Public Accountant, to pay when due the interest to become due on such Bonds on
and prior to the maturity date or redemption date thereof, as the case may be, and the principal of and
redemption premiums, if any, on such Bonds, and (3) in the event such Bonds are not by their terms subject to
redemption within the next succeeding 60 days, the Authority shall have given the Trustee in form satisfactory
to it irrevocable instructions to mail as soon as practicable, a notice to the Bondholders of such Bonds that the
deposit required by clause (2) above has been made with the Trustee and that such Bonds are deemed to have
been paid in accordance with the Trust Agreement and stating the maturity date or redemption date upon which
money is to be available for the payment of the principal of and redemption premiums, if any, on such Bonds.

Only (1) cash, (2) non-callable direct obligations of the United States of America (“Treasuries”),
(3) evidences of ownership of proportionate interests in future interest and principal payments on Treasuries
held by a bank or trust company as custodian, under which the owner of the investment is the real party in
interest and has the right to proceed directly and individually against the obligor and the underlying Treasuries
are not available to any person claiming through the custodian or to whom the custodian may be obligated,
(4) subject to the prior written consent of AGM, pre-refunded municipal obligations rated “AAA” and “Aaa”
by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, or (5) subject to the prior written consent of AGM, securities eligible for
“AAA” defeasance under then existing criteria of S&P or any combination thereof, shall be used to effect
defeasance of the Bonds unless AGM otherwise approves.

To accomplish defeasance, the Authority shall cause to be delivered (i) a report of an independent firm
of nationally recognized certified public accountants or such other accountant as shall be acceptable to AGM
(“Accountant”) verifying the sufficiency of the escrow established to pay the Series 2015 Bonds in full on the
maturity or redemption date (“Verification”), (ii) an Escrow Deposit Agreement (which shall be acceptable in
form and substance to AGM), (iii) an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel to the effect that the
Series 2015 Bonds are no longer “Outstanding” under the Trust Agreement and (iv) a certificate of discharge
of the Trustee with respect to the Series 2015 Bonds; each Verification and defeasance opinion shall be
acceptable in form and substance, and addressed, to the Authority, Trustee and Insurer. AGM shall be provided
with final drafts of the above referenced documentation not less than five business days prior to the funding of
the escrow.

Series 2015 Bonds shall be deemed “Outstanding” under the Trust Agreement unless and until they

are in fact paid and retired or the above criteria are met.

Unclaimed Moneys

Any money held by the Trustee in trust for the payment and discharge of any of the Bonds or interest
thereon which remains unclaimed for two (2) years after the date when such Bonds or interest thereon have
become due and payable, either at their stated maturity dates or by call for redemption prior to maturity, if such
money was held by the Trustee at such date, or for two (2) years after the date of deposit of such money if
deposited with the Trustee after the date when such Bonds have become due and payable, shall at the Written
Request of the Authority be repaid by the Trustee to the Authority as its absolute property free from trust, and
the Trustee shall thereupon be released and discharged with respect thereto and the Bondholders shall not look
to the Trustee for the payment of such Bonds; provided, however, that before being required to make any such
payment to the Authority, the Trustee may, and at the request of the Authority shall, at the expense of the
Authority in either case, cause to be published once a week for two (2) successive weeks in a Financial
Newspaper of general circulation in Los Angeles and in San Francisco, California, and in the same or a similar
Financial Newspaper of general circulation in New York, New York, a notice that such money remains
unclaimed and that, after a date named in such notice, which date shall not be less than thirty (30) days after
the date of the first publication of each such notice, the balance of such money then unclaimed will be returned
to the Authority.

A-25

General Provisions Relating to Bond Insurance. So long as any Series 2015 Bonds remain outstanding and
AGM shall not have defaulted under the 2015 Bond Insurance Policy (or any amounts are owed to AGM), the
provisions summarized below shall govern, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Trust
Agreement, or individually in the appropriate sections:

(a)

AGM shall be deemed to be the sole holder of the Series 2015 Bonds for the purpose of
exercising any voting right or privilege or giving any consent or direction or taking any other action that the
holders of the Series 2015 Bonds are entitled to take pursuant to the Trust Agreement pertaining to (i) defaults
and remedies and (ii) the duties and obligations of the Trustee.
In furtherance thereof and as a term of the
Trust Agreement and each Series 2015 Bond, the Trustee and each Bondholder appoint AGM as their agent
and attorney-in-fact and agree that AGM may at any time during the continuation of any proceeding by or
against the Authority or City under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership, rehabilitation or similar law (an “Insolvency Proceeding”) direct all matters relating
to such Insolvency Proceeding,
limitation, (A) all matters relating to any claim or
enforcement proceeding in connection with an Insolvency Proceeding (a “Claim”), (B) the direction of any
appeal of any order relating to any Claim, (C) the posting of any surety, supersedeas or performance bond
pending any such appeal, and (D) the right to vote to accept or reject any plan of adjustment. In addition, the
Trustee and each Bondholder delegate and assign to AGM, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the rights of
the Trustee and each Bondholder in the conduct of any Insolvency Proceeding, including, without limitation,
all rights of any party to an adversary proceeding or action with respect to any court order issued in connection
with any such Insolvency Proceeding. Remedies granted to the Bondholders shall expressly include
mandamus.

including without

(b)

No grace period for a covenant default shall exceed 30 days or be extended for more than 60

days, without the prior written consent of AGM. No grace period shall be permitted for payment defaults.

(c)

Upon the occurrence of an extraordinary optional, special or extraordinary mandatory
redemption in part, the selection of Bonds to be redeemed shall be subject to the approval of AGM. The
exercise of any provision of the Trust Agreement which permits the purchase of Bonds in lieu of redemption
shall require the prior written approval of AGM if any Bond so purchased is not cancelled upon purchase.

(d)

Any amendment, supplement, modification to, or waiver of, the Trust Agreement or any other
transaction document, including any underlying security agreement (each a “Related Document”), that requires
the consent of Bondholders or adversely affects the rights and interests of AGM shall be subject to the prior
written consent of AGM.

(e)

Unless AGM otherwise directs, upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default or
an event which with notice or lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default, amounts on deposit in the
Acquisition and Construction Fund shall not be disbursed, but shall instead be applied to the payment of debt
service or redemption price of the Bonds.

(f)

The rights granted to AGM under the Trust Agreement or any other Related Document to
request, consent to or direct any action are rights granted to AGM in consideration of its issuance of the 2015
Bond Insurance Policy. Any exercise by AGM of such rights is merely an exercise of AGM’s contractual
rights and shall not be construed or deemed to be taken for the benefit, or on behalf, of the Bondholders and
such action does not evidence any position of AGM, affirmative or negative, as to whether the consent of the
Bondholders or any other person is required in addition to the consent of AGM.

(g)

Amounts paid by AGM under the 2015 Bond Insurance Policy shall not be deemed paid for
purposes of the Trust Agreement and the Series 2015 Bonds relating to such payments shall remain
Outstanding and continue to be due and owing until paid by the Authority in accordance with the Trust
Agreement. The Trust Agreement shall not be discharged unless all amounts due or to become due to AGM
have been paid in full or duly provided for.

A-26

(h)

Each of the Authority and Trustee covenant and agree to take such action (including, as
applicable, filing of UCC financing statements and continuations thereof) as is necessary from time to time to
preserve the priority of the pledge of the Trust Estate under applicable law.

(i)

AGM shall, to the extent it makes any payment of principal of or interest on the Series 2015
Bonds, become subrogated to the rights of the recipients of such payments in accordance with the terms of the
2015 Bond Insurance Policy (which subrogation rights shall also include the rights of any such recipients in
connection with any Insolvency Proceeding). Each obligation of the Authority to AGM under the Related
Documents shall survive discharge or termination of such Related Documents.

(j)

The Authority shall pay or reimburse (or cause the City to pay or reimburse) AGM any and all
charges, fees, costs and expenses that AGM may reasonably pay or incur in connection with (i) the
administration, enforcement, defense or preservation of any rights or security in any Related Document; (ii) the
pursuit of any remedies under the Trust Agreement or any other Related Document or otherwise afforded by
law or equity, (iii) any amendment, waiver or other action with respect to, or related to, the Trust Agreement or
any other Related Document whether or not executed or completed, or (iv) any litigation or other dispute in
connection with the Trust Agreement or any other Related Document or the transactions contemplated thereby,
other than costs resulting from the failure of AGM to honor its obligations under the 2015 Bond Insurance
Policy. AGM reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee as a condition to executing any amendment, waiver
or consent proposed in respect of the Trust Agreement or any other Related Document.

(k)

After payment of reasonable expenses of the Trustee, the application of funds realized upon
default shall be applied to the payment of expenses of the Authority or rebate only after the payment of past
due and current debt service on the Bonds and amounts required to restore the Reserve Fund to the Reserve
Fund Requirement.

(l)

AGM shall be entitled to pay principal or interest on the Series 2015 Bonds that shall become
Due for Payment but shall be unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Issuer (as such terms are defined in the
2015 Bond Insurance Policy), whether or not AGM has received a Notice of Nonpayment (as such terms are
defined in the 2015 Bond Insurance Policy) or a claim upon the 2015 Bond Insurance Policy.

(m)

In determining whether any amendment, consent, waiver or other action to be taken, or any
failure to take action, under the Trust Agreement would adversely affect the security for the Bonds or the rights
of the Bondholders, the Trustee shall consider the effect of any such amendment, consent, waiver, action or
inaction as if there were no 2015 Bond Insurance Policy.

(n)

No contract shall be entered into or any action taken by which the rights of AGM or security
for or sources of payment of the Series 2015 Bonds may be impaired or prejudiced in any material respect
except upon obtaining the prior written consent of AGM.

Claims Upon the 2015 Bond Insurance Policy and Payments by and to AGM

(a)

If, on the third Business Day prior to the related scheduled Interest Payment Date or Principal
Payment Date (each, a “Payment Date”) there is not on deposit with the Trustee, after making all transfers and
deposits required under the Trust Agreement, moneys sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the
Series 2015 Bonds due on such Payment Date, the Trustee shall give notice to AGM and to its designated
agent (if any) (the “Insurer’s Fiscal Agent”) by telephone or telecopy of the amount of such deficiency by
12:00 noon, New York City time, on such Business Day. If, on the second Business Day prior to the related
Payment Date, there continues to be a deficiency in the amount available to pay the principal of and interest on
the Series 2015 Bonds due on such Payment Date, the Trustee shall make a claim under the 2015 Bond
Insurance Policy and give notice to AGM and the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent (if any) by telephone of the amount of
such deficiency, and the allocation of such deficiency between the amount required to pay interest on the
Series 2015 Bonds and the amount required to pay principal of the Series 2015 Bonds, confirmed in writing to

A-27

AGM and the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on such second Business Day by
filling in the form of Notice of Claim and Certificate delivered with the 2015 Bond Insurance Policy.

(b)

The Trustee shall designate any portion of payment of principal on Series 2015 Bonds paid by
AGM, whether by virtue of mandatory sinking fund redemption, maturity or other advancement of maturity,
on its books as a reduction in the principal amount of Series 2015 Bonds registered to the then current
Bondholder, whether DTC or its nominee or otherwise, and shall issue a replacement Bond to AGM, registered
in the name of Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp., in a principal amount equal to the amount of principal so
paid (without regard to authorized denominations); provided that the Trustee’s failure to so designate any
payment or issue any replacement Bond shall have no effect on the amount of principal or interest payable by
the Authority on any Series 2015 Bond or the subrogation rights of AGM.

(c)

The Trustee shall keep a complete and accurate record of all funds deposited by AGM into
the Policy Payments Account (defined below) and the allocation of such funds to payment of interest on and
principal of any Series 2015 Bond. AGM shall have the right to inspect such records at reasonable times upon
reasonable notice to the Trustee.

(d)

Upon payment of a claim under the 2015 Bond Insurance Policy, the Trustee shall establish a
separate special purpose trust account for the benefit of Bondholders referred to in the Trust Agreement as the
“Policy Payments Account” and over which the Trustee shall have exclusive control and sole right of
withdrawal. The Trustee shall receive any amount paid under the 2015 Bond Insurance Policy in trust on
behalf of Bondholders and shall deposit any such amount in the Policy Payments Account and distribute such
amount only for purposes of making the payments for which a claim was made. Such amounts shall be
disbursed by the Trustee to Bondholders in the same manner as principal and interest payments are to be made
with respect to the Series 2015 Bonds under the sections of the Trust Agreement regarding payment of Series
2015 Bonds. It shall not be necessary for such payments to be made by checks or wire transfers separate from
the check or wire transfer used to pay debt service with other funds available to make such payments.
Notwithstanding anything in the Trust Agreement to the contrary, the Authority agrees, and shall cause the
City to agree, to pay to AGM (i) a sum equal to the total of all amounts paid by AGM under the 2015 Bond
Insurance Policy (the “Insurer Advances”); and (ii) interest on such Insurer Advances from the date paid by
AGM until payment thereof in full, payable to AGM at the Late Payment Rate per annum (collectively, the
“Insurer Reimbursement Amounts”). “Late Payment Rate” means the lesser of (a) the greater of (i) the per
annum rate of interest, publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank at its principal office
in The City of New York, as its prime or base lending rate (any change in such rate of interest to be effective
on the date such change is announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank) plus 3%, and (ii) the then applicable highest
rate of interest on the Series 2015 Bonds and (b) the maximum rate permissible under applicable usury or
similar laws limiting interest rates. The Late Payment Rate shall be computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. The Authority and the City covenant and agree that Insurer
Reimbursement Amounts are secured by a lien on and pledge of the Base Rental Payments and other amounts,
and payable from such Base Rental Payments and other amounts, on a parity with debt service due on the
Bonds.

(e)

Funds held in the Policy Payments Account shall not be invested by the Trustee and may not
be applied to satisfy any costs, expenses or liabilities of the Trustee. Any funds remaining in the Policy
Payments Account following an Interest Payment Date shall promptly be remitted to AGM.

Provisions Relating to 2015 Reserve Policy. So long as any Series 2015 Bonds remain outstanding and
AGM shall not have defaulted under the 2015 Reserve Policy (or any amounts are owed to AGM), the
following provisions govern, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Trust Agreement or
individually in the appropriate sections:

(a)

The Authority shall repay any draws under the 2015 Reserve Policy and pay all related
reasonable expenses incurred by AGM and shall pay interest thereon from the date of payment by AGM at the
Late Payment Rate. “Late Payment Rate” means the lesser of (x) the greater of (I) the per annum rate of

A-28

interest, publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank at its principal office in the City of
New York, as its prime or base lending rate (“Prime Rate”) (any change in such Prime Rate to be effective on
the date such change is announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank) plus 3%, and (ii) the then applicable highest rate
of interest on the Series 2015 Bonds and (y) the maximum rate permissible under applicable usury or similar
laws limiting interest rates. The Late Payment Rate shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed over a year of 360 days. In the event JPMorgan Chase Bank ceases to announce its Prime Rate
publicly, Prime Rate shall be the publicly announced prime or base lending rate of such national bank as AGM
shall specify. If the interest provisions of this subparagraph (a) shall result in an effective rate of interest
which, for any period, exceeds the limit of the usury or any other laws applicable to the indebtedness created in
the Trust Agreement, then all sums in excess of those lawfully collectible as interest for the period in question
shall, without further agreement or notice between or by any party to the Trust Agreement, be applied as
additional interest for any later periods of time when amounts are outstanding under the Trust Agreement to
the extent that interest otherwise due under the Trust Agreement for such periods plus such additional interest
would not exceed the limit of the usury or such other laws, and any excess shall be applied upon principal
immediately upon receipt of such moneys by AGM, with the same force and effect as if the Authority had
specifically designated such extra sums to be so applied and AGM had agreed to accept such extra payment(s)
as additional interest for such later periods. In no event shall any agreed-to or actual exaction as consideration
for the indebtedness created in the Trust Agreement exceed the limits imposed or provided by the law
applicable to this transaction for the use or detention of money or for forbearance in seeking its collection.

Repayment of draws and payment of expenses and accrued interest thereon at the Late Payment Rate
(collectively, “Policy Costs”) shall commence in the first month following each draw, and each such monthly
payment shall be in an amount at least equal to 1/12 of the aggregate of Policy Costs related to such draw.

Amounts in respect of Policy Costs paid to AGM shall be credited first to interest due, then to the
expenses due and then to principal due. As and to the extent that payments are made to AGM on account of
principal due, the coverage under the 2015 Reserve Policy will be increased by a like amount, subject to the
terms of the 2015 Reserve Policy. The obligation to pay Policy Costs shall be secured by a valid lien on all
revenues and other collateral pledged as security for the Series 2015 Bonds (subject only to the priority of
payment provisions set forth under the Trust Agreement).

All cash and investments in the Reserve Fund not allocable to a particular Series or Bonds shall be
transferred to the Revenue Fund for payment of debt service on Series 2015 Bonds before any drawing may be
made on the 2015 Reserve Policy or any other credit facility credited to the Reserve Fund in lieu of cash
(“Credit Facility”). Payment of any Policy Costs shall be made prior to replenishment of any such cash
amounts. Draws on all Credit Facilities (including the 2015 Reserve Policy) on which there is available
coverage shall be made on a pro-rata basis (calculated by reference to the coverage then available thereunder)
after applying all available cash and investments in the Reserve Fund. Payment of Policy Costs and
reimbursement of amounts with respect to other Credit Facilities shall be made on a pro-rata basis prior to
replenishment of any cash drawn from the Reserve Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, “available coverage”
means the coverage then available for disbursement pursuant to the terms of the applicable alternative credit
instrument without regard to the legal or financial ability or willingness of the provider of such instrument to
honor a claim or draw thereon or the failure of such provider to honor any such claim or draw.

(b)

If the Authority shall fail to pay any Policy Costs in accordance with the requirements of
subparagraph (a) summarized above, AGM shall be entitled to exercise any and all legal and equitable
remedies available to it, including those provided under the Trust Agreement other than (i) acceleration of the
maturity of the Bonds or (ii) remedies which would adversely affect owners of the Bonds.

(c)

The Trust Agreement shall not be discharged until all Policy Costs owing to AGM shall have
been paid in full. The Authority’s obligation to pay such amounts shall expressly survive payment in full of the
Series 2015 Bonds.

A-29

(d)

The Authority and the City shall include any Policy Costs then due and owing AGM in the

calculation of any applicable additional bonds test as set forth in the Trust Agreement.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 

To the Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council 
City of Moreno Valley, California 

Report on Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type 
activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City of Moreno Valley, 
California, (the City) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014, and the related notes to the financial 
statements,  which  collectively  comprise  the  City’s  basic  financial  statements  as  listed  in  the  table  of 
contents. 

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  these  financial  statements  in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the  design,  implementation,  and  maintenance  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  preparation  and  fair 
presentation  of  financial  statements  that  are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or 
error. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and 
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the  financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the 
assessment  of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or 
error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  City’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the City’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinions. 



To the Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council  
City of Moreno Valley, California 

Opinions

In  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the 
respective financial position of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, 
and  the  aggregate  remaining  fund  information  of  the  City  of  Moreno  Valley,  California,  as  of  
June 30, 2014, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof 
and  the  respective  budgetary  comparison  for  the  General  Fund,  CSD  Zones  Special  Revenue  Fund, 
Development  Impact  Fees  Special  Revenue  Fund,  Housing  Authority  Special  Revenue  Fund  and 
Neighborhood  Stabilization  Grant  Special  Revenue  Fund  for  the  year  then  ended  in  accordance  with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Other Matters 

Required Supplementary Information 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s 
discussion  and  analysis  be  presented  to  supplement  the  basic  financial  statements.  Such  information, 
although  not  a  part  of  the  basic  financial  statements,  is  required  by  the  Governmental  Accounting 
Standards  Board,  who  considers  it  to  be  an  essential  part  of  financial  reporting  for  placing  the  basic 
financial  statements  in  an  appropriate  operational,  economic,  or  historical  context.  We  have  applied 
certain  limited  procedures  to  the  required  supplementary  information  in  accordance  with  auditing 
standards  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America,  which  consisted  of  inquiries  of 
management  about  the  methods  of  preparing  the  information  and  comparing  the  information  for 
consistency  with  management’s  responses  to  our  inquiries,  the  basic  financial  statements,  and  other 
knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion 
or  provide  any  assurance  on  the  information  because  the  limited  procedures  do  not  provide  us  with 
sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 

Other Information 

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively 
comprise  the  City’s  basic  financial  statements.  The  introductory  section,  combining  and  individual 
nonmajor fund financial statements and schedules, and statistical section are presented for purposes of 
additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. 

The combining and individual nonmajor fund financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of 
management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records 
used  to  prepare  the  basic  financial  statements.  Such  information  has  been  subjected  to  the  auditing 
procedures  applied  in  the  audit  of  the  basic  financial  statements  and  certain  additional  procedures, 
including  comparing  and  reconciling  such  information  directly  to  the  underlying  accounting  and  other 
records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, 
and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America. In our opinion, the combining and individual nonmajor fund financial statements and 
schedules  are  fairly  stated,  in  all  material  respects,  in  relation  to  the  basic  financial  statements  as  a 
whole. 

The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the 
audit  of  the  basic  financial  statements  and,  accordingly,  we  do  not  express  an  opinion  or  provide  any 
assurance on them.

4Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

 
As  management  of  the  City  of  Moreno  Valley  (the  City),  we  offer  this  narrative  overview  and  analysis  of 
financial  activities  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2014.  We  encourage  readers  to  consider  the  information 
presented  here  in  conjunction  with  additional  information  furnished  in  our  letter  of  transmittal,  which  can  be 
found in the Introductory Section of this Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. All amounts, unless otherwise 
indicated, are expressed in thousands of dollars. 
 
Financial Highlights  
 
•  The  assets  of  the  City  of  Moreno  Valley  exceeded  its  liabilities  at  June  30,  2014,  by  $1.06  billion  (net 
position).  Of this amount, $70.8 million (unrestricted) may be used to meet the City’s ongoing obligations to 
citizens and creditors.  

•  The  City’s  net  position  increased  by  $35.6  million  from the  previous  fiscal  year.    Current  year  operations 
resulted in an increase of $6.2 million, $26.4 million was due to the extraordinary gain from the dissolution of 
the former Redevelopment Agency, and a restatement of $3.0 million to the beginning balance all contributed 
to this increase. 

•  For  business-type  activities,  revenues  exceeded  expenses  by  $0.4  million.  Adding  other  miscellaneous 
charges and transfer of $1.5 million to the revenue, the current fiscal year showed a $1.9 million surplus in the 
business-type activities.  

•  The total debt of the City showed a net increase of $17.4 million (18.9%) during the current fiscal year. The 
increase in debt was primarily as a result of $20.0 million of new debt secured for current and future street 
improvement projects.   

•  The General Fund had an end of year fund balance of $40.6 million. This was an increase of $6.2 million and 

an increase of 18.0% over FY 2012-13. 

 
Overview of Financial Statements 
 
This  discussion  and  analysis  is  intended  to  serve  as  an  introduction  to  the  City’s  basic  financial  statements, 
comprised  of  three  components:  1)  government-wide  financial  statements,  2)  fund  financial  statements,  and  
3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains certain supplementary information. 
 
Government-wide  financial  statements.    The  government-wide  financial  statements  are  designed  to  provide 
readers with a broad overview of the City’s finances, in a manner similar to a private-sector business. 
 
The statement of net position presents information on all of the City’s assets and liabilities, with the difference 
between the two reported as net position. Over time, increases or decreases in the net position may serve as a 
useful indicator of whether the financial position of the City is improving or deteriorating. 
 

  
 
The statement of activities presents information showing how the City’s net position changed during the  most 
recent  fiscal  year.  All  changes  in  net  position  are  reported  as  soon  as  the  underlying  event  giving  rise  to  the 
change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this 

 

  

  

 

5statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and 
earned but unused vacation leave). 
 
The government-wide financial statements display functions of the City that are principally supported by taxes 
and intergovernmental revenues (governmental activities) from other functions that are intended to recover all or a 
significant  portion  of  their  costs  through  user  fees  and  charges  (business-type  activities).  The  governmental 
activities  of  the  City  include  general  government,  public  safety,  community  development,  community  and 
cultural, public works, and interest on long-term debt. The business-type activities of the City include the Electric 
Utility. 
 
The government-wide financial statements include the City and its component units. The City’s component units 
are the Moreno Valley Community Services District, Moreno Valley Public Financing Authority, and the Moreno 
Valley Public Facilities Financing Corporation. Although legally separate, for all practical purposes these entities 
function as departments of the City and therefore have been blended as part of the primary government.  
 
Fund  financial  statements.    A  fund  is  a  grouping  of  related  accounts  that  is  used  to  maintain  control  over 
resources  that  have  been  segregated  for  specific  activities  or  objectives.  The  City,  like  other  state  and  local 
governments,  uses  fund  accounting  to  ensure  and  demonstrate  compliance  with  finance-related  legal 
requirements.  All  of  the  funds  of  the  City  can  be  divided  into  three  categories:  governmental,  proprietary  and 
fiduciary. 
 
Governmental funds.  Governmental funds are used to account for the same functions reported as governmental 
activities  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements.  However,  unlike  the  government-wide  financial 
statements, government fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources 
as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. 
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is 
useful  to  compare  the  information  presented  for  governmental  funds  with  similar  information  presented  for 
governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand 
the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions. Both the governmental funds balance 
sheet and the governmental funds statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a 
reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities. 
 
Information regarding governmental funds is presented separately in the governmental funds balance sheet and in 
the governmental funds statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances for the General Fund, 
the Community Services District Zones, the Development Impact Fees, the Housing Authority Special Revenue 
Funds, and the Neighborhood Stabilization Grant Fund. All of these are considered to be major funds. Data from 
the other governmental funds are combined into a single, aggregated presentation. Individual fund data for each of 
these  non-major  governmental  funds  is  provided  in  the  supplementary  section  of  the  report  in  the  form  of 
combining statements. 
 
The City adopts an annual appropriated budget for all of its funds. Budgetary comparison statement have been 
provided to demonstrate compliance with the budget. 
 
Proprietary funds.  The City maintains two different types of proprietary funds--enterprise and internal service 
funds.  Enterprise  funds  are  used  to  report  the  same  functions  presented  as  business-type  activities  in  the 
government-wide financial statements. The City uses an enterprise fund to account for its Electric Utility. Internal 
service funds are an accounting device used to accumulate and allocate costs internally among the City’s various 
functions.  The  City  uses  internal  service  funds  to  account  for  self-insured  insurance  programs,  technology 
services,  facilities  maintenance,  equipment  maintenance,  and  equipment  replacement.  Because  these  services 

 

6predominantly  benefit  governmental  rather  than  business-type  functions,  they  have  been  included  within 
governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements.  
 
Proprietary funds provide the same type of information as the government-wide financial statements, only in more 
detail.  The  Electric  Utility,  the  City’s  only  enterprise  fund,  is  included  in  the  Basic  Financial  Statements.  All 
internal  service  funds  are  combined  into  a  single,  aggregated  presentation  in  the  proprietary  funds  financial 
statements. Individual fund data for the internal service funds is provided in the form of combining statements in 
the supplementary section of the report. 
 
Fiduciary funds.  Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the City. 
In these cases, the City has a fiduciary responsibility and is acting as trustee. The Statement of Fiduciary Fund 
Assets and Liabilities, included in the Basic Financial Statements, separately reports all of the City’s fiduciary 
activities. The City’s fiduciary activities are reported in separate statements of fiduciary net position, statements 
of changes in fiduciary net position (Successor Agency of the former RDA only), and combining statement of 
changes in assets and liabilities (Agency Fund only). Detailed information of the fiduciary funds is in the Agency 
Funds section of the report. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the government-wide financial statements because 
the  resources  of  those  funds  are  not  available  to  support  the  City’s  own  programs.  However,  the  City  is 
responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  assets  reported  in  these  funds  are  used  for  their  intended  purposes.  The 
accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds. 
 
Notes  to  the  financial  statements.    The  notes  provide  additional  information  that  is  essential  to  a  full 
understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and fund financial statements.

As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position. In the 
case of the City of Moreno Valley, net position as a whole increased by 3.5% from $1.02 billion at June 30, 2013, 
to $1.06 billion at June 30, 2014. By far the largest portion of the City’s net position (78.9%) is its net investment

7in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings, machinery, and equipment). The City uses these capital assets to provide 
services  to  citizens;  consequently,  these  assets  are  not  available  for  future  spending.  Although  the  City’s  net 
investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay 
this  debt  must  be  provided  from  other  sources,  since  the  capital  assets  themselves  cannot  be  used  to  liquidate 
these liabilities.  
 
The following table presents a summary of the changes in net position of the City’s governmental and business-
type activities, as of June 30, 2014. Comparative data from fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, is also presented.

Charges  for  services  decreased  $5.7  million,  11.3%,  under  FY  2012-13.  This  decrease  was  primarily  due  to  a 
reclassification of a revenue item that was included as charges for services in FY 2012-13 that is classified as a 
special tax in FY 2013-14 in the amount of $4.9 million.    

 

 

8Operating and capital contributions and grants decreased $32.5 million, 43.7% under FY 2012-13. This category 
fluctuates dramatically each year depending upon the number and value of dedications of developer constructed 
and City investment in infrastructure projects, such as streets, curbs, gutters, and street lights.  

Property tax revenue increased $1.2 million, 9.1% over FY 2012-13. The Property Tax collections in FY 2013-14 
primarily increased as a result of property values experiencing a slight increase in valuation.   

Sales  tax  revenue  increased  $1.8  million,  13.1%  over  FY  2012-13.  The  sales  tax  revenue  is  directly  tied  to 
consumer spending and this increase is primarily due to the increase in taxable sales experienced this year that has 
been positively impacted by the development of sales tax generators such as Robertson’s Ready Mix, an Amazon 
Fulfillment Center, a new Volkswagen auto dealership, and an O’Reilly Auto Parts Distribution Center.  

Governmental Activities 

The  government’s  net  position,  with  the  restatement  of  $3.0  million,  increased  by  $33.7  million  with  total 
revenues  of  $172.3  million  and  total  expenses  of  $141.6  million.  Program  revenues  were  $66.7  million  and 
general revenues were $105.6 million. The largest single category of revenue was an extraordinary gain due to the 
dissolution of the former redevelopment agency at $26.4 million. The second largest single revenue category was 
operating contributions and grants, at $25.6 million. This is program revenue and goes directly against expenses 
in  recovering  the  costs  of  providing  those  services.  The  third  largest  single  revenue  category  was  charges  for 
services at $24.9 million. Capital contributions and grants at $16.3 million was the fourth largest single revenue 
source, and sales tax was the fifth largest revenue source at $15.9 million. The below graph presents the revenues 
by source for governmental activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, not including the extraordinary gain.

and cultural was the third largest expense category at $20.6 million. General government was the fourth largest 
expense category at $12.1 million, followed by community development at $7.8 million, the fifth largest expense 
category, and interest on long-term debt at $4.0 million, the sixth largest expense category.  

9The table below presents the cost of each of the six major program categories, and identifies each program’s net 
cost (total cost less revenues generated by the activities). The net cost is the amount paid for by general revenue 
sources that are generated by all City taxpayers.

As  illustrated  in  the  above  table,  program  revenues  recovered  $66.7  million  of  the  cost  of  providing  these 
services.  The  City  paid  for  the  remaining  public  benefit  portion  of  these  governmental  activities  with  
$74.7  million  in  taxes  (some  of  which  were  restricted  for  certain  programs)  and  with  other  revenues.  This

The  City’s  business-type  activities  include  the  activities  of  the  Electric  Utility.  The  net  position  of  the  City’s 
business-type activities increased $1.9 million primarily due to the increase in electric consumption. The Electric 
Utility had total revenues of $21.7 million, and total expenses of $19.8 million. 
 
THE CITY’S FUNDS 
 
Total fund balances presented in the governmental funds balance sheet are $170.0 million, with the General Fund 
representing  $40.6  million,  or  23.9%  of  the  total.  The  City’s  General  Fund  fund  balance  has  unassigned  fund 
balance of $27.5 million. 
 
General Fund Financial Results 
 
The  General  Fund  fund  balance  increased  by  $6.2  million  over  FY  2012-13  with  actual  results  realizing  an 
increase of $3.1 million in revenues along with expenditure savings of $3.1 million. The final budget anticipated a 
balanced budget with minimal impact to fund balance as FY 2013-14 was the third and final year of the Three-
Year Deficit Elimination Plan adopted by Council in response to the economic downturn.     
 
General Fund tax revenues were $1.5 million more than anticipated and an increase in charges for services of  
$0.7 million along with a $0.8 million increase in licenses, permits and miscellaneous activity all contributed to 
the unanticipated revenue increase.  
 
The  graph  below  presents  a  comparison  of  each  General  Fund  revenue  source  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  
June 30, 2013 and 2014.

FY 2012/13

FY 2013/14

 

11General Fund actual expenditures were $3.1 million less than the final budget. The major contributor to this result 
was in large part due to Police and Fire Services coming in under budget by $2.4 million primarily as a result of 
contract service rates coming in below budgeted rates.  
 
The graph below presents  a comparison of each General Fund expenditure category for the fiscal years  ended 
June 30, 2013 and 2014.

Other Major Fund Financial Results 
 
The fund balance of the Community Service District Zones Special Revenue Fund increased by $1.0 million over 
FY 2012-13. This fund accounts for the administration, operations and maintenance of the City’s various service 
zones established by the Moreno Valley Community Services District. The increase in fund balance is primarily 
the result of $1.8 million in transfers from the General Fund to support Residential Street Lights Administration 
($896,000), Library Services ($617,835), and projects in Parks and Community Services ($307,500).  
 

 

 

 

 

12The  fund  balance  of  the  Development  Impact  Fees  Special  Revenue  Fund  decreased  by  $0.4  million  under  
FY 2012-13.  This fund accounts for the developer impact fees, which are one-time charges, used to offset the 
additional public-service costs of new development. The decrease in fund balance is primarily due to the remodel 
of Fire Station #48 that received development impact fee funding during the fiscal year.   
 
The fund balance of the Housing Authority Fund increased $8.0 million over FY 2012-13. This fund accounts for 
the  housing  assets  as  a  result  of  the  recently  dissolved  redevelopment  agency  of  the  City.  In  FY  2013-14  the 
Successor  Agency  of  the  former  redevelopment  agency  transferred  to  the  Housing  Authority  several  property 
notes, Hemlock Apartments and Rancho Dorado South that were approved for transfer by the Successor Agency 
Oversight Board and the Department of Finance. 
 
The fund balance of the Neighborhood Stabilization Grant Fund decreased $0.1 million under FY 2012-13. This 
fund accounts for the grant allocation received by the City from Housing and Urban Development to address the 
foreclosure crisis and implement a neighborhood stabilization program. The decrease in fund balance is primarily 
the result of program expenses that were incurred for qualifying programs in the fiscal year.  
 
 
CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION 
 
Capital Assets  
 
At  the  end  of  2014,  the  City’s  governmental  activities  had  $1.28  billion  ($895.0  million  net  of  depreciation) 
invested  in  a  broad  range  of  capital  assets,  including  land,  buildings  and  improvements,  machinery  and 
equipment,  vehicles,  park  facilities,  roads,  highways  and  bridges.  The  net  increase  of  $28.0  million  from  
FY 2012-13 is primarily attributed to the increase in infrastructure. 
 
At June 30, 2014, the City’s business-type activities had $42.2 million ($36.0 million net of depreciation) invested 
in capital assets, primarily utility infrastructure. The net increase of $0.5 million from FY 2012-13 is primarily 
attributed to the increase in infrastructure.

Long-Term Debt 
 
At  year-end,  the  City’s  governmental  activities  had  $77.3  million  in  bonds,  notes,  certificates  of  participation, 
leases, and compensated absences, versus $60.6 million last year, an increase of $16.7 million, or 27.6%. This 
increase  is  primarily  due  to  the  issuance  of  $20  million  of  new  debt  secured  for  current  and  future  street 
improvement projects. 
 
At June 30, 2014, the City’s business-type activities had $28.1 million in bonds and compensated absences versus 
$28.5 million last year, a decrease of $0.4 million. The decrease was the result of normal maturity on existing 
debt.  The  City  was  able  to  meet  its  current  debt  obligations  in  a  timely  manner.  The  City  has  an  active  Debt 
Management Committee and an approved Debt Management Policy. The table on the next page provides the total 
long-term debt by category.

ECONOMIC FACTORS AND OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE YEARS  
 
Although the focus of this Annual Report is on the economic condition of the City in the fiscal year that ended 
June 30, 2014, it is important for the City’s financial management to report on current issues affecting the City 
and their economic impact on FY 2013-14 and future years. 
 
Clearly  the  economic  downturn  has  impacted  Moreno  Valley,  as  well  as  the  Inland  Region  as  a  whole.  Both 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties are experiencing a delayed and slow economic recovery period. With a 
population of 199,258, Moreno Valley is still experiencing population growth, albeit at a slower rate because of 
the economic downturn impacting California. Moreno Valley remains the second largest city in Riverside County 
and is presently the fourth largest city in the Inland Region. Though population growth has slowed because of the 
economy,  population  growth  continues  in  Moreno  Valley  because  of  its  strategic  location  at  the  junction  of 
Interstate I-215 and State Route 60, along with offering a wide array of quality housing options, a family oriented 
lifestyle and a variety of quality of life amenities.  
 
For  several  years  Moreno  Valley  has  experienced  substantial  non-residential  growth  including  significant  new 
commercial  retail  and  industrial  development.  The  economy  has  slowed  commercial  development  in  Southern 
California,  but  Moreno  Valley  continues  to  secure  new  business  development  opportunities.  In  FY  2013-14 
several  new  retail  and  industrial  developments  opened  adding  to  the  sales  tax  base  which  will  provide  a 
foundation for sales tax revenue to continue to grow moderately in the near future. 
 
Current economic activity is in the commercial sector, with a specific focus on logistics/distribution centers and 
medical  support  businesses.  The  City  Council  approved  an  Economic  Development  Action  Plan  during  
FY 2010-11 that specifically focuses on these market sectors to rebuild the City’s tax revenue base and promote 
job creation. The impact of the action plan has had a positive influence on the unemployment rate in our City as 
we  have  begun  to  experience  a  decrease  in  the  unemployment  rate  since  last  year  with  projections  to  further 
decrease this rate over the next few fiscal years. Creating employment opportunities and job growth is important 
to  the  continued  development  of  the community  and  to  the development  of the  City’s  tax  revenue  base  in  the 
future. 
 
In a recent credit status review by Standard & Poors the City’s credit rating was upgraded to A positive with a 
stable  outlook.  A  key  factor  in  achieving  the  strong  rating  result  was  the  action  of  City  Council  and  the  City 
Manager to balance the City’s General Fund budget. Our council and management team strategized, planned and 

 

15delivered on a three-year deficit elimination plan that has brought revenues in line with expenditures. As revenues 
continue to steadily grow we look forward to strategizing and planning our continued economic recovery.  
 
CONTACTING THE CITY’S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
 
This  financial  report  is  designed  to  provide  our  citizens,  taxpayers,  customers,  investors  and  creditors  with  a 
general  overview  of  the  City’s  finances  and  to  show  the  City’s  accountability  for  the  money  it  receives.  For 
component units that publish separate financial statements, those statements can be obtained from the City Clerk. 
Questions  concerning  any  of  the  information  provided  in  this  report  or  requests  for  additional  financial 
information  should  be  addressed  to  the  Chief  Financial  Officer/City  Treasurer,  City  of  Moreno  Valley,  14177 
Frederick Street, P.O. Box 88005, Moreno Valley, California 92552-0805.

Reconciliation of the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures 

and Changes in Fund Balances of Governmental Funds

to the Statement of Activities

Year Ended June 30, 2014

Net change in fund balances - total governmental funds

$    

18,560,047

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of activities are
different because:

    Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However, in the statement
    of activities, the costs of those assets is allocated over their estimated useful lives
    as depreciation expense. This is the amount by which capital outlays exceeded
    depreciation in the current period.

Capital outlay (excludes internal service capital outlay)
Depreciation expense (excludes internal service depreciation)
Contributed capital assets

    The issuance of long-term debt provides current financial resources in the governmental 
    funds, but issuing debt increases the long-term liabilities in the statement of net position.
    Repayment of principal is an expenditure in the governmental funds, but the repayment
    reduces long-term liabilities in the statement of net position.

Principal repayments
New debt issued
Refunded debt issued
Plus premium/discount on debt issued
Prepaid bond insurance on debt issued
Amortization of bond premiums/discounts and prepaid insurance

    Accrued interest for long-term liabilities. This is the net change in accrued interest
    for the current period.

    Compensated absences expenses reported in the statement of activities do not
    require the use of current financial resources and, therefore, are not reported as 
    expenditures in governmental funds.

    Governmental funds report all contributions in relation to the annual required
    contribution (ARC) for OPEB as expenditures, however in the statement
    of activities only the ARC is an expense.

    Revenues reported as unavailable revenue in the governmental funds and recognized
    in the statement of activities. These are included in the intergovernmental revenues
    in the governmental fund activity.

    Internal service funds are used by management to charge the costs of certain
    activities, such as equipment management and self-insurance, to individual funds.
    The net revenues (expenses) of the internal service funds is reported with
    governmental activities.

    Extraordinary gains and losses relating to capital assets and long-term liabilities
    transferred to the Successor Agency are reported in the statement of activities do not
    require the use of current financial resources, and therefore, are not reported in 
    the governmental funds.

Year Ended June 30, 2014  

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

a.  Description of the Reporting Entity 

 
The City of Moreno Valley, California (the City), is located in the County of Riverside and 
was incorporated on December 3, 1984 under the general laws of the State of California. 
The City operates under an elected Council/City Manager form of government. The City's 
major  operations  include  police  and  fire  protection,  public  works,  parks,  recreation  and 
certain social services and general administration services. 
 
Reporting Entity 
 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that 
these  financial  statements  represent  the  City  of  Moreno  Valley  and  its  component 
units. A component unit is included in the primary government's financial statements 
if the governing body is substantively the same as that of the City or if the component 
unit  provides  services  or  other  benefits  almost  entirely  to  the  primary  government. 
The  component  units  discussed  below  are  included  in  the  City's  reporting  entity 
because  of  their  operational  significance  or  financial  relationships  with  the  City. 
These  component  units  are  controlled  by  common  governing  boards,  which  are 
substantively the same as the City's and are presented as blended component units 
for financial reporting purposes. The component units have the same fiscal year end 
as the City.  

•  The Moreno Valley Community Services District (the District) was established 
pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Mello-Roos Community Facilities 
Act of 1982. Its purpose is to finance the acquisition and construction of certain 
major public capital infrastructure and improvements within the boundaries of 
the Community Facilities Districts. Separate financial statements for the District 
are available from the City Clerk. 

 
•  Community  Facilities  District  No.  3  (Auto  Mall  Refinancing),  and  Community 
Facilities  District  No.  87-1  and  87-1,  IA#1  (Towngate)  were  established 
pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Mello-Roos Community Facilities 
Act  of  1982.    Their  purpose  is  to  finance  the  acquisition  and  construction  of 
certain  major  public  capital  infrastructure  and  improvements  within  the 
boundaries of the Community Facilities Districts and they are governed by City 
Council.  Separate  financial  statements  are  not  available  for  the  Community 
Facilities Districts. 

 
•  The Moreno Valley Public Facilities Financing Corporation (MVPFFC) and the 
Moreno Valley Public Financing Authority (MVPFA) are nonprofit public benefit 
corporations, formed for the purpose of providing public facility financing to the 
City.  The  Corporations'  Boards  of  Directors  are  each  composed  of  the  five 
elected  City  Council  members.  Both  Corporations  may  acquire,  construct, 
rehabilitate,  remodel,  improve,  install  and  finance  or  lease  various  facilities, 
land and equipment for the benefit of the City. Separate financial statements 
are not available for the Public Facilities Financing Corporation and the Public 
Financing Authority.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 
•  The Moreno Valley Housing Authority (the Housing Authority) was established 
pursuant to State law section 34240 of the California Health and Safety Code, 
which  allows  for  every  City  to  establish  a  housing  authority.  The  Housing 
Authority is designed to protect local housing funds and programs, provide new 
revenue  opportunities  for  affordable  housing  programs,  serve  the  public 
interest, promote public safety and welfare, and ensure decent, safe, sanitary 
and affordable housing accommodations to persons of low income. The City of 
Moreno Valley City Council serves as the Housing Authority’s Commissioners. 
Separate financial statements are not available for the Housing Authority.  

The  accounting  policies  of  the  City  of  Moreno  Valley  conform  with  generally  accepted 
accounting principles as applicable to governments. The following is a summary of the 
significant policies. 

b.  Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements 

 
The  government-wide  financial  statements  (i.e.,  the  statement  of  net  position  and  the 
statement  of  activities)  report  information  on  all  of  the  nonfiduciary  activities  of  the 
primary  government  and  its component  units.  For  the  most  part, the  effect of  interfund 
activity has been removed from these statements. The primary government is reported 
separately  from  certain  legally  separate  component  units  for  which  the  primary 
government is financially accountable. 
 
The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a 
given function or segment is offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that 
are  clearly  identifiable  with  a  specific  function  or  segment.  Certain  indirect  costs  are 
included in the program expense reported for individual functions and activities. Program 
revenues include: 1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use or directly 
benefit from goods, services or privileges provided by a given function or segment, and  
2)  grants  and  contributions  that  are  restricted  to  meeting  the  operational  or  capital 
requirements  of  a  particular  function  or  segment.  Taxes  and  other  items  not  properly 
included among program revenues are reported instead as general revenues. 
 
Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds and fiduciary funds, 
even  though  the  latter  are  excluded  from  the  government-wide  financial  statements. 
Major  individual  governmental  funds  are  reported  as  separate  columns  in  the  fund 
financial statements. 
 

c.  Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Financial Statements Presentation 

 
The  government-wide  financial  statements  are  reported  using  the  economic  resources 
measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when 
earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of 
related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they 
are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility 
requirements imposed by the provider have been met.  

The  proprietary  and  private-purpose  trust  funds  are  reported  using  the  economic 
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. The agency funds 
have  no  measurement  focus  but  utilize  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting  for  reporting 
assets and liabilities.

City of Moreno Valley 

Notes to Financial Statements 

Year Ended June 30, 2014 (Continued) 

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 
Governmental  fund  financial  statements  are  reported  using  the  current  financial 
resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues 
are  recognized  as  soon  as  they  are  both  measurable  and  available.  Revenues  are 
considered  to  be  available  when  they  are  collectible  within  the  current  period  or  soon 
enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the government 
considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the 
current  fiscal  period,  while  grant  and  sales  tax  revenues  have  an  availability  period  of  
120 days. 
 
Expenditures  generally  are  recorded  when  a  liability  is  incurred,  as  under  accrual 
accounting.  However,  debt  service  expenditures,  as  well  as  expenditures  related  to 
compensated absences and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is 
due. 
 
Property taxes, franchise taxes, licenses and interest associated with the current fiscal 
period are all considered to be susceptible to accrual and as such have been recognized 
as  revenue  in  the  current  fiscal  period.  Only  the  portion  of  special  assessments 
receivable due within the current fiscal period is considered to be susceptible to accrual 
as  revenue  of  the  current  period.  All  other  revenue  items  are  considered  to  be 
measurable and available only when cash is received by the government. 
 
The City reports the following major governmental funds: 
 

The  General  Fund  is  the  government's  primary  operating  fund.  It  accounts  for  all 
financial  resources  of  the  general  government,  except  those  required  to  be 
accounted for in another fund. 

The CSD Zones Special Revenue Fund accounts for restricted property taxes for the 
various Community Services District (CSD) programs.  There are nine Zones within 
the  Community  Services  District  providing  services.  Zone  A-Parks  and  Community 
Services  provides  citywide  park  maintenance  and  recreation  programming.   
Zone  B-Residential  Street  Lighting  provides  residential  subdivision  street  lighting.  
Zone  C-Arterial  Street  Lighting  provides  citywide  street  lighting  on  major  arterial 
streets.  Zone  D-Standard  Landscaping  provides 
for  residential 
developments 
the  City.  Zone  E-Extensive  Landscaping  provides 
landscaping  in  major  developments  within  the  City.    Zone  L-Library  Services 
provides library services to City residents.  Zone M-Medians provides maintenance 
of  median  landscaping  within  the  City.    Community  Facilities  District  (CFD)  #1 
provides  maintenance  of  new  parks,  trails  and  class  1  bikeways.  Zone  S  – 
Sunnymead  Boulevard  Maintenance  provides  maintenance  of  extensive  landscape 
services for certain improvements along Sunnymead Boulevard.

The  Development  Impact  Fees  Special  Revenue  Fund  accounts  for  the  restricted 
fees  collected  to  provide  funding  for  capital  improvements  related  to  the  impact  of 
development  on  various  City  services.    The  City  collects  fees  for  the  following:  
arterial streets, traffic signals, fire facilities, police facilities, parkland facilities, Quimby 
in-lieu of parks, recreation facilities, library facilities, city hall facilities, corporate yard 
facilities, 
improvements,  maintenance  equipment,  animal  shelter 
facilities, and administrative fees. The City has elected to report this fund as a major 
fund.

The Housing Authority accounts for the housing assets as a result of the dissolution 
of the former Community Redevelopment Agency of the City.   
 
The  Neighborhood  Stabilization  Grant  Fund  is  used  to  account  for  the  grant 
allocation  received  by  the  City  from  HUD  to  address  the  foreclosure  crisis  and 
implement  a  neighborhood  stabilization  program  (NSP)  aimed  at  assisting  low-to 
moderate-income households, while targeting the areas of the City most affected by 
the foreclosures. 

 
The City reports the following major business-type fund: 
 

The Electric Fund accounts for the operations of the City electric utility, with its basic 
purpose  to  purchase  and  distribute  electricity  to  customers  in  the  City’s  newly 
developed  areas  under  the  “Greenfield”  concept.  The  City  began  serving  its  first 
customers in February 2004. 
 

Additionally the government reports the following fund types: 
 

for 

financial 

transactions  related 

Internal  Service  Funds  account 
to  repair, 
replacement  and  maintenance  of  City-owned  equipment,  the  City's  self-insurance 
programs  and  the  City's  general  information  systems  and  telecommunications 
hardware  and  software.  These  services  are  provided  to  other  departments  or 
agencies of the City on a cost reimbursement basis. 
 
The Agency Funds are used to report resources held by the City in a purely custodial 
capacity,  which  includes  assets  held  on  behalf  of  customers  and  trustees  for  the 
Assessment Districts, TUMF and MSHCP Trust funds. 

The Private-Purpose Trust Fund accounts for the assets and liabilities of the former 
redevelopment  agency  and  its  allocated  revenue  to  pay  estimated  installment 
payments  of  enforceable  obligations  until  obligations  of  the  former  redevelopment 
agency are paid in full and assets have been liquidated. 

 
As  a  general  rule,  the  effect  of  interfund  activity  has  been  eliminated  from  the 
government-wide  financial  statements.  Exceptions  to  this  general  rule  are  charges 
between the government's proprietary funds function and various other functions of the 
government.  Elimination  of  these  charges  would  distort  the  direct  costs  and  program 
revenues reported for the various functions concerned. 
 
Amounts reported as program revenues include: 1) charges to customers or applicants 
for  goods,  services  or  privileges  provided,  2)  operating  grants  and  contributions,  and  
3)  capital  grants  and  contributions,  including  special  assessments.  Internally  dedicated 
resources are reported as general revenues rather than as program revenues. Likewise, 
general revenues include all taxes.  
 
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items. 
Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing 
and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund's principal ongoing operations. 
The  principal  operating  revenues  of  the  Internal  Service  Funds  are  charges  to  other 
departments or agencies for sales and services. Operating expenses for Internal Service 
Funds include the cost of sales and services, administrative expenses and depreciation

on capital assets. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as 
nonoperating revenues and expenses. 
 

d.  Assets, Liabilities, Deferred Inflows and Net Position or Equity 

 
Deposits, Investments, Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 

The City's cash and cash equivalents are considered to be cash on hand, demand 
deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less 
from the date of acquisition. 
 
Investments for the City, as well as for its component units, are reported at fair value 
except  for  investment  contracts  that  are  reported  at  cost  because  they  are  not 
transferable and they have terms that are not affected by changes in market interest 
rates.  The  City's  policy  is  generally  to  hold  investments  until  maturity  or  until  fair 
values  equal  or  exceed  cost.  The  State  Treasurer's  Investment  Pool  operates  in 
accordance  with  appropriate  state  laws  and  regulations.  The  reported  value  of  the 
pool is the same as the fair value of the pool shares. 

 
Receivables and Payables 
 

Activity  between  funds  that  are  representative  of  lending/borrowing  arrangements 
outstanding at the end of the fiscal year are referred to as either "due to/from other 
funds" (i.e., the current portion of interfund loans) or "advances to/from other funds" 
(i.e.,  the  non-current  portion  of  interfund  loans).  All  other  outstanding  balances 
between  funds  are  reported  as  "due  to/from  other  funds."  Any  residual  balances 
outstanding  between  the  governmental  activities  and  business-type  activities  are 
reported in the government-wide financial statements as "internal balances." All trade 
and property tax receivables are shown net of an allowance for uncollectibles. 
 
All  trade  and  property  tax  receivables  are  shown  net  of  an  allowance  for

Inventory and Prepaid Items 
 

Inventories  are  valued  at  cost  using  the  first-in/first-out  (FIFO)  method.  Inventory 
consists of expendable supplies held for consumption. 
 
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and 
are  recorded  as  prepaid  items  in  both  government-wide  and  fund  financial 
statements. The fund balances in the governmental fund types have been set aside 
as nonspendable for amounts equal to the prepaid items in the fund-level statements, 
since these amounts are not available for appropriation. 
 

Capital Assets

Capital  assets,  which  include  property,  plant,  equipment  and  infrastructure  assets 
(e.g., 
the  
government-wide  financial  statements.  Capital  assets  are  defined  by  the  City  as 
assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5,000 (amount not rounded) and 
an estimated useful life in excess of two years. Such assets are recorded at historical

are recorded at estimated fair market value at the date of donation. 
 
The  costs  of  normal  maintenance  and  repairs  that  do  not  add  to  the  value  of  the 
asset or materially extend assets lives are not capitalized. 
 
Major  outlays  for  capital  assets  and  improvements  are  capitalized  as  projects  are 
constructed.

Deferred Inflows of Resources 

 

5 - 50
3 - 15
3 - 10
25 - 50

 

In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position and governmental balance 
sheet will sometimes report a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This 
separate  financial  statement  element,  deferred  inflows  of  resources,  represents  an 
acquisition of net position or fund balance that applies to a future period(s) and so will 
not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time. The City has 
only one item, which arises only under a modified accrual basis of accounting that 
qualifies for reporting in this category. Accordingly, the item, unavailable revenue, is 
reported only in the governmental funds balance sheet. Unavailable revenue arises 
when potential revenue does not meet both the "measurable" and "available" criteria 
for recognition in the current period. The amount is deferred and recognized as an 
inflow of resources in the period when the amount becomes available. 
 

 
The City reports unearned revenue in the fund-level statements and in the statement 
of net position. Unearned revenue arises when the City receives resources before it 
has a legal claim to them, as when grant monies are received prior to the incurrence 
of qualifying expenditures. 
 

Unearned Revenue 

Compensated Absences 
 

It is the government's policy to permit employees to accumulate earned but unused 
annual  leave  benefits.  The  City  records  the  annual  leave  liability  using  benefits 
earned  by  employees  at  the  balance  sheet  date  that  will  result  in  termination 
payments  rather  than  compensated  absences.  The  City  records  the  annual  leave 
liability  using  the  dollar  value  of  employees'  rights  to  receive  compensation 
attributable to services already rendered. 
 
 
 

48In the government-wide financial statements, and proprietary and fiduciary fund types 
in the fund financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are 
reported as liabilities. Bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over 
the life of the bonds using the effective interest method. Bonds payable are reported 
net  of  the  applicable  bond  premium  or  discount.  Issuance  costs,  whether  or  not 
withheld  from  the  actual  debt  proceeds  received,  are  reported  as  debt  service 
expenditures. 
 
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize bond premiums 
and discounts during the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported 
as other financing sources. Premiums received on debt  issuances  are  reported  as 
other  financing  sources  while  discounts  on  debt issuances are reported as other 
financing  uses.  Issuance  costs,  whether  or  not  withheld  from  the  actual  debt 
proceeds received, are reported as debt service expenditures. 
 

Land  purchased  for  the  purposes  of  resale  is  recorded  at  cost  or,  if  lower,  the 
estimated net realizable value upon entering into an agreement to sell the property.

Note 1: 
 

Long-Term Obligations 
 

In  the  governmental  fund  financial  statements,  fund  balances  are  classified  as 
follows: 
 

Nonspendable  include  amounts  that  cannot  be  spent  because  they  are  either  
(a) not in spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained 
intact. 
 
Restricted  include  amounts  that  are  constrained  on  the  use  of  resources  by 
either (a) external creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other 
governments,  or  (b)  by  law  through  constitutional  provisions  or  enabling 
legislation.  
 
Committed include amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant 
to  constraints  imposed  by  formal  action  of  the  government’s  highest  authority, 
City Council.  The formal action that is required to be taken to establish, modify, 
or rescind a fund balance commitment is a resolution by the City Council. 
 
Assigned include amounts that are constrained by the government’s intent to be 
used  for  specific  purposes,  but  are  neither  restricted  nor  committed.  The 
Financial and Management Services Director is authorized to assign amounts to 
a specific purpose, which was established by the governing body in a resolution. 
 
Unassigned  include  the  residual  amounts  that  have  not  been  restricted, 
committed, or assigned to specific purposes. 
 

An individual governmental fund could include nonspendable resources and amounts 
that are restricted, committed, assigned, or unassigned or any combination of those 
classifications. Restricted amounts are to be considered spent when an expenditure 

49

is  incurred  for  purposes  for  which  both  restricted  and  unrestricted  fund  balance  is 
available  and  committed,  assigned,  then  unassigned  amounts  are  considered  to 
have been spent when an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which amounts in 
any of those unrestricted fund balance classifications can be used. 
 

Fund Balance Flow Assumptions 
 

Sometimes  the  government  will  fund  outlays  for  a  particular  purpose  from  both 
restricted  and  unrestricted  resources  (the  total  of  committed,  assigned,  and 
unassigned fund balance). In order to calculate the amounts to report as restricted, 
committed,  assigned,  and  unassigned  fund  balance  in  the  governmental  fund 
financial statements, a flow assumption must be made about the order in which the 
resources  are  considered  to  be  applied.  It  is  the  government’s  policy  to  consider 
restricted fund balance to have been depleted before using any of the components of 
unrestricted  fund  balance.  Further,  when  the  components  of  unrestricted  fund 
balance can be used for the same purpose, committed fund balance is depleted first, 
followed by assigned fund balance. Unassigned fund balance is applied last. 
 

Net Position Flow Assumption 
 

Sometimes  the  government  will  fund  outlays  for  a  particular  purpose  from  both 
restricted  (e.g.,  restricted  bond  or  grant  proceeds)  and  unrestricted  resources.  In 
order  to  calculate  the  amounts  to  report  as  restricted  –  net  position  and  
unrestricted  –  net  position  in  the  government-wide  and  proprietary  fund  financial 
statements, a flow assumption must be made about the order in which the resources 
are considered to be applied. It is the government’s policy to consider restricted – net 
position to have been depleted before unrestricted – net position is applied. 
 

Property Taxes 
 

Property taxes attach as an enforceable lien on property as of January 1. Secured 
property taxes are payable in two installments with December 10 the last day to pay 
the first installment of secured property taxes without penalty, and April 10 the last 
day  to  pay  the  second  installment  of  secured  property  taxes  without  penalty. 
Unsecured personal property taxes are due in a single installment on August 31. The 
County of Riverside bills and collects the property taxes and remits them to the City 
in installments during the year. Property taxes received within 60 days after the City's 
fiscal year end are considered "measurable" and "available" and are accrued in the 
City's financial statements.

a.  Budget Information 

 
Budgets  are  legally  adopted  and  formal  budgetary  integration  is  employed  as  a 
management control device during the year for all governmental fund types. The budget 
is  prepared  on  a  GAAP  (Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles)  basis.  From  the 
effective  date  of  the  budget,  the  amounts  stated  therein  as  proposed  expenditures 
become appropriations to the various City departments. 
 
The  City  Council  may  amend  the  budget  only  during  a  regular  meeting,  providing  that 
sufficient  monies  are  available  and  that  expenditures  of  proceeds  of  taxes  will  not  be 
increased beyond the constitutional appropriation limit as imposed by Article XIIIB of the 
State Constitution. 
 
The City's formal budgetary process begins at the operating program level. Departmental 
budgets are comprised of the various operating program budgets. Operating programs do 
not  cross  departmental  lines.    Individual  fund  budgets  consist  of  the  departmental 
budgets; departmental budgets may cross fund lines. 
 
Individual fund budgets are, in all cases where appropriations are required, the same as 
the  appropriation  amounts.  In  the  case  of  the  Governmental  Fund  types,  unexpended 
budgeted amounts, except for amounts relating to capital projects, lapse at the end of the 
budget year. Spending control (legal level) for most funds is established by the amount of 
expenditures  budgeted  at  the  departmental  and  fund  levels.  Accordingly,  the  General 
Fund expenditures are displayed in the supplementary schedules at the department level 
and  the  Special  Revenue,  Debt  Service  and  Capital  Projects  Funds  expenditures  are 
displayed at the function level. Management control is exercised at the line item level in 
each  operating  program.  Management  can  transfer  budgeted  amounts  between 
operating programs, departments or funds, provided that such transfers do not increase 
the overall budget. Appropriations that increase the budget require City Council approval. 
 
For fiscal year 2013-2014, the following funds had no adopted annual budgets: 
 

•  Traffic Signal Mitigation Capital Projects Fund 
•  Warner Ranch Capital Development Capital Projects Fund 

 
These funds had no adopted budget due to the timing of the usage of the funds. Money 
will be budgeted as needed based on specific projects to be completed with these funds.

City of Moreno Valley 

Notes to Financial Statements 

Year Ended June 30, 2014 (Continued) 

Cash and Investments (Continued) 
 
The City follows the practice of pooling cash and investments of all funds, except for funds 
required  to  be  held  by  fiscal  agents  under  provisions  of  bond  indentures.  Interest  income 
earned on pooled cash and investments is allocated monthly to the various funds based on 
monthly  cash  and  investment  balances.  Interest  income  from  cash  and  investments  with 
fiscal agents is credited directly to the related fund.   

Deposits 

The  California  Government  Code  requires  California  banks  and  savings  and  loan 
associations to secure a City’s deposits by pledging government securities with a value of 
110% of a City’s deposits. California law also allows financial institutions to secure City 
deposits by pledging first trust deed mortgage notes having a value of 150% of a City’s 
total deposits. The City Treasurer may waive the collateral requirement for deposits that 
are fully insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC. The collateral for deposits in federal and 
state  chartered  banks  is  held  in  safekeeping  by  an  authorized  Agent  of  Depository 
recognized by the State of California Department of Banking. The collateral for deposits 
with savings and loan associations is generally held in safekeeping by the Federal Home 
Loan Bank in San Francisco, California as an Agent of Depository. These securities are 
physically  held  in  an  undivided  pool  for  all  California  public  agency  depositors.  Under 
Government Code Section 53655, the placement of securities by a bank or savings and 
loan  association  with  an  “Agent  of  Depository”  has  the  effect  of  perfecting  the  security 
interest in the name of the local government agency. Accordingly, all collateral held by 
the California Agents of Depository are considered to be held for, and in the name of, the 
local government agency.  
 

Investments 

Under  provisions  of  the  City’s  investment  policy,  and  in  accordance  with  the  California 
Government Code, the following investments are authorized: 
•  U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes and Bonds 
•  Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE’s) or U.S. Agencies  
•  California State Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) 
•  Bonds, notes or other indebtedness of the State of California 
•  Bonds, notes or other indebtedness of local agencies in California 
•  Bankers Acceptances  
•  Commercial Paper 
•  Commercial Paper issued under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) 
•  Time Deposits and Non-negotiable Certificates of Deposit 
•  Negotiable Certificates of Deposit 
•  Repurchase Agreements 
•  Corporate Obligations (Medium-term Notes) 
•  Corporate  Obligations  (Medium-term  Notes)  issued  under  the  Temporary  Liquidity 

Guarantee Program (TLGP) 

•  Mutual Funds and Money Market Accounts 
•  Other Government Sponsored Investment Pools 

 
Investments Authorized by Debt Agreements 

The above investments do not address the investment of debt proceeds held by a bond 
trustee. Investments of debt proceeds held by a bond trustee are governed by provisions

of the debt agreements, rather than the general provisions of the California Government 
Code or the City’s investment policy. 

Investments in State Investment Pool 

The  City  is  a  voluntary  participant  in  the  Local  Agency  Investment  Fund  (LAIF)  that  is 
regulated  by  California  Government  Code  Section  16429  under  the  oversight  of  the 
Treasurer  of the  State  of California.  LAIF  is  overseen  by  the Local  Agency  Investment 
Advisory Board, which consists of five members, in accordance with State statute. The 
State  Treasurer’s  Office  audits  the  fund  annually.  The  fair  value  of  the  position  in  the 
investment pool is the same as the value of the pool shares.  

 
GASB Statement No. 31 

The  City  adopted  GASB  Statement  No.  31,  Accounting  and  Financial  Reporting  for 
Certain  Investments  and  for  External  Investment  Pools,  as  of  July  1,  1997.  GASB 
Statement No. 31 establishes fair value standards for investments in participating interest 
earning  investment  contracts,  external  investment  pools,  equity  securities,  option 
contracts,  stock  warrants  and  stock  rights  that  have  readily  determinable  fair  values. 
Accordingly,  the  City  reports  its  investments  at  fair  value  in  the  balance  sheet.  All 
investment income, including changes in the fair value of investments, is recognized as 
revenue in the operating statement.  
 

Credit Risk 

The City’s investment policy limits investments in medium term notes (MTN’s) to those 
rated in the top category by two of the three largest nationally recognized rating services 
at the time of purchase (with split ratings, the lower rating must meet the standard). As of 
June 30, 2014, the City’s investment in medium term notes consisted of investments with 
Blackrock Inc., PepsiCo Inc., JP Morgan Chase, IBM Corp, Wells Fargo Bank, Berkshire 
Hathaway, Coca Cola Company, Bank of New York, Pfizer Inc., Praxair Inc., EBAY Inc., 
Google  Inc.,  John  Deere,  Occidental  Petroleum,  United  Technologies  Corp.,  Chevron 
Corp.,  Intel  Corp.,  WalMart  Stores  Inc.,  Apple  Inc.,  U.S.  Bankcorp,  General  Electric, 
Cisco Systems, Honda, Toyota, and Chase.  At June 30, 2014, all MTN’s were rated “A” 
or higher by Moody’s.  All securities were investment grade and legal under State and 
City law at their time of purchase.  Federal agency securities are rated AA+.  Investments 
in  U.S.  Treasury  securities  are  not  considered  to  have  credit  risk  and,  therefore,  their 
credit  quality  is  not  disclosed.  As  of  June  30,  2014,  the  City’s  investments  in  external 
investment pools and investment agreements are unrated.  
 

Custodial Credit Risk 

The  custodial  credit  risk  for  deposits  is  the  risk  that,  in  the  event  of  the  failure  of  a 
depository financial institution, a government will not be able to recover deposits or will 
not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. 
The carrying amount of the City’s demand deposits was ($1,315,312) at June 30, 2014. 
Bank balances before reconciling items was $2,372,882 at that date, the total amount of 
which  was  collateralized  or  insured  with  securities  held  by  the  pledging  financial 
institutions in the City’s name as discussed above under “Deposits”. The custodial credit 
risk  for  investments  is  the  risk  that,  in  the  event  of  the  failure  of  the  counterparty  to  a 
transaction, a government will not be able to recover the value of investment or collateral 
securities that are in the possession of an outside party.  In accordance with the City’s

investment policy, all investments are held by third-party custodians for safekeeping, with 
the securities in the City’s name.  This is the lowest level of custodial credit risk exposure. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The  City’s  investment  policy  limits  investment  maturities  as  a  means  of  managing  its 
exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. The City’s investment 
portfolio will not directly invest in securities maturing in more than five years. The City has 
elected to use the segmented time distribution method of disclosure for its interest rate 
risk. 

As of June 30, 2014, the City had the following investments and original maturities:

In prior years, the City made various loans to the former Redevelopment Agency.  Upon 
dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency, certain loans were approved as enforceable 
obligations in a letter dated May 26, 2012, from the California Department of Finance and 
remain as a receivable in the General Fund and a liability of the Successor Agency.  At  
June 30, 2014, the balance of $16,998,503 consists of the following: 
 
The Towngate Regional Mall notes (Sears Note) totaling $13,000,000, originate from a 
participation  agreement  (as  amended)  whereby  the  Agency  acquired  certain  parcels 
within the mall for subsequent transfer to major tenants. The notes bear interest at 7.25% 
and  are  payable  solely  from  available  site-generated  property  tax  increment  and  up  to 
50%  of  site-generated  sales  tax.  Furthermore,  the  Agency  has  covenanted  to  use 
reasonable  best  efforts  to  refinance  these  notes  with  Tax  Allocation  Bonds,  provided 
such financing is determined to be fiscally feasible. At June 30, 2014, accrued interest 
amounts to $3,331,838. 
 
The long-term payable to the General Fund from the Agency Debt Service Fund includes 
$652,248  representing  monies  borrowed  in  prior  fiscal  years  by  the  Agency  to  finance 
redevelopment activities. The monies loaned to the Agency bear an interest rate of 12%. 
Repayment  of  the  long-term  payable  will  be  made  when  funds  becomes  available.  At 
June 30, 2014, accrued interest amounts to $14,417.

Towngate  CFD  87-1  2007  Special  Tax  Refunding  Bonds  in  the  original  issue  of 
$10,665,000 were issued in November 2007, to refund prior bonds currently outstanding, 
to fund a reserve for the bonds and to pay issuance costs.  The bonds mature in serial 
fashion through December 1, 2021 and bear interest ranging from 3.50% to 5.00%. The 
bonds are subject to both optional and mandatory redemption prior to maturity beginning 
on December 1, 2017. The bonds are payable from and secured by a special tax levy 
against  certain  affected  parcels  within 
the  District.  Under  an  arrangement  
(Participation Agreement) involving the District, the City and the Successor Agency of the 
former  RDA,  the  required  tax  levy  may  be  reduced  in  part  by  the  reimbursable  tax 
increment and utility reimbursements from the Agency.

Employee Pension Plan 

 
Note 8:  
 

Plan Description 
 

The City's defined benefit pension plan, Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), 
provides  retirement  and  disability  benefits,  annual  cost-of-living  adjustments  and  death 
benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS is part of the Public Agency portion of 
the  California  Public  Employees  Retirement  System 
(CalPERS),  an  agent  
multiple-employer plan administered by CalPERS, which acts as a common investment 
and administrative agent for participating public employers within the State of California. 
A  menu  of  benefit  provisions,  as  well  as  other  requirements,  is  established  by  state 
statutes within the Public Employees' Retirement Law. The City selects optional benefit 
provisions  from  the  benefit  menu  by contract with  CalPERS  and adopts  those  benefits 
through  local  ordinance.  CalPERS  issues  a  separate  comprehensive  annual  financial 
report.  Copies  of  the  CalPERS  annual  financial  report  may  be  obtained  from  the 
CalPERS Headquarters, 400 Q Street, Sacramento, California 95811. 

Active  plan  members  in  PERS  are  required  to  contribute  a  percentage  of  their  annual 
covered salary based on their hire date.  The City pays the 8% required contribution for 
employees  hired  prior  to  July  1,  2009.    Employees  hired  between  July  1,  2009  and 
December  22,  2011,  have  a  required  employee  contribution  of  8%.  Employees  hired 
between December 23, 2011 and December 31, 2012 have a required contribution of 7% 
and  the  required  contribution  for  all  employees  hired  on  or  after  January  1,  2013  is 
6.25%.  The City is required to contribute the actuarially determined remaining amounts 
necessary to fund the benefits for its members. The actuarial methods and assumptions 
used are those adopted by the CalPERS Board of Administration. The required employer 
contribution rate was 22.305% for fiscal year 2013-2014. The contribution requirements

of the plan members are established by state statute and the employer contribution rate 
is established and may be amended by CalPERS. 

 
Annual Pension Cost 
 

For fiscal year 2013-2014, the City's annual pension cost was $4,267,872. The City also 
contributed  $1,608,343  on  behalf  of  the  employees  for  the  employee  contribution.  The 
required  contribution  for  the  fiscal  year  2013-2014  was  determined  as  part  of  the  
June 30, 2011, actuarial valuation using the entry age normal actuarial cost method with 
the  contributions  determined  as  a  percent  of  pay.  The  actuarial  assumptions  included:  
a) 7.75% investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses), b) projected salary 
increases for employees that vary by duration of service ranging from 3.30% to 14.20% 
for  miscellaneous  members,  and  c)  3.25%  cost-of-living  adjustment.  Both  a)  and  
b) include an inflation component of 2.75%. The actuarial value of assets was determined 
using  a  technique  that  smooth’s  the  effect  of  short-term  volatility  in  the  fair  value  of 
investments  over  a  15-year  period.  The  PERS  unfunded  actuarial  accrued  liability  (or 
excess assets) is being amortized as a level percentage of projected payroll on a closed 
basis. The remaining amortization period at June 30, 2014, was 21 years.

Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) 

Note 9: 
 

Plan Description 

 
The City's defined benefit postemployment healthcare plan provides a portion of certain 
health care for retired employees. In accordance with City policy, employees hired prior 
to September 30, 2011, who retire directly from the City under CalPERS (age 50 and 5 
years of CalPERS service or disability) and are not temporary employees, are eligible for 
these  benefits.  In  June  2009,  the  City  established  an  irrevocable  trust  fund  to  begin 
funding  the  City’s  unfunded  liability  through  the  California  Employers’  Retiree  Benefit 
Trust  (CERBT),  an  agent  multiple-employer  plan  administered  by  California  Public 
Employees’  Retirement  System  (CalPERS),  which  acts  as  a  common  investment  and

A  menu  of  benefit  provisions,  as  well  as  other  requirements,  are  established  by  state 
statutes within the Public Employees' Retirement Law. The City selects optional benefit 
provisions  from  the  benefit  menu  by  contract  with  CalPERS  and  adopts  those  benefits

Headquarters, 400 Q Street, Sacramento, California 95811. 
 

Funding Policy 
 

The contribution requirements of plan members and the City are established and may be 
amended  by  City  Council.  The  City  is  required  to  contribute  the  Annual  Required 
Contribution (ARC) of the employer, an amount actuarially determined in accordance with 
the  parameters  of  GASB  Statement  45.  The  ARC  represents  a  level  of  funding  that,  if 
paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover normal cost each year and amortize any 
unfunded actuarial liabilities over a period not to exceed thirty years. The current ARC 
rate is 5.00% of the annual covered payroll. 
 

Annual OPEB Cost 
 

For fiscal year 2013-2014, the City’s annual OPEB cost was $1,066,000. The required 
contribution  for  the  fiscal  year  was  determined  as  part  of  the  June  30,  2013  actuarial 
valuation using the entry age normal cost method. The actuarial assumptions included:  
a) 6.00% investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses), b) projected salary 
increases for employees of 3.25%, and c) an annual healthcare cost increase of 4.5%. 
Both a) and b) include an inflation component of 3.00%. The amortization method is the 
level percent of payroll. The amortization period is a 30 year fixed (closed) period for the 
initial unfunded accrued actuarial liability with 24 years remaining as of June 30, 2014.  
 
The following table shows the components of the City’s annual OPEB cost for the year, 
the  amount  actually  contributed  to  the  plan,  and  changes  in  the  City’s  net  OPEB 
obligation for these benefits:

Actuarial  valuations  of  an  ongoing  plan  involve  estimates  of  the  value  of  reported 
amounts  and  assumptions  about  the  probability  of  occurrence  of  events  far  into  the 
future.  Examples  include  assumptions  about  future  employment,  mortality,  and  the 
healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined regarding the funded status of the plan and 
the  annual  required  contributions  of  the  employer  are  subject  to  continual  revision  as 
actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made about 
the  future.  The  schedule  of  funding  progress,  presented  as  required  supplementary 
information  on  the  next  page,  presents  multi-year  trend  information  about  whether  the 
actuarial  value  of  plan  assets  is  increasing  or  decreasing  over  time  relative  to  the 
actuarial accrued liabilities for the benefits.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions 

 

 

 

 
Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan 
(the plan as understood by the employer and the plan members) and include the types of 
benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing the 
benefit costs between employer and plan members to that point. The actuarial methods 
and  assumptions  used  include  techniques  that  are  designed  to  reduce  the  efforts  of 
short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial assets, consistent with 
the long-term perspective of the calculations. 
 
The  City’s  annual  OPEB  cost,  the  percentage  of  annual  OPEB  cost  contributed  to  the 
plan, and the net OPEB obligation for last three fiscal years were as follows:

a.  Community Facilities District No. 3 Agreement  

 
In conjunction with the issue of the Moreno Valley Auto Mall Special Tax Bonds Series 
2000 (Auto Mall Refinancing), the Successor Agency of the former RDA and the City are 
parties to an owner-participation agreement which provides that the Agency will transmit 
to the Community Facilities District No. 3 (District) the available property tax increment it 
receives  on  parcels  within  the  District  as  a  credit  against  the  special  parcel  taxes  that 
otherwise  would  be  payable  by  the  owners.  This  agreement  replaces  a  previous 
arrangement  involving  these  parcels  when  they  were  included  in  Community  Facilities 
District No. 2. 

b.  Community Facilities District No. 87-1 Agreement 

 
In  connection  with  the  issuance  of  the  Community  Facilities  District  No.  87-1  (CFD) 
Towngate  2007  Special  Tax  Refunding  Bonds,  the  former  Community  Redevelopment 
Agency  entered  into  an  owner  participation  agreement  whereby  the  Agency  has 
committed tax increment for the payment of debt service requirements for these Bonds. 
 

c.  Other Agreements 

 
On  May  10,  2005,  the  former  Community  Redevelopment  Agency  and  the  Community 
Services  District  entered  into  a  lease  agreement  for  the  Conference  and  Recreation 
Center.    The  Community  Services  District  occupied  the  building  during  June  2005 
although construction was still in progress.  Upon completion of construction during fiscal 
year  2005-2006,  the  lease  agreement  became  effective  for  a  base  rent  of  $1.00  per 
month.  The Community Services District has responsibility for facility maintenance and 
provides programming that serves the residents of the Project Area.

e.  Litigation 

Note 12:  Self-Insurance 
 

 
There are several lawsuits pending against the City. The outcome and eventual liability of 
the City, if any, in these cases is not known at this time. Management estimates that the 
potential  claims  against  the  City,  not  covered  by  insurance  or  self-insurance  reserves, 
resulting  from  such  litigation  would  not  materially  affect  the  financial  statements  of  the 
City. 
 

The  City  is  a  member  of  CSAC  Excess  Insurance  Authority.  The  Authority  is  a  member 
directed joint powers insurance pool, which has been operational since October of 1979. The 
purpose of the Authority is to arrange and administer programs for the pooling of self-insured 
losses,  to  purchase  excess  insurance  or  reinsurance,  and  to  arrange  for  group-purchased 
insurance for property and other coverage. 
 
The City participates in the excess workers' compensation and employer's liability programs 
of the Authority. For workers’ compensation, the City has a self-insured retention of $300,000 
per occurrence. For employer’s liability, the City has a self-insured retention of $250,000 per 
occurrence. The City has a pooled retention of $5,000,000 each occurrence, a $45,000,000 
reinsurance layer in excess of the $5,000,000 pooled retention per occurrence for workers' 
compensation claims, and a $5,000,000 employer's liability reinsurance layer per occurrence 
in excess of the $5,000,000 pooled retention. 
 
During  the  past  three  fiscal  years,  none  of  the  above  programs  of  protection  have  had 
settlements  or  judgments  that  exceeded  pooled  or  insured  coverage.  There  has  been  no 
significant reduction in pooled or insured liability coverage from coverage in the prior year.  
 
Self-Insurance Payable 
 
The  City  is  exposed  to  various  risks  of  loss  related  to  torts;  theft  of,  damage  to  and 
destruction of assets; errors and omissions; and injuries to employees. The City established 
two  self-insurance  funds  (Internal  Service  Funds)  to  account  for  and  finance  its  uninsured 
risks  of  loss.  Under  this  program,  the  self-insurance  funds  provide  coverage  for  up  to  a 
maximum of $300,000 for each workers' compensation claim and $250,000 for each general 
liability  claim.  The  City  purchases  commercial  insurance  for  claims  in  excess  of  coverage 
provided by the funds and for all other risks of loss. Settled claims have not exceeded this 
commercial coverage in any of the past three years. All funds of the City participate in the 
program and make payments to the self-insurance funds based on actuarial estimates of the 
amounts needed to pay prior and current year claims. 
 
The  fund  establishes  claims  liabilities  based  on  estimates  of  the  ultimate  cost  of  claims 
(including future claim adjustment expenses) that have been reported but not settled, and of 
claims  that  have  been  incurred  but  not  reported.  The  City  has  accrued  for  its  anticipated 
liability  with  respect  to  claims  filed  and  claims  incurred  but  not  reported  to  the  City  as  of  
year-end.  The  accruals  are  in  the  amounts  of  $1,423,000  and  $671,000  for  the  workers' 
compensation claims and general liability claims, respectively, for a total of $2,094,000. Of 
these amounts, the current year’s adjustment is a decrease of $14,000.

Note 13:   Successor Agency Trust for Assets of the Former Redevelopment Agency 
 

On December 29, 2011, the California Supreme Court upheld Assembly Bill X1 26 (“the Bill”) 
that provides for the dissolution of all redevelopment agencies in the State of California. This 
action impacted the reporting entity of the City of Moreno Valley that previously had reported 
a redevelopment agency within the reporting entity of the City as a blended component unit.  
 
The Bill provides that upon dissolution of a redevelopment agency, either the city or another 
unit of local government will agree to serve as the “successor agency” to hold the assets until 
they are distributed to other units of state and local government. On January 10, 2012, the 
City Council elected to become the Successor Agency for the former redevelopment agency 
in accordance with the Bill as part of City resolution number 2012-04. 
 
After enactment of the law, which occurred on June 28, 2011, redevelopment agencies in the 
State of California cannot enter into new projects, obligations or commitments. Subject to the 
control  of  a  newly  established  oversight  board,  remaining  assets  can  only  be  used  to  pay 
enforceable obligations in existence at the date of dissolution (including the completion of any 
unfinished projects that were subject to legally enforceable contractual commitments).

Note 13:   Successor Agency Trust for Assets of the Former Redevelopment Agency (Continued) 

 
In future fiscal years, successor agencies will only be allocated revenue in the amount that is 
necessary  to  pay  the  estimated  annual  installment  payments  on  enforceable  obligations  of 
the former redevelopment agency until all enforceable obligations of the prior redevelopment 
agency have been paid in full and all assets have been liquidated. 
 
The Bill directed the State Controller of the State of California to review the propriety of any 
transfers of assets between redevelopment agencies and other public bodies that occurred 
after  January  1,  2011.  If  the  public  body  that  received  such  transfers  is  not  contractually 
committed  to  a  third  party  for  the  expenditure  or  encumbrance  of  those  assets,  the  State 
Controller  is  required  to  order  the  available  assets  to  be  transferred  to  the  public  body 
designated as the successor agency by the Bill. 

Management  believes,  in consultation with  legal counsel,  that  the  obligations  of  the  former 
redevelopment  agency  due  to  the  City  are  valid  enforceable  obligations  payable  by  the 
successor agency trust under the requirements of the Bill. The City’s position on this issue is 
not a position of settled law and there is considerable legal uncertainty regarding this issue. It 
is  reasonably  possible  that  a  legal  determination  may  be  made  at  a  later  date  by  an 
appropriate judicial authority that would resolve this issue unfavorably to the City. 

In accordance with the timeline set forth in the Bill (as modified by the California Supreme 
Court  on  December  29,  2011)  all  redevelopment  agencies  in  the  State  of  California  were 
dissolved and ceased to operate as a legal entity as of February 1, 2012. After the date of 
dissolution, the assets and activities of the dissolved redevelopment agency are reported in a 
fiduciary fund (private purpose trust fund) in the financial statements of the City. 
 
On  March  6,  2014,  the  Department  of  Finance  approved  the  Long-Range  Property 
Management  Plan  submitted  by  the  City  and  all  capital  assets  have  been  moved  from  the 
Successor  Agency  to  the  City  as  of  June  30,  2014,  which  will  result  in  an  extraordinary 
gain/(loss) on dissolution of the redevelopment agency in the amount of $26,364,076.

The  Successor  Agency’s  cash  and  investments  are  pooled  with  the  City’s  cash  and 
investment in order to generate optimum interest income. The share of the pooled cash 
account  is  separately  accounted  for,  and  investment  income  is  allocated  to  all 
participating funds based on the relationship of their average daily cash balances to the 
total of the pooled cash and investments. Information regarding the authorized types of 
deposits and investments, the type of risks (i.e. credit, interest rate, custodial, etc.) and 
other disclosures associated with the City's pooled cash and investments is reported in

Loans Payable to the City of Moreno Valley 
 
The Towngate Regional Mall notes (Sears Note), totaling $13,000,000, originated from a 
participation  agreement  (as  amended)  whereby  the  Agency  acquired  certain  parcels 
within the mall for subsequent transfer to major tenants. The notes bear interest of 7.25% 
and  are  payable  solely  from  available  site-generated  property  tax  increment  and  up  to 
50%  of  site-generated  sales  tax.  Furthermore,  the  Agency  had  covenanted  to  use 
reasonable  best  efforts  to  refinance  these  notes  with  Tax  Allocation  Bonds,  provided 
such  financing  is  determined  to  be  fiscally  feasible.  During  2003-2004,  the  City 
purchased the rights to the notes from the holder.  In a letter dated May 26, 2012, the 
California  Department  of  Finance  approved  this  loan  as  an  enforceable  obligation.  At 
June 30, 2014, the outstanding principal and accrued interest balances are $13,000,000 
and $3,331,838 respectively. 
 
The Successor Agency owes the City a total of $652,248 for funds borrowed to finance 
redevelopment activities. $518,520 represents monies borrowed during 2006-2007 by the 
Agency.  $133,728  represents  monies  borrowed  during  2007-2008  by  the  Agency.  The 
interest rate on the borrowings is 12% and repayment of the long-term payable is made 
when funds become available. In a letter dated May 16, 2014, the California Department 
of Finance recalculated the accumulated interest to the LAIF rate.  At June 30, 2014, the 
outstanding principal and accrued interest balances are $652,248 and $14,417. 
 
Note Payable - Price Company 
 
The  former  Redevelopment  Agency  had  recorded  a  long-term  payable  in  the  original 
amount of $2,433,744 under a development and disposition agreement and promissory 
note  with  Price  Company  for  the  reimbursement  of  costs  of  construction  of  a  
130,000-square-foot retail store. The note bears interest at 8% per annum and is payable 
from property tax equal to 50% of site-generated sales tax. Any remainder payable after  
May 2015 will be forgiven. The amount outstanding as of June 30, 2014, was $658,633.

Totals

 

 
Pledged Revenue 
 
The former Redevelopment Agency pledged, as security for bonds issued, either directly 
or through the Financing Authority, a portion of tax increment revenue (including Low and 
Moderate Income Housing set-aside and pass through allocations) that it receives. The 
bonds issued were to provide financing for various capital projects, accomplish Low and 
Moderate  Income Housing  projects  and  to  defease previously  issued  bonds. Assembly 
Bill X1 26 provided that upon dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency, property taxes 
allocated  to  redevelopment  agencies  no  longer  are  deemed  tax  increment  but  rather 
property tax revenues and will be allocated first to successor agencies to make payments 
on the indebtedness incurred by the dissolved redevelopment agency. Total principal and 
interest remaining on the debt is $77,156,139 with annual debt service requirements as 
indicated above. For the current year, the total property tax revenue recognized by the 
Successor  Agency  for  the  payment  of  indebtedness  incurred  by  the  dissolved 
redevelopment agency was $6,305,087 and the debt service obligation on the bonds was 
$2,255,884. 
 
Insurance 

The Successor Agency is covered under the City of Moreno Valley’s insurance policies.  
Therefore, the limitation and self-insured retentions applicable to the City also apply to 
the Successor Agency. Additional information as to coverage and self-insured retentions 
can be found in Note 12.

e.  Commitments and Contingencies 

 

 

Litigation 
 
At June 30, 2014, the Successor Agency was involved as a defendant in several lawsuits 
arising  out  of  the  ordinary  conduct  of  its  affairs.  It  is  the  opinion  of  management  that 
settlements  of  these  lawsuits,  including  losses  for  claims  that  are  incurred  but  not 
reported, if any, will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Successor 
Agency. 
 
Borrowings from the City of Moreno Valley 
 
In  accordance  with  AB  X1  26  which  dissolves 
redevelopment  agencies,  
Section 34171(d)(2) states, in relation to borrowings between the City and the Agency, 
that “for purposes of this part, enforceable obligation does not include any agreements, 
contracts, or arrangements between the city, county, or city and county that created the 
redevelopment  agency.    However,  written  agreements  entered  into  (A)  at  the  time  of 
issuance, but in no event later than December 31, 2010, of indebtedness obligations, and 
(B) solely for the purpose of securing or repaying those indebtedness obligations may be 
deemed  enforceable  obligations  for  the  purposes  of  this  part.  Notwithstanding  this 
paragraph,  loan  agreements  entered  into  between  the  redevelopment  agency  and  the 
city, county, or city and county that created it, within two years of the date of creation of 
the redevelopment agency, may be deemed to be enforceable obligations”. As a result of 
the dissolution of the former redevelopment agency, loans between the City and former 
redevelopment agency totaling $18,759,570 have been removed from these statements. 
The  City  and  Agency  believe  these  are  to  be  upheld  as  viable  enforceable  obligations 
and have been included on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule (ROPS) from 
the Successor Agency, however they have been denied by the Department of Finance at 
this  time.    Upon  receiving  a  Finding  of  Completion  from  the  Department  of  Finance, 
Health and Safety Code Section 34191.4(b) may cause these items to be enforceable in 
future periods; however the result is not determinable at this time. 
 

Note 14:   Fund Balances and Net Position Restatements 
 

Beginning  fund  balances  in  Measure  A  fund  and  Public  Work  Capital  Projects  fund  were 
restated by $577,977 and $2,424,819 respectively to recognize prior year grants revenue. As 
a result, net position was restated by $3,002,796.

Change
2005 to 2014

(1) In 2005 the governor instituted the "triple-flip" which changed the funding source for Vehicle License Fees to the ERAF fund and changed the allocation of funds to cities 
from a per capita computation to the change in the assessed valuation of property. The foundation of the fee is not based on the tax rates established by the City and as such is 
not considered to be property tax. Because this revenue is under the control of the state it would be considered a "shared" revenue rather than an "own-source" revenue.

(2) The decline in sales tax reported in FY 2006 is related to the implementation of the "Triple-Flip" and a take-back of revenues related to a change in the formula that was 
used to allocate funds to the cities. The amount of the take-back was $720,000.

 

(3)  Documentary Transfer Tax has declined since FY 2006.  This decline is due to the combination of a decrease in the number of properties that transferred ownership and 
the decline in the value of properties being transferred.

Notes: 
In late FY 2004 due to budget constraints the State of California discontinued the back-fill of the Vehicle In-Lieu fees which accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total amount paid to local 
government.  In 2005 this "gap" amount was repaid to local agencies which for the City of Moreno Valley amounted to $2,547,036.

The FY 03/04 State of California budget withheld a portion of the Vehicle License Fee back-fill owed to cities. Under the terms of the borrowing the Vehicle License Fee gap loan, as it was known, was to 
be repaid in FY 06/07. The City of Moreno Valley, along with a number of other cities, sold the rights to the receivable to a third party, California Communities, in order to receive the cash on a more 
timely basis. The  agreement resulted in the City receiving a discounted amount or $2,347,317 of the original receivable amount of $2,547,036 in FY 04/05.

In FY 2005 in order to provide collateral for the Budget Deficit Bonds the State of California began withholding twenty five percent of the City's sales tax and replaced it with a like amount from the 
ERAF fund. This switch was one of the components of the "Triple-flip" and unlike the switch of vehicle license fees, which is permanent, only lasts until the bonds are repaid or mature.

Note: In 1978 the voters of the State of California passed Proposition 13 which limited property taxes to a maximum rate of 1% based upon the assessed value of the property being taxed. Each year, the assessed value of the property may 
be increased by an "inflation factor" (limited to a maximum increase of 2%). With few exceptions, property is only reassessed at the time that it is sold to a new owner. At that point, the new assessed value is reassessed at the purchase 
price of the property sold. The assessed valuation data shown above represents the only data currently available with respect to the actual market value of taxable property and is subject to the limitations described above.

**As of January 31, 2012 the Redevelopment Agency was dissolved due to the California Supreme Court passing two bills, AB X1 26 and AB X1 27.

NOTE:
In 1978, California voters passed Proposition 13 which sets the property tax rate at a 1.00% fixed amount. This 1.00% is shared by all taxing agencies for which the subject property resides
within. In addition to the 1.00% fixed amount, property owners are charged taxes as a percentage of assessed property values for the payment of the Metropolitan Water District bonds, the
Eastern Municipal Water District bonds and the Riverside Community College bonds.

Notes: (1) The City began participating in the "Teeter Plan" in FY 1993-94.  The Teeter Plan adopted by the County of Riverside guarantees each participating city 
payment equal to 100% of the total tax value.  Any delinquencies and the associated penalties and interest are collected and maintained by the County.

Supplemental taxes for new construction put into service after the tax rolls are completed are collected in a county pool and then allocated to all cities based on a 
formula.  Because these tax amounts are not included on the original tax roll these amounts are reported as collections but are not included in the amount levied.

            (2) Beginning in 2013 the Redevelopment Tax Increment was no longer included in the calculation for the levy and the collections.

General bonded debt is debt payable with governmental fund resources and general obligation bonds recorded in 
enterprise funds (of which the City has none).

1) Assessed value has been used because the actual value of taxable property is not readily available in the State 
of California.

2) GASB 44 allowed for the implementation of historical reporting on a prospective basis. The City has elected to 
report historical data in this manner. 

3) In Fiscal Year 2011 the City defeased the 1997 Lease Revenue Bonds and the 1997 City Hall COPs with private 
placement financing.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 

 

To the Directors 
City of Moreno Valley, California 
Community Services District 
 
Report on Financial Statements  
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, 
and  the  aggregate  remaining  fund  information  of  the  City  of  Moreno  Valley,  California,  Community 
Services District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014, and the related notes to the 
financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements as listed in the 
table of contents. 
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  these  financial  statements  in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the  design,  implementation,  and  maintenance  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  preparation  and  fair 
presentation  of  financial  statements  that  are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or 
error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 
standards  applicable  to  financial  audits  contained  in  Government  Auditing  Standards,  issued  by  the 
Comptroller  General  of  the  United  States;  and  the  State  Controller’s  Minimum  Audit  Requirements  for 
California  Special  Districts.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the  financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the 
assessment  of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or 
error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating 
the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  significant  accounting 
estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial 
statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinions.

To the Directors  
City of Moreno Valley, California 
Community Services District 

Opinions 
 
In  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the 
respective financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining 
fund information of the District as of June 30, 2014, and the respective changes in financial position and 
budgetary  comparison  for  Zone  L  Library  Services,  Zone  A  Parks  and  Community  Services,  Zone  B 
Street Lights and Zone E Extensive Landscape Administration for the year then ended in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
Other Matters 
 
Required Supplementary Information 
 
Management has omitted the management’s discussion and analysis that accounting principles generally 
accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  require  to  be  presented  to  supplement  the  basic  financial 
statements. Such missing information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by 
the  Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board,  who  considers  it  to  be  an  essential  part  of  financial 
reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical 
context. Our opinion on the basic financial statements is not affected by this missing information. 
 
Other Information 
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively 
comprise the District’s basic financial statements. The combining and individual nonmajor fund financial 
statements and schedules are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of 
the basic financial statements. 
 
The combining and individual nonmajor fund financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of 
management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records 
used  to  prepare  the  basic  financial  statements.  Such  information  has  been  subjected  to  the  auditing 
procedures  applied  in  the  audit  of  the  basic  financial  statements  and  certain  additional  procedures, 
including  comparing  and  reconciling  such  information  directly  to  the  underlying  accounting  and  other 
records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, 
and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America. In our opinion, the combining and individual nonmajor fund financial statements and 
schedules  are  fairly  stated,  in  all  material  respects,  in  relation  to  the  basic  financial  statements  as  a 
whole.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

a.  Description of the Reporting Entity 
 

 
Note 1: 
 

The  City  of  Moreno  Valley,  California,  Community  Services  District  (the  District),  was 
created by a City Council ordinance adopted on December 3, 1984.  Its purpose is to act 
as  a  legal  entity,  separate  and  distinct  from  the  City  of  Moreno Valley  (the  City),  even 
though the City Council is currently serving as the District’s Governing Board. The District 
is broadly empowered to engage in the general maintenance and administration of the 
City’s community programs. 
 
Governmental  Accounting  Standards  define 
the  primary 
government and those component units for which the primary government is financially 
accountable.  Financial accountability is defined as appointment of a voting majority of 
the  component  unit’s  board,  and  either:    a)  the  primary  government  has  the  ability  to 
impose its will, or b) the possibility that the component unit will provide a financial benefit 
to, or impose a financial burden on the primary government.  Since the City Council of the 
City  of  Moreno  Valley  also  serves  as  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District,  the  City,  in 
effect,  has  the  ability  to  influence  and  control  operations.  Therefore,  the  City  has 
oversight  responsibility 
the  criteria  of 
Governmental Accounting Standards, the financial statements of the District are included 
in the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.  The District has the same fiscal 
year end as the City and its financial statements can be obtained from the City Clerk. 
 

the  District.  Accordingly, 

the  reporting  entity  as 

in  applying 

for 

b.  Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements 

 
The  government-wide  financial  statements  (i.e.,  the  statement  of  net  position  and  the 
statement of activities) report information on the component unit.  For the most part, the 
effect of interfund activity has been removed from these statements. 
 
The statement  of  activities  demonstrates  the  degree  to which  the  direct expenses of  a 
given function or segment are offset by program revenues.  Direct expenses are those 
that  are  clearly  identifiable  with  a  specific  function  or  segment.  Program  revenues 
include:  1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use or directly benefit from 
goods, services or privileges provided by a given function or segment, and 2) grants and 
contributions that  are restricted  to  meeting  the  operational  or capital  requirements  of  a 
particular  function  or  segment.  Taxes  and  other  items  not  properly  included  among 
program revenues are reported instead as general revenues. 
 
Major  individual  governmental  funds  are  reported  as  separate  columns  in  the  fund 
financial statements. 
 

c.  Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation 

 
The  government-wide  financial  statements  are  reported  using  the  economic  resources 
measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting.  Revenues are recorded when 
earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of 
related cash flows.  Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they 
have been levied.  Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all 
eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met.

if 

revenues 

to  be  available 

Government fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources 
measurement  focus  and  the  modified  accrual  basis  of  accounting.  Revenues  are 
recognized  as  soon  as  they  are  both  measurable  and  available.  Revenues  are 
considered  to  be  available  when  they  are  collectible  within  the  current  period  or  soon 
enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the government 
considers  operating 
they  are  collected  within  
60 days of the end of the current fiscal period, while grant revenues have an availability 
period of 120 days. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as 
under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures are recorded only when 
payment is due. 
 
Property taxes and interest associated with the current fiscal period are all considered to 
be susceptible to accrual and so have been recognized as revenues of the current fiscal 
period.  Only the portion of special assessments receivable due within the current fiscal 
period is considered to be susceptible to accrual as revenue of the current period.  All 
other revenue items are considered to be measurable and available only when cash is 
received by the government. 
 
The District reports the following major governmental funds: 
 

Zone  L  Library  Services  accounts  for  the  operations  necessary  to  process  and 
administer the library services program. 
 
Zone  A  Parks  and  Community  Services  accounts  for  the  administration  and 
maintenance of the parks and community services facilities and programs. 
 
Zone B Street Lights accounts for the operations necessary to provide residential 
subdivision street lighting. 
 
Zone  E  Extensive  Landscaping  Administration  accounts  for  the  operations 
necessary  to  provide  high-service  level  landscape  maintenance  in  and  around 
specific major residential developments. 

d.  Budgetary Reporting 

 
Budgets  are  legally  adopted  and  formal  budgetary  integration  is  employed  as  a 
management  control  device  during  the  year  for  the  governmental  activities.  Budgets 
presented in this report for comparison to actual amounts are presented in accordance 
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP).  From  the  effective  date  of  the 
budget, the amounts stated therein as proposed expenditures become appropriations to 
the various District departments. 
 
Reported  budget  amounts  represent  the  original  legally  adopted  budget  as  amended.  
The City Council may amend the budget only by a duly adopted minute resolution during 
a regular meeting, providing that sufficient monies are available and that expenditures of 
proceeds of taxes will not be increased beyond the constitutional appropriation limit as 
imposed by Article XIIIB of the State Constitution. 
 
Individual fund budgets are, in all cases where appropriations are required, the same as 
the  appropriation  amounts.    In  the  case  of  the  Governmental  Fund  type,  unexpended 
budgeted amounts, except for amounts relating to capital projects, lapse at the end of the

budget  year.  Spending  control  for  most  funds  is  established  by  the  amount  of 
expenditures budgeted for each department within the fund, but management control is 
exercised at budgetary line item levels within the departments. Management can transfer 
budgeted amounts between line items within each department provided that they do not 
increase  or  decrease  total  department  appropriations.  Expenditures  may  not  legally 
exceed budgeted appropriations at the department and fund levels. 
 
For  the  year  ended  June  30,  2014,  there  were  no  funds  that  had  in  excess  of 
appropriations adopted by City Council. 
 

e.  Unavailable Revenue and Unearned Revenue 

f.  Fund Balance 

The District reports unavailable revenue in the fund-level statements as deferred inflows. 
Unavailable revenue arises when potential revenue does not meet both the "measurable" 
and "available" criteria for recognition in the current period. In subsequent periods, when 
both  revenue  recognition criteria  are met,  or when  the  District  has  a  legal claim  to  the 
resources,  the  deferred  inflow  for  unavailable  revenue  is  removed  and  revenue  is 
recognized. 
 
The District reports unearned revenue in the fund-level statements and in the statement 
of net position. Unearned revenue arises when the District receives resources before it 
has a legal claim to them, as when grant monies are received prior to the incurrence of 
qualifying expenditures. 
 

 
In  the  fund  financial  statements,  government  funds  report  the  following  fund  balance 
classifications: 
 

Nonspendable  include  amounts  that  cannot  be  spent  because  they  are  either  
(a)  not  in  spendable  form  or  (b)  legally  or  contractually  required  to  be  maintained 
intact. 
 
Restricted  include  amounts  that  are  constrained  on  the  use  of  resources  by  either  
(a)  external  creditors,  grantors,  contributors,  or  laws  of  regulations  of  other 
governments or (b) by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.  
 
Committed include amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to 
constraints  imposed  by  formal  action  of  the  government’s  highest  authority,  the 
Governing Board.  The formal action that is required to be taken to establish, modify, 
or rescind a fund balance commitment is a resolution by the governing body. 
 
Assigned include amounts that are constrained by the government’s intent to be used 
for  specific  purposes,  but  are  neither  restricted  nor  committed.  The  Financial  and 
Management Services Director is authorized to assign amounts to a specific purpose, 
which was established by the governing body in a resolution.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 
Unassigned include the residual amounts that have not been restricted, committed, 
or assigned to specific purposes. 
 

Fund Balance Flow Assumptions 
 

Sometimes  the  government  will  fund  outlays  for  a  particular  purpose  from  both 
restricted  and  unrestricted  resources  (the  total  of  committed,  assigned,  and 
unassigned fund balance). In order to calculate the amounts to report as restricted, 
committed,  assigned,  and  unassigned  fund  balance  in  the  governmental  fund 
financial statements a flow assumption must be made about the order in which the 
resources  are  considered  to  be  applied.  It  is  the  government’s  policy  to  consider 
restricted fund balance to have been depleted before using any of the components of 
unrestricted  fund  balance.  Further,  when  the  components  of  unrestricted  fund 
balance can be used for the same purpose, committed fund balance is depleted first, 
followed by assigned fund balance. Unassigned fund balance is applied last. 

g.  Net Position 

 
In  the  government-wide  financial  statements,  net  position  is  classified  in  the  following 
categories:  

 
Net  Investment  in  Capital  Assets  –  This  amount  consists  of  capital  assets  net  of 
accumulated depreciation and reduced by outstanding debt that is attributed to the 
acquisition,  construction,  or  improvement  of  the assets.  Currently,  the  District does 
not have any debt attributed to capital assets. 
 
Restricted  Net  Position  –  This  amount  is  restricted  by  external  creditors,  grantors, 
contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments. 

Net Position Flow Assumption 
 

Sometimes  the  government  will  fund  outlays  for  a  particular  purpose  from  both 
restricted  (e.g.,  restricted  bond  or  grant  proceeds)  and  unrestricted  resources.  In 
order to calculate the amounts to report as restricted – net position and unrestricted – 
net position in the government-wide financial statements, a flow assumption must be 
made about the order in which the resources are considered to be applied. It is the 
government’s  policy  to  consider  restricted  –  net  position  to  have  been  depleted 
before unrestricted – net position is applied. 

 

h.  Capital Assets 
 

Capital  assets,  which  include  property,  plant,  equipment  and  infrastructure  assets  
(e.g. streetlights, medians, sidewalks and similar items), are reported in the government-
wide  financial  statements.  Capital  assets  are  defined  by  the  District  as  assets  with  an 
initial, individual cost of more than $5,000 (amount not rounded) and an estimated useful 
life  in  excess  of  two  years.  Such  assets  are  recorded  at  historical  cost  or  estimated 
historical  cost  if  purchased  or  constructed.    Donated  capital  assets  are  recorded  at 
estimated fair market value at the date of donation.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or 
materially extend assets lives are not capitalized. 
 
Major  outlays  for  capital  assets  and  improvements  are  capitalized  as  projects  are 
constructed. 
 
Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  over  the 
following estimated useful lives:

Buildings and Improvements 
Furniture and Equipment 
Vehicles 
Infrastructure 
 
Investments 

i. 
 

Years 
5 – 50 
3 – 15 
3 – 10 
25 – 50  

The District records all investments at fair value.  The current year’s changes in fair value 
are recognized in the statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances 
as  use  of  money  and  property.  Use  of  money  and  property  includes  interest  earnings, 
changes in fair value, rental income and any gains or losses. 

j.  Salary Expenditures 
 

k.  Property Taxes 
 

The  District  does  not  employ  any  personnel  and  relies  on  the  City  for  administrative 
services.  The  financial  statements  include  expenditures  for  salary  and  other  benefits, 
which were allocated to the District by the City. 
 

Property  taxes  attach  as  an  enforceable  lien  on  property  as  of  January  1.  Secured 
property  taxes  are  levied  on  August  10  and  are  payable  in  two  installments  on  
November  1  and  February  1.  Unsecured  personal  property  taxes  are  due  in  a  single 
installment on July 1.  The County of Riverside bills and collects the property taxes and 
remits them to the District in installments during the year. Property taxes received within 
60 days after the District’s fiscal year-end are considered “measurable” and “available” 
and are accrued in the District’s financial statements. 
 

l.  Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent 
assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  related  reported 
amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could 
differ from estimates.

Cash and Investments 

Cash  and  investments  reported  in  the  accompanying  financial  statements  consisted  of  the 
following: 
 

Cash and investments pooled with the City 
 

$13,807,767 

The  District’s  cash  and  investments  are  pooled  with  the  City  of  Moreno  Valley’s  cash  and 
investments  in  order  to  generate  optimum  investment  income.  The  District  is  a  voluntary 
participant in the City’s investment pool. This pool is governed by and under the regulatory 
oversight of the Investment Policy adopted by the City Council of the City. The District has 
not  adopted  an  investment  policy  separate  from  that  of  the  City.  Each  fund's  share  of  the 
pooled cash account is separately accounted for, and investment income is allocated to all 
participating funds based on the relationship of their average daily cash balances to the total 
of the pooled cash and investments.  Information regarding the authorized types of deposits 
and  investments,  the  type  of  risks  (i.e.  credit,  interest  rate,  custodial,  etc.)  and  other 
disclosures associated with the City's pooled cash and investments is included in the City's 
basic financial statements, which are available at City Hall.

The  District  is  exposed  to  various  risks  of  loss  related  to  torts;  theft  of,  damage  to  and 
destruction  of  assets;  errors  and  omissions;  and  injuries  to  employees.  The  City  of  
Moreno Valley established two Self-Insurance Funds (internal service funds) to account for 
and finance its uninsured risks of loss.  Under this program, the self-insurance funds provide 
coverage  for  up  to  a  maximum  of  $300,000  for  each  worker’s  compensation  claim  and 
$250,000 for each general liability claim. The City purchases commercial insurance for claims 
in  excess  of  coverage  provided  by  the  funds  and  for  all  other  risks  of  loss.  Settled  claims 
have not exceeded this commercial coverage in any of the past three years.  All funds of the 
District participate in the program and make payments to the Self-Insurance Funds based on 
actuarial estimates of the amounts needed to pay prior and current year claims.

APPENDIX C 

PROPOSED FORM OF BOND COUNSEL OPINION 

Upon issuance of the Series 2015 Bonds, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the 
Authority,  proposes  to  render  its  final  approving  opinion  with  respect  to  the  Series  2015  Bonds  in 
substantially the following form: 

[Date of Delivery] 

 

Moreno Valley Public Financing Authority 
Moreno Valley, California 
 
 

Moreno Valley Public Financing Authority 
Lease Revenue Bonds, Series 2015 (Taxable) 

(Final Opinion) 

 
Ladies and Gentlemen: 
 

We have acted as bond counsel to the Moreno Valley Public Financing Authority (the “Authority”) in 
connection with the issuance of $10,430,000 aggregate principal amount of Moreno Valley Public Financing 
Authority  Lease  Revenue  Bonds,  Series  2015  (Taxable)  (the  “Series  2015  Bonds”),  issued  pursuant  to  a 
Master Trust Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2015 (the “Trust Agreement”), between the Authority and 
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined 
herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Trust Agreement. 

In such connection, we have reviewed a Master Facilities Lease, dated as of December 1, 2015 (the 
“Facilities Lease”), between the City of Moreno Valley (the “City”), as lessor, and the Authority, as lessee; 
Master Facilities Sublease, dated as of December 1, 2015 (the “Facilities Sublease”), between the Authority, as 
lessor, and the City, as lessee; the Trust Agreement; opinions of counsel to the Authority, the City and the 
Trustee; certificates of the Authority, the City, the Trustee and others; and such other documents, opinions and 
matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein. 

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court 
decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities.  Such opinions may be affected 
by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof.  We have not undertaken to determine, or 
to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters 
come  to  our  attention  after  the  date  hereof.    Accordingly,  this  letter  speaks  only  as  of  its  date  and  is  not 
intended  to,  and  may  not,  be  relied  upon  or  otherwise  used  in  connection  with any  such  actions,  events  or 
matters.  Our engagement with respect to the Series 2015 Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we 
disclaim  any  obligation  to  update  this  letter.    We  have  assumed  the  genuineness  of  all  documents  and 
signatures  presented to  us  (whether as originals  or as copies)  and  the due  and  legal  execution  and delivery 
thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than the Authority and the City.  We have assumed, without 
undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, 
and  of  the  legal  conclusions  contained  in  the  opinions,  referred  to  in  the  second  paragraph  hereof.  
Furthermore,  we  have  assumed  compliance  with  all  covenants  and  agreements  contained  in  the  Facilities 
Lease,  the  Facilities  Sublease  and  the  Trust  Agreement.    We  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  rights  and 
obligations under the Series 2015 Bonds, the Facilities Lease, the Facilities Sublease and the Trust Agreement 
and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, 
fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application 
of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases, and to the limitations on legal 

 

C-1 

 

remedies against joint powers authorities and cities in the State of California.  We express no opinion with 
respect  to  any  indemnification,  contribution,  liquidated  damages,  penalty  (including  any  remedy  deemed  to 
constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of 
venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents 
nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the real or 
personal property described in or as subject to the lien of the Facilities Lease, the Facilities Sublease or the 
Trust  Agreement  or  the  accuracy  or  sufficiency  of  the  description  contained  therein  of,  or  the  remedies 
available  to  enforce  liens  on,  any  such  property.    Our  services  did  not  include  financial  or  other  non-legal 
advice.    Finally,  we  undertake  no  responsibility  for  the  accuracy,  completeness  or  fairness  of  the  Official 
Statement or other offering  material relating to the Series 2015 Bonds and express no opinion with respect 
thereto. 

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the 

following opinions: 

1. 

The Series 2015 Bonds constitute the valid and binding limited obligations of the Authority. 

2. 

The Trust Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes the valid and 
binding obligation of, the Authority.  The Trust Agreement creates a valid pledge, to secure the payment of the 
principal of and interest on the Series 2015 Bonds, of the Revenues and any other amounts held by the Trustee 
in any fund or account established pursuant to the Trust Agreement, except the Rebate Fund, subject to the 
provisions of the Trust Agreement permitting the application thereof for the purposes and on the terms and 
conditions set forth in the Trust Agreement. 

3. 

The Facilities Lease and the Facilities Sublease have been duly executed and delivered by, 

and constitute the valid and binding obligations of, the Authority and the City. 

4. 

Interest on the Series 2015 Bonds is exempt from State of California personal income taxes.  
We  express  no  opinion  regarding  other  tax  consequences  related  to  the  ownership  or  disposition  of,  or  the 
amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Series 2015 Bonds. 

Faithfully yours,

APPENDIX E 

BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM 

The  information  in  this  Appendix  concerning  DTC  and  DTC’s  book-entry  only  system  has  been 
obtained from sources that the Authority, the City and the Underwriter believe to be reliable, but none of the 
Authority, the City or the Underwriter takes any responsibility for the completeness or accuracy thereof.  The 
following description of the procedures and record keeping with respect to beneficial ownership interests in 
the Series 2015 Bonds, payment of principal, premium, if any, accreted value and interest on the Series 2015 
Bonds to DTC Participants or Beneficial Owners, confirmation and transfers of beneficial ownership interests 
in the Series 2015 Bonds and other related transactions by and between DTC, the DTC Participants and the 
Beneficial Owners is based solely on information provided by DTC.  

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the Series 
2015 Bonds.  The Series 2015 Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & 
Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  
One fully registered bond will be issued for each annual maturity of the Series 2015 Bonds, each in the aggregate 
principal amount of such annual maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. 

DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New 
York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the 
Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, 
and  a  “clearing  agency”  registered  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Section  17A  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of 
1934.    DTC  holds  and  provides  asset  servicing  for  over  3.5  million  issues  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  equity  issues, 
corporate  and  municipal  debt  issues,  and  money  market  instruments  (from  over  100  countries)  that  DTC’s 
participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC.  DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct 
Participants  of  sales  and  other  securities  transactions  in  deposited  securities,  through  electronic  computerized 
book-entry  transfers  and  pledges  between  Direct  Participants’  accounts.    This  eliminates  the  need  for  physical 
movement  of  securities  certificates.    Direct  Participants  include  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  securities  brokers  and 
dealers,  banks,  trust  companies,  clearing  corporations,  and  certain  other  organizations.    DTC  is  a  wholly-owned 
subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”).  DTCC is the holding company for DTC, 
National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  and  Fixed  Income  Clearing  Corporation,  all  of  which  are  registered 
clearing agencies.  DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries.  Access to the DTC system is also 
available  to  others  such  as  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  securities  brokers  and  dealers,  banks,  trust  companies,  and 
clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly 
or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).  DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+.  The DTC Rules applicable to 
its  Participants  are on  file  with  the Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.    More  information  about DTC  can be 
found at www.dtcc.com. 

Purchases of Series 2015 Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, 
which will receive a credit for the Series 2015 Bonds on DTC’s records.  The ownership interest of each actual 
purchaser  of  each  Series  2015  Bond  (“Beneficial  Owner”)  is  in  turn  to  be  recorded  on  the  Direct  and  Indirect 
Participants’  records.    Beneficial  Owners  will  not  receive  written  confirmation  from  DTC  of  their  purchase.  
Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as 
well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial 
Owner  entered  into  the  transaction.    Transfers  of  ownership  interests  in  the  Series  2015  Bonds  are  to  be 
accomplished  by  entries  made  on  the  books  of  Direct  and  Indirect  Participants  acting  on  behalf  of  Beneficial 
Owners.  Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the Series 2015 
Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Series 2015 Bonds is discontinued. 

To  facilitate  subsequent  transfers,  all  Series  2015  Bonds deposited by  Direct  Participants  with  DTC  are 
registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an 
authorized representative of DTC.  The deposit of Series 2015 Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of 
Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership.  DTC has no knowledge 
of  the  actual  Beneficial  Owners  of  the  Series  2015  Bonds;  DTC’s  records  reflect  only  the  identity  of  the  Direct

Participants  to  whose  accounts  such  Series  2015  Bonds  are  credited,  which  may  or  may  not  be  the  Beneficial 
Owners.    The  Direct  and  Indirect  Participants  will  remain  responsible  for  keeping  account  of  their  holdings  on 
behalf of their customers. 

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to 
Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by 
arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  
Beneficial  Owners  of Series 2015  Bonds  may  wish  to  take  certain  steps  to  augment  the  transmission  to  them  of 
notices  of  significant  events  with  respect  to  the  Series  2015  Bonds,  such  as  redemptions,  tenders,  defaults,  and 
proposed amendments to the Series 2015 Bond documents.  For example, Beneficial Owners of Series 2015 Bonds 
may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Series 2015 Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and 
transmit notices to Beneficial Owners.  In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and 
addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices be provided directly to them. 

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC.  If less than all of the Series 2015 Bonds within a maturity are 
being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such 
maturity to be redeemed. 

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Series 
2015 Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures.  Under its usual 
procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Authority as soon as possible after the record date.  The Omnibus 
Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Series 2015 
Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). 

Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Series 2015 Bonds will be made to Cede 
& Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  DTC’s practice is to 
credit  Direct  Participants’  accounts  upon  DTC’s  receipt  of  funds  and  corresponding  detail  information  from  the 
Authority or the Trustee, on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records.  
Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, 
as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and 
will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, the Trustee, or the Authority, subject to any statutory 
or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, 
and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative 
of DTC) is the responsibility of the Authority or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants 
will  be  the  responsibility  of  DTC,  and  disbursement  of  such  payments  to  the  Beneficial  Owners  will  be  the 
responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. 

A Series 2015 Bond Owner shall give notice to elect to have its Series 2015 Bonds purchased or tendered, 
through its Participant, to the Trustee, and shall effect delivery of such Series 2015 Bonds by causing the Direct 
Participant to transfer the Participant’s interest in the Series 2015 Bonds, on DTC’s records, to the Trustee.  The 
requirement  for  physical  delivery  of  Series  2015  Bonds  in  connection  with  an  optional  tender  or  a  mandatory 
purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Series 2015 Bonds are transferred by Direct 
Participants on DTC’s records and followed by a book-entry credit of tendered Series 2015 Bonds to the Trustee’s 
DTC account.  DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Series 2015 Bonds at 
any time by giving reasonable notice to the Authority or the Trustee.  Under such circumstances, in the event that a 
successor depository is not obtained, physical certificates are required to be printed and delivered.   

The Authority may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry only transfers through DTC (or a 

successor securities depository).  In that event, bonds will be printed and delivered to DTC. 

THE TRUSTEE, AS LONG AS A BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM IS USED FOR THE SERIES 2015 
BONDS, WILL SEND ANY NOTICE OF REDEMPTION OR OTHER NOTICES TO OWNERS ONLY TO DTC.  
ANY  FAILURE  OF  DTC  TO  ADVISE  ANY  DTC  PARTICIPANT,  OR  OF  ANY  DTC  PARTICIPANT  TO 
NOTIFY  ANY  BENEFICIAL  OWNER,  OF  ANY  NOTICE  AND  ITS  CONTENT  OR  EFFECT  WILL  NOT 
AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF SUFFICIENCY OF THE PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THE REDEMPTION 
OF THE SERIES 2015 BONDS CALLED FOR REDEMPTION OR OF ANY OTHER ACTION PREMISED ON 
SUCH NOTICE.

ASSURED  GUARANTY  MUNICIPAL  CORP.  ("AGM"),  for  consideration  received,  hereby
UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY agrees to pay to the trustee (the "Trustee") or paying agent (the
"Paying Agent") (as set forth in the documentation providing for the issuance of and securing the Bonds)  for
the Bonds, for the benefit of the Owners or, at the election of AGM, directly to each Owner, subject only to
the  terms  of  this  Policy  (which  includes  each  endorsement  hereto),  that  portion  of  the  principal  of  and
interest on the Bonds that shall become Due for Payment but shall be unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by
the Issuer.

 
On  the  later  of  the  day  on  which  such  principal  and  interest  becomes  Due  for  Payment  or  the
Business Day next following the Business Day on which AGM shall have received Notice of Nonpayment,
AGM will disburse to or for the benefit of each Owner of a Bond the face amount of principal of and interest
on the Bond that is then Due for Payment but is then unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Issuer, but
only upon receipt by AGM, in a form reasonably satisfactory to  it, of (a) evidence of the Owner's right to
receive  payment  of  the  principal  or  interest  then  Due  for  Payment  and  (b)  evidence,  including  any
appropriate  instruments  of  assignment,  that  all  of  the  Owner's  rights  with  respect  to  payment  of  such
principal or interest that is Due for Payment shall thereupon vest in AGM.  A Notice of Nonpayment will be
deemed  received  on  a given  Business  Day  if  it  is  received  prior  to  1:00 p.m.  (New  York  time)  on  such
Business  Day;  otherwise,  it  will  be  deemed  received  on  the  next  Business  Day.    If  any  Notice  of
Nonpayment received by AGM  is incomplete,  it  shall be deemed not to have been received by AGM for
purposes  of  the  preceding  sentence  and  AGM  shall  promptly  so  advise  the  Trustee,  Paying  Agent  or
Owner,  as  appropriate,  who  may  submit  an  amended  Notice  of  Nonpayment.    Upon  disbursement  in
respect of a Bond, AGM shall become the owner of the Bond, any appurtenant coupon to the Bond or right
to receipt of payment of principal of or interest on the Bond and shall be fully subrogated to the rights of the
Owner, including the Owner's right to receive payments under the Bond, to the extent of any payment by
AGM hereunder.  Payment by AGM to the Trustee or Paying Agent for the benefit of the Owners shall, to
the extent thereof, discharge the obligation of AGM under this Policy.

 
Except to the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, the following terms shall have
the meanings specified  for all  purposes of this Policy.    "Business  Day"  means  any  day  other  than (a)  a
Saturday  or Sunday  or (b)  a day  on  which banking  institutions  in  the State of New  York or  the  Insurer's
Fiscal  Agent  are authorized  or  required by  law or  executive order to remain closed.   "Due  for  Payment"
means (a) when referring to the principal of a Bond, payable on the stated maturity date thereof or the date
on which the same shall have been duly called for mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to
any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking
fund  redemption),  acceleration  or  other  advancement  of  maturity  unless  AGM  shall  elect,  in  its  sole
discretion, to pay such principal due upon such acceleration together with any accrued interest to the date
of  acceleration  and  (b) when referring to  interest on  a Bond, payable  on the stated date  for payment  of
interest.  "Nonpayment" means, in  respect of a Bond, the failure of the Issuer to have provided sufficient
funds to the Trustee or, if there is no Trustee, to the Paying Agent for payment in full of all principal and
interest that is Due for Payment on such Bond.  "Nonpayment" shall also include, in respect of a Bond, any
payment of principal or interest that is Due for Payment made to an Owner by or on behalf of the Issuer

United States Bankruptcy Code by a trustee in bankruptcy in accordance with a final, nonappealable order
of  a  court  having  competent  jurisdiction.    "Notice"  means  telephonic  or  telecopied  notice,  subsequently
confirmed in a signed writing, or written notice by registered or certified mail, from an Owner, the Trustee or
the Paying Agent to AGM which notice shall specify (a) the person or entity making the claim, (b) the Policy
Number, (c) the claimed amount and (d) the date such claimed amount became Due for Payment.  "Owner"
means, in respect of a Bond, the person or entity who, at the time of Nonpayment, is entitled under the
terms of such Bond to payment thereof, except that "Owner" shall not include the Issuer or any person or
entity whose direct or indirect obligation constitutes the underlying security for the Bonds.

 
AGM  may  appoint  a  fiscal  agent  (the  "Insurer's  Fiscal  Agent")  for  purposes  of  this  Policy  by
giving written notice to the Trustee and the Paying Agent specifying  the name and notice address of  the
Insurer's Fiscal Agent.  From and after the date of receipt of such notice by the Trustee and the Paying
Agent,  (a)  copies  of  all  notices  required  to  be  delivered  to  AGM  pursuant  to  this  Policy  shall  be
simultaneously delivered to the Insurer's Fiscal Agent and to AGM and shall not be deemed received until
received by both and (b) all payments required to be made by AGM under this Policy may be made directly
by AGM or by the Insurer's Fiscal Agent on behalf of AGM.  The Insurer's Fiscal Agent is the agent of AGM
only and the Insurer's Fiscal Agent shall in no event be liable to any Owner for any act of the Insurer's Fiscal
Agent or any failure of AGM to deposit or cause to be deposited sufficient funds to make payments due
under this Policy.

 
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, AGM agrees not to assert, and hereby waives,
only for the benefit of each Owner, all rights (whether by counterclaim, setoff or otherwise) and defenses
(including,  without  limitation,  the  defense  of  fraud),  whether  acquired  by  subrogation,  assignment  or
otherwise,  to  the extent that such rights and defenses may be available  to AGM to  avoid  payment of its
obligations under this Policy in accordance with the express provisions of this Policy.

 
This  Policy  sets  forth  in  full  the  undertaking  of  AGM,  and  shall  not  be  modified,  altered  or
affected by any other agreement or instrument, including any modification or amendment thereto.  Except to
the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, (a) any premium paid in respect of this Policy is
nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever, including payment, or provision being made for payment, of the
Bonds  prior  to  maturity  and  (b)  this  Policy  may  not  be  canceled  or  revoked.      THIS  POLICY  IS  NOT
COVERED BY THE PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE SECURITY FUND SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 76
OF THE NEW YORK INSURANCE LAW.
