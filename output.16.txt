Education  Code  of  the  State  of  California  (the  “Act”)  and  other  applicable  law,  and  pursuant  to  resolutions 
adopted by the Board of Trustees of the District on December 6, 2005 (the “Resolution”).  The District received 
authorization at an election held on March 2, 2004, by an affirmative vote of more than 55% of the votes cast by 
eligible voters within the District (the “Authorization”) to issue not to exceed $36,000,000 of general obligation 
bonds (the “Bonds”).  In October 2004, the District issued the first series of Bonds in a principal amount of

facilities and equipment for the District.  The District intends to use the proceeds of the Bonds for the following: 
plumbing and electrical systems; improve school safety and security; upgrade classroom technology; build and

Security 

The Board of Supervisors of the County has power and is obligated to annually levy ad valorem taxes 
for the payment of the Bonds and the interest thereon upon all property within the District subject to taxation by 
the District without limitation of rate or amount (except certain personal property which is taxable at limited 
rates).  Such taxes will be levied annually in addition to all other taxes during the period that the Bonds are 
outstanding in an amount sufficient to pay the principal and Maturity Value of and interest on the Bonds when 
due.    Such  taxes,  when  collected,  will  be  deposited  into  the  Apple  Valley  Unified  School  District  General 
Obligation Bond Debt Service Fund, defined herein, which is maintained by the County and which is required 
by the Act to be applied for the payment of principal and Maturity Value of and interest on the Bonds when due.  
Although the County is obligated to levy an ad valorem tax for the payment of the Bonds and to make timely 
payment of principal and Maturity Value of and interest on the Bonds when due, and will maintain the Debt 
Service Fund, the Bonds are not a debt of the County. 

The moneys in the Debt Service Fund, to the extent necessary to pay the principal and Maturity Value 
of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds as the same becomes due and payable, shall be remitted by U.S. 
Bank  National  Association  as  Paying  Agent  (as  defined  herein)  to  DTC  for  remittance  of  such  principal, 
Maturity  Value  of,  premium,  if  any,  and  interest  to  its  Participants  (as  defined  herein)  for  subsequent 
disbursement to the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds. 

The amount of the annual ad valorem tax levied by the County to repay the Bonds will be determined 
by the relationship between the assessed valuation of taxable property in the District and the amount of debt 
service  due  on  the  Bonds.    Fluctuations  in  the  annual  debt  service  on  the  Bonds  and  the  assessed  value  of 
taxable property in the District may cause the annual tax rate to fluctuate. Economic and other factors beyond 
the  District’s  control,  such  as  a  general  market  decline  in  land  values,  reclassification  of  property  to  a  class 
exempt  from  taxation,  whether  by  ownership  or  use  (such  as  exemption  for  property  owned  by  State  of 
California (the “State”) and local agencies and property used for qualified educational, hospital, charitable or 
religious  purposes),  or the complete or partial destruction of taxable property caused by natural or manmade 
disaster,  such  as  earthquake,  flood,  or  toxic  contamination,  could  cause  a  reduction  in  the  assessed  value  of 
taxable property within the District and necessitate a corresponding increase in the annual tax rate.  For further 
information regarding the District’s assessed valuation, tax rates, overlapping debt, and other matters concerning 
taxation, see “TAX BASE FOR REPAYMENT OF BONDS” herein. 

Description of the Bonds 

The Bonds will be issued in book-entry form only and will be initially issued and registered in the name 

of Cede & Co.  Purchasers will not receive certificates representing their interests in the Bonds. 

Current Interest Bonds.  Interest with respect to the Current Interest Bonds accrues from the Date of 
Delivery, and is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year commencing August 1, 2006.  
Interest  on  the  Current  Interest  Bonds  shall  be  computed  on  the  basis  of  a  360-day  year  of  twelve  30-day 
months.  Interest payments on any Current Interest Bond shall be made to the person appearing on the Bond 
Register as the Owner thereof as the Record Date immediately preceding such payment date, such interest to be 
paid by check mailed to such Owner on the Interest Payment Date at the address appearing on the Bond Register 
or  at  such  other  address  as  may  be  filed  with  the  Paying  Agent  for  that  purpose  on  or  before  the  close  of 
 

4 

 
business  on  the  Record  Date.    An  owner  of  Current  Interest  Bonds  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of 
$1,000,000 or more may request in writing to the Paying Agent that such owner be paid interest by wire transfer 
to the bank and account in the United States on file with the Paying Agent as of the Record Date.  The principal, 
and redemption premiums, if any, payable on the Current Interest Bonds shall be payable upon maturity upon 
surrender at the principal office of the Paying Agent.  The principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the 
Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States. 

Each Current Interest Bond authenticated during the period between any subsequent Record Date and 
the close of business on its corresponding Interest Payment Date shall bear interest from such Interest Payment 
Date unless it is authenticated on or before July 15, 2006, in which case it shall bear interest from the Date of 
Delivery.    Any  other  Current  Interest  Bond  shall  bear  interest  from  the  Interest  Payment  Date  immediately 
preceding the date of its authentication.  If, at the time of authentication of any Current Interest Bond interest is 
in default on any outstanding Current Interest Bonds, such Current Interest Bond shall bear interest from the 
Interest  Payment  Date  to  which  interest  has  previously  been  paid  or  made  available  for  payment  on  the 
outstanding  Current  Interest  Bonds.    The  Current  Interest  Bonds  are  issuable  in  denominations  of  $5,000 
principal amount or any integral multiple thereof (except for one Current Interest Bond which may be issued in 
an odd amount).  The Current Interest Bonds mature on August 1, in the years and amounts set forth on the 
cover page hereof. 

Capital  Appreciation  Bonds.    The  Capital  Appreciation  Bonds  are  dated  the  date  of  delivery  of  the 
Bonds.  The Capital Appreciation Bonds are issuable in denominations of $5,000 Maturity Value or any integral 
multiple  thereof,  except  that  one  Capital  Appreciation  Bond  may  be  issued  in  a  denomination  such  that  the 
Maturity Value of such Capital Appreciation Bond shall not be in an integral multiple of $5,000.  The Capital 
Appreciation Bonds are payable only at maturity, according to the amounts set forth in the accreted value tables 
which are based upon the reoffering yield rate of compounding (See “APPENDIX D - Accreted Value Tables” 
herein). 

The Capital Appreciation Bonds shall not bear current interest; each Capital Appreciation Bond shall 
accrete in value daily over the term to its maturity (on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day 
months), from its initial principal (denominational) amount on the date of issuance thereof to its stated Maturity 
Value  thereof,  on  the  basis  of  a  constant  interest  rate  compounded  semiannually  (with  straight-line 
interpolations between Interest Payment Dates).  Accreted value with respect to the Capital Appreciation Bonds, 
shall be compounded semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing August 1, 2006, and 
shall be payable upon the maturity thereof.  The Capital Appreciation Bonds shall mature on the dates and in the 
principal amounts set forth on the cover page hereof. 

See the maturity schedule on the cover page hereof and “DEBT SERVICE SCHEDULE.” 

Book-Entry-Only System 

The information in this section concerning the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) and DTC’s book-
entry-only system has been  provided by DTC for use in securities disclosure documents, and the District takes 
no  responsibility  for  the  completeness  or  accuracy  thereof.    The  District  cannot  and  does  not  give  any 
assurances  that  DTC,  DTC  Participants  or  Indirect  Participants  will  distribute  to  the  Beneficial  Owners 
(a) payments of interest, principal, Maturity Value or premium, if any, with respect to the Bonds, (b) certificates 
representing ownership interest in or other confirmation or ownership interest in the Bonds, or (c) redemption or 
other notices sent to DTC or Cede & Co., its nominee, as the registered owner of the Bonds, or that they will so 
do  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  DTC,  DTC  Participants  or  DTC  Indirect  Participants  will  act  in  the  manner 
described in this Official Statement.  The current “Rules” applicable to DTC are on file with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the current “Procedures” of DTC to be followed in dealing with DTC Participants 
are on file with DTC. 

DTC  will  act  as  securities  depository  for  the  Bonds.    The  Bonds  will  be  issued  as  fully-registered 
securities registered initially in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee), or such other name as 

 

5 

 
may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  One fully-registered certificate for each maturity will 
be issued for the Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. 

DTC  is  a  limited-purpose  trust  company  organized  under  the  New  York  Banking  Law,  a  “banking 
organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a 
“clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, a “clearing agency” 
registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  DTC holds and 
provides asset servicing for over 2 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal 
debt  issues,  and  money  market  instruments  from  over  85  countries  that  DTC’s  participants  (“Direct 
Participants”) deposit with DTC.  DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of 
sales  and  other  securities  transactions  in  deposited  securities,  through  electronic  computerized  book-entry 
transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts.  This eliminates the need for physical movement of 
securities certificates.  Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, 
trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations.  DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
The  Depository  Trust  &  Clearing  Corporation  (“DTCC”).    DTCC,  in  turn,  is  owned  by  a  number  of  Direct 
Participants  of  DTC  and  Members  of  the  National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation,  Government  Securities 
Clearing  Corporation,  MBS  Clearing  Corporation,  and  Emerging  Markets  Clearing  Corporation,  (NSCC, 
GSCC, MBSCC, and EMCC, also subsidiaries of DTC), as well as by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the 
American Stock Exchange, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.  Access to the DTC system 
is also available to others, such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, 
and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either 
directly  or  indirectly  (“Indirect  Participants”).    DTC  has Standard & Poor’s highest rating: AAA.  The DTC 
Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  More information 
about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. 

Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will 
receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records.  The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond 
(“Beneficial  Owner”)  is  in  turn  to  be  recorded  on  the  Direct  and  Indirect  Participants’  records.    Beneficial 
Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase.  Beneficial Owners are, however, 
expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of 
their  holdings,  from  the  Direct  or  Indirect  Participant  through  which  the  Beneficial  Owner  entered  into  the 
transaction.  Transfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books 
of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners.  Beneficial Owners will not receive 
Bonds representing their ownership interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for 
the Bonds is discontinued. 

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in 
the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized 
representative of DTC.  The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or 
such  other  DTC  nominee  effect  no  change  in  beneficial  ownership.    DTC  has  no  knowledge  of  the  actual 
Beneficial  Owners  of  the  Bonds;  DTC’s  records  reflect  only  the  identity  of  the  Direct  Participants  to  whose 
accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners.  The Direct and Indirect 
Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants 
to  Indirect  Participants,  and  by  Direct  Participants  and  Indirect  Participants  to  Beneficial  Owners  will  be 
governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect 
from time to time. 

Redemption notices, if any, shall be sent to DTC.  If less than all of the Bonds within an issue are being 
redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such 
issue to be redeemed. 

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the 
Bonds  unless  authorized  by  a  Direct  Participant  in  accordance  with  DTC’s  Procedures.    Under  its  usual 
 

6 

 
procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the District as soon as possible after the record date.  The Omnibus 
Proxy  assigns  Cede  &  Co.’s  consenting  or  voting  rights  to  those  Direct  Participants  to  whose  accounts  the 
Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). 

Payments of principal and Maturity Value of and interest on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or 
such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  DTC’s practice is to credit 
Direct  Participants’  accounts  upon  DTC’s  receipt  of  funds  and  corresponding  detail  information  from  the 
District on a payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records.  Payments by 
Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the 
case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name”, and will be 
the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC or its nominee, the Paying Agent (as defined herein), the 
District, or the County, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  
Payment of principal to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative 
of  DTC)  is  the responsibility of the County or the Bond  Registrar, disbursement of such payments to Direct 
Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will 
be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. 

DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Bonds at any 
time  by  giving  reasonable  notice  to  the  County  or  the  District,  or  the  County  or  the  District  may  decide  to 
discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC.  Under such circumstances, in the event that 
a successor securities depository is not obtained, the Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered. 

In the event that the book-entry-only system is discontinued, payments of principal and Maturity Value  
of and interest on the Bonds shall be payable as described herein under the caption “THE BONDS - Payment”, 
and transfers will be governed as described herein under the caption “Registration, Transfer and Exchange of 
Bonds.” 

Paying Agent 

U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association, will act as the registrar, transfer agent, 
and paying agent for the Bonds (the “Paying Agent”).  As long as DTC is the registered owner of the Bonds and 
DTC’s book-entry method is used for the Bonds, the Paying Agent will make all payments and send any notice 
of prepayment or other notices to owners only to DTC. 

The Paying Agent, the District, the County and the Underwriter of the Bonds have no responsibility or 
liability for any aspects of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership, or for 
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to beneficial ownership, of interests in the Bonds. 

Optional Redemption 

The Current Interest Bonds maturing before August 1, 2017, are not subject to redemption prior to their 
respective  maturity  dates.    The  Current  Interest  Bonds  maturing  on  or  after  August  1,  2017,  are  subject  to 
redemption prior to their respective stated maturity dates, at the option of the District, from any source of funds, 
as a whole or in part on any date on or after August 1, 2016, a redemption price equal to the principal amount 
thereof to be redeemed, together with interest accrued thereon to the date of redemption, without premium. 

The  Capital  Appreciation  Bonds  are  not  subject  to  optional  redemption  prior  to  their  fixed  maturity 

dates. 

Sinking Fund Redemption 

The  Current  Interest  Bonds  maturing  on  August  1,  2021,  are  subject  to  mandatory  redemption  from 
moneys  in  the  Debt  Service  Fund  prior  to  their  stated  maturity  date,  at  the  principal  amount thereof without 
premium on each August 1, on and after August 1, 2020, in the principal amounts as set forth in the following

Selection of Current Interest Bonds for Redemption 

If less than all of the Current Interest Bonds are called for redemption, the Paying Agent shall select 
Bonds  for  redemption  as  instructed  in  writing  by  the  District  and  if  not  so  instructed,  such  Current  Interest 
Bonds shall be redeemed in whole or in part.  If less than all of the Current Interest Bonds of any given maturity 
are called for redemption, the portions of such Current Interest Bonds within such maturity to be redeemed shall 
be determined by lot.  Redemption by lot shall be in such manner as the Paying Agent shall determine; provided, 
however, that the portion of any Current Interest Bond to be redeemed in part shall be in the principal amount of 
$5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. 

Notice of Redemption 

When  redemption  is  authorized  or  required,  the  Paying  Agent,  upon  written  instruction  from  the 
District, shall give notice (a “Redemption Notice”) of the redemption of the Bonds.  Such Redemption Notice 
shall specify:  (a) the Bonds or designated portions thereof (in the case of redemption of the Bonds in part but 
not in whole) which are to be redeemed, (b) the date of redemption, (c) the place or places where the redemption 
will be made, including the name and address of the Paying Agent, (d) the redemption price, (e) the CUSIP 
numbers (if any) assigned to the Bonds to be redeemed, (f) the bond numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed in 
whole  or  in  part  and,  in  the  case  of  any  Bond  to  be  redeemed  in  part  only,  the  principal  amount  and  stated 
maturity date of each Bond to be redeemed in whole or in part.  Such Redemption Notice shall further state that 
on the specified redemption date there shall become due and payable upon each Bond or portion thereof being 
redeemed at the redemption price thereof, together with the interest accrued or accreted to the redemption date, 
and that from and after such date, interest with respect thereto shall cease to accrue or accrete. 

The Paying Agent shall take the following actions with respect to any such Redemption Notice:  (A) at 
least 30 but not more than 45 days prior to the redemption date, the Redemption Notice shall be given to the 
respective owners of Bonds designated for redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at their addresses 
appearing  on  the  Bond  Register,  (B) at least 30 but not more than 45 days prior to the redemption date, the  
Redemption Notice shall be given by (i) first class mail, postage prepaid; (ii) telephonically confirmed facsimile 
transmission; or (iii) overnight delivery service, to each of the Securities Depositories, and (C) at least 30 but 
not more than 45 days prior to the redemption date, the Redemption Notice shall be given by (i) first class mail, 
postage prepaid; (ii) telephonically confirmed facsimile transmission; or (iii) overnight delivery service, to one 
of the Information Services. 

Neither  failure  to  receive  or  failure  to  give  any  Redemption  Notice  nor  any  defect  in  any  such 
Redemption  Notice  so  given  shall  affect  the  sufficiency  of  the  proceedings  for  the  redemption  of  the  Bonds 
 

8 

 
being redeemed.  Each check issued or other transfer of funds made by the Paying Agent for the purpose of 
redeeming Bonds shall bear or include the CUSIP number identifying, by Bond maturity, the Bonds or being 
redeemed with such check or other transfer. 

Partial Redemption of Bonds.  Upon the surrender of any Bond redeemed in part only, the District shall 
execute and the Paying Agent shall execute and deliver to the owner thereof a new Bond or Bonds of like tenor, 
and  maturity  and  of  authorized  denominations  equal  in  Transfer  Amount  to  the  unredeemed  portion  of  the 
Bonds surrendered.  Such partial redemption shall be valid upon payment of the amount required to be paid to 
such owner, and the District shall be released and discharged thereupon from all liability to the extent of such 
payment. 

Effect of Notice of Redemption.  Notice having been given as aforesaid, and moneys for the redemption 
of the Bonds (including interest accrued thereon to the applicable date of redemption) having been set aside in 
the Debt Service Fund, the Bonds to be redeemed shall become due and payable on such date of redemption. 

If on such redemption date, money for the redemption of all the Bonds to be redeemed including interest 
thereon accrued to such redemption date, shall be held by the Paying Agent so as to be available therefor on 
such redemption date, and if notice of redemption thereof shall have been given as aforesaid, then from and after 
such redemption date, interest with respect to the Bonds to be redeemed shall cease to accrue or accrete and 
become payable.  All money held by or on behalf of the Paying Agent for the redemption of Bonds shall be held 
in trust for the account of the owners of the Bonds so to be redeemed. 

All Bonds paid at maturity or redeemed prior to maturity shall be cancelled upon surrender thereof, and 
shall  be  delivered  to  or  upon  the  order  of  the  District  in  lieu  of  redemption.    All  or  any  portion  of  a  Bond 
purchased by the District shall be cancelled by the Bond Registrar. 

Purchase of Bonds.  In lieu of payment at maturity or redemption at the request of the District, moneys 
in  the  Debt  Service  Fund  may  be  used  and  withdrawn  by  the  Treasurer  at  the  request  of  the  District  and 
transferred to the Paying Agent for the purchase of outstanding Bonds, at public or private sale as and when, and 
at such prices (including brokerage and other charges) as the District may direct, but in no event may Bonds be 
purchased at a price in excess of the principal amount or Maturity Value thereof, plus interest accrued to the date 
of purchase.  All or any portion of any Bond purchased by the Bond Registrar, in lieu of payment at maturity or 
redemption, shall be surrendered to and cancelled by the Paying Agent and delivered to the District. 

Defeasance 

All  or  any  portion  of  the  outstanding  maturities  of  the  Bonds  may  be  defeased  at  any  time  prior  to 

maturity in the following ways:  

(a) 

Cash.  By irrevocably depositing with the County or with an independent escrow agent 
selected  by  the  District  an  amount  of  cash  which together  with  amounts  then on deposit in the Debt 
Service  Fund,  is  sufficient  to  pay  all  Bonds  outstanding  and  designated  for  defeasance,  including  all 
principal and Maturity Value of and interest on and premium, if any, at or before their maturity date; or 

(b) 

United  States  Obligations.    By  irrevocably  depositing  with  the  County  or  with  an 
independent  escrow  agent  selected  by  the  District  noncallable  United  States  Obligations  (as  defined 
below) together with cash, if required, in such amount as will, in the opinion of an independent certified 
public  accountant  together  with  interest  to  accrue  thereon  and  moneys  then  on  deposit  in  the  Debt 
Service Fund together with the interest to accrue thereon, be fully sufficient to pay and discharge all 
Bonds  outstanding  and  designated  for  defeasance  (including  all  principal  and  Maturity  Value  of  and 
interest represented thereby and prepayment premiums, if any), at or before their maturity date; then, 
notwithstanding  that  any  such  maturities  of  Bonds  shall  not  have  been  surrendered  for  payment,  all 
obligations  of  the  District  with  respect  to  all  such  designated  outstanding  Bonds  shall  cease  and 
terminate,  except  only  the  obligation  of  the  County  and  the  Paying  Agent  or  an  independent  escrow 
agent selected by the District to pay or cause to be paid from funds deposited pursuant to paragraphs (a) 

 

9 

 

or (b) above, to the owners of such designated Bonds not so surrendered and paid all sums due with 
respect thereto. 

United States Obligations shall mean direct and general obligations of the United States of America, or 
obligations  that  are  unconditionally  guaranteed  as  to  principal  and  interest  by  the  United  States  of  America, 
including  (in  the  case  of  direct  and  general  obligations  of  the  United  States  of  America)  evidences  of  direct 
ownership of proportionate interests in future interest or principal payments of such obligations.  Investments in 
such  proportionate  interests  must  be  limited  to  circumstances  wherein  (a)  a  bank  or  trust  company  acts  as 
custodian and holds the underlying United States Obligations; (b) the owner of the investment is the real party in 
interest and has the right to proceed directly and individually against the obligor of the underlying United States 
Obligations; and (c) the underlying United States Obligations are held in a special account, segregated from the 
custodian’s  general  assets,  and  are  not  available  to  satisfy  any  claim  of  the  custodian,  any  person  claiming 
through the custodian, or any person to whom the custodian may be obligated; provided that such obligations 
are rated or assessed “AAA” by Standard & Poor’s or “Aaa” by Moody’s Investors Service. 

Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Bonds 

So long as any of the Bonds remains outstanding, the District will cause the Paying Agent to maintain 
and keep at its principal office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of the 
Bonds.  Subject to the provisions below, the person in whose name a Bond is registered on the Bond Register 
shall be regarded as the absolute owner of that Bond.  Payment of or on account of the principal or Maturity 
Value of and premium, if any, and interest on any Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of such owner; 
neither the District, the County nor the Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the 
registration  of  such  Bonds  may  be  changed.    All  such  payments  shall  be  valid  and  effectual  to  satisfy  and 
discharge the District’s liability upon the Bonds, including interest, to the extent of the amount or amounts so 
paid. 

In the event that the book-entry system as described above is no longer used with respect to the Bonds, 

the following provisions will govern the registration, transfer, and exchange of the Bonds. 

Any  bond  may  be  exchanged  for  Bonds  of  like  series,  tenor,  maturity  and  Transfer  Amount  upon 
presentation and surrender at the principal office of the Bond Registrar, together with a request for exchange 
signed by the owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Bond Registrar.  A 
Bond may be transferred on the Bond Register only upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at the principal 
office  of  the  Paying  Agent  together  with  an  assignment  executed  by  the  owner  or  by  a  person  legally 
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Bond Registrar.  Upon exchange or transfer, the Paying Agent 
shall  complete,  authenticate  and  deliver  a  new  Bond  or  Bonds  of  like  series,  tenor  and  of  any  authorized 
denomination or denominations requested by the Owner equal to the Transfer Amount of the Bond surrendered 
and bearing or accruing interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.  Capital Appreciation Bonds 
may not be exchanged for Current Interest Bonds and Current Interest Bonds may not be exchanged for Capital 
Appreciation Bonds. 

If  any  Bond  shall  become  mutilated,  the  District,  at  the  expense  of  the  Owner  of  such  Bond,  shall 
execute,  and  the  Paying  Agent  shall  thereupon  authenticate  and  deliver,  a  new  Bonds  of  like  series,  tenor, 
maturity and Transfer Amount in exchange and substitution for the Bond so mutilated, but only upon surrender 
to the Paying Agent of the Bond so mutilated.  If any Bond shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of such 
loss,  destruction  or  theft  may  be  submitted  to  the  Paying  Agent  and,  if  such  evidence  be  satisfactory  to  the 
Paying Agent and indemnity for the Bond Registrar, the District satisfactory to the Paying Agent shall be given 
by the Owner of such Bond, the District, at the expense of the Bond Owner, shall execute, and the Paying Agent 
shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like series, tenor and maturity and Transfer Amount in 
lieu of and in substitution for the Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen (or if any such Bond shall have matured or 
shall have been called for redemption, instead of issuing a substitute Bond the Paying Agent may pay the same 
without surrender thereof upon receipt of indemnity satisfactory to the Bond Registrar).  The Paying Agent may 
require payment of a reasonable fee for each new Bond delivered and of the expenses which may be incurred by 
the District and the Bond Registrar. 
 

10 

 

If manual signatures on behalf of the District are required in connection with an exchange or transfer, 
the Paying Agent shall undertake the exchange or transfer of Bonds only after the new Bonds are signed by the 
authorized officers of the District.  In all cases of exchanged or transferred Bonds, the District shall execute and 
the Paying Agent shall authenticate and deliver Bonds in accordance with the provisions of the Resolution.  All 
fees and costs of transfer shall be paid by the requesting party.  All Bonds issued upon any exchange or transfer 
shall be valid obligations of the District, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same security and benefit 
under the Resolution as the Bonds surrendered upon that exchange or transfer. 

Any Bond surrendered to the Paying Agent for payment, retirement, exchange, replacement or transfer 
shall  be  cancelled  by  the  Bond  Registrar.    The  District  may  at  any  time  deliver  to  the  Paying  Agent  for 
cancellation  any  previously  authenticated  and  delivered  Bonds  that  the  District  may  have  acquired  in  any 
manner whatsoever, and those Bonds shall be promptly cancelled by the Bond Registrar.  Written reports of the 
surrender and cancellation of Bonds shall be made to the District by the Paying Agent  on or before February 1

Bond Insurance 

MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE 

Concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds, MBIA will issue its Municipal Bond Insurance Policy for 
the  Bonds  (the  “Policy”).    The  Policy  guarantees  the  scheduled  payment  of  principal  of  (or,  in  the  case  of 
Capital Appreciation Bonds, the accreted value) and interest on the Bonds when due as set forth in the form of 
the Policy included as APPENDIX F to this Official Statement. 

MBIA Insurance Corporation 

The  following  information  has  been  furnished  by  MBIA  Insurance  Corporation  (“MBIA”)  for use in 

this Official Statement.  Reference is made to Appendix F for a specimen of MBIA’s policy (the “Policy”). 

MBIA does not accept any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of this Official Statement or 
any information or disclosure contained herein, or omitted herefrom, other than with respect to the accuracy of 
the  information  regarding  the  Policy  and  MBIA  set  forth  under  the  heading  “MUNICIPAL  BOND 
INSURANCE.”    Additionally,  MBIA  makes  no  representation  regarding  the  Bonds  or  the  advisability  of 
investing in the Bonds. 

The  Policy  unconditionally  and  irrevocably  guarantees the  full  and  complete  payment  required  to  be 
made by or on behalf of the District to the Paying Agent or its successor of an amount equal to (i) the principal 
of  (either  at  the  stated  maturity  or  by  an  advancement  of  maturity  pursuant  to  a  mandatory  sinking  fund 
payment) and interest on, the Bonds as such payments shall become due but shall not be so paid (except that in 
the event of any acceleration of the due date of such principal by reason of mandatory or optional redemption or 
acceleration  resulting  from  default  or  otherwise,  other  than  any  advancement  of  maturity  pursuant  to  a 
mandatory sinking fund payment, the payments guaranteed by the MBIA Policy shall be made in such amounts 
and at such times as such payments of principal would have been due had there not been any such acceleration, 
unless  MBIA  elects  in  its  sole  discretion,  to  pay  in  whole  or  in  part  any  principal  due  by  reason  of  such 
acceleration); and (ii) the reimbursement of any such payment which is subsequently recovered from any Owner 
of the Bonds pursuant to a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such payment constitutes an 
avoidable preference to such Owner within the meaning of any applicable bankruptcy law (a “Preference”). 

The Policy does not insure against loss of any prepayment premium which may at any time be payable 
with respect to any Bonds.  The Policy does not, under any circumstances, insure against loss relating to: (i) 
optional or mandatory redemptions (other than mandatory sinking fund redemptions); (ii) any payments to be 
made on an accelerated basis; (iii) payments of the purchase price of Bonds upon tender by an owner thereof; or 
(iv) any Preference relating to (i) through (iii) above.  The Policy also does not insure against nonpayment of 
principal of or interest on the Bonds resulting from the insolvency, negligence or any other act or omission of 
the Paying Agent or any other paying agent for the Bonds. 

Upon  receipt  of  telephonic  or  telegraphic  notice,  such  notice  subsequently  confirmed  in  writing  by 
registered or certified mail, or upon receipt of written notice by registered or certified mail, by MBIA from the 
Paying  Agent  or  any  owner  of  a  Bond  the  payment  of  an  insured  amount  for  which  is  then  due,  that  such 
required payment has not been made, MBIA on the due date of such payment or within one business day after 
receipt of notice of such nonpayment, whichever is later, will make a deposit of funds, in an account with U.S. 
Bank Trust National Association, in New York, New York, or its successor, sufficient for the payment of any 
such insured amounts which are then due.  Upon presentment and surrender of such Bonds or presentment of 
such  other  proof  of  ownership  of  the  Bonds,  together  with  any  appropriate  instruments  of  assignment  to 
evidence  the  assignment  of  the  insured  amounts  due  on  the  Bonds  as  are  paid  by  MBIA  and  appropriate 
instruments to effect the appointment of MBIA as agent for such owners of the Bonds in any legal proceeding 
related to payment of insured amounts on the Bonds, such instruments being in a form satisfactory to U.S. Bank 
Trust National Association, U.S. Bank Trust National Association shall disburse to such owners or the Paying 
Agent payment of the insured amounts due on such Bonds less any amount held by the Paying Agent for the 
payment of such insured amounts and legally available therefor.

amount thereof, shall be deposited to the credit of the Apple Valley Unified School District Building Fund (the

shall  be  deposited  to  the  Building  Fund.    Any  excess  proceeds  of  the  Bonds  not  needed  for  the  authorized 
purposes for which the Bonds are being issued shall be transferred to the Debt Service Fund (as defined) and

the Bonds, there remain excess proceeds, any such excess amounts shall be transferred to the general fund of the 
District. 

 

15 

 
Debt Service Fund 

The accrued interest and any premium received by the County from the sale of the Bonds shall be kept 
separate and apart in the Apple Valley Unified School District General Obligation Bond Debt Service Fund (the 
“Debt Service Fund”) for the Bonds and used only for payment of Accreted Value or Principal of and interest on 
the Bonds. 

Permitted Investments 

Subject to federal tax requirements, amounts on deposit in the funds created under the Resolution shall 
be  invested  by  the  Treasurer-Tax  Collector,  in  consultation  with  the  District,  in  the  Treasurer’s  Pooled 
Investment Fund, any lawful investment permitted by Sections 16429.1 and 53601 of the Government Code of 
the  State  of  California  (the  “Government  Code”),  in  shares  in  a  California  common  law  trust  established 
pursuant to Title 1, Division 7, Chapter 5 of the Government Code, the Local Agency Investment Fund in the 
State  Treasury  of  the  State  of  California  (“LAIF”)  or  in  a  guaranteed  investment  contract  with  a  financial 
institution or insurance company which has at the date of execution thereof one or more of outstanding issues of 
unsecured,  uninsured  and  unguaranteed  debt  obligations  or  a  claims  paying  ability  rated  not  lower  than  the 
second highest rating category (without regard to subcategories) by any agency with a then current rating on the 
Bonds and which satisfies the requirements of the Bond Insurer. 

Investment of Proceeds of Bonds 

In accordance with Education Code Section 41001, school districts in the State maintain substantially all 
operating  funds  in  the  treasuries  of  the  counties  in  which  the  school  districts  are  located.    Each  county  is 
required to invest such funds in accordance with Government Code Section 53601, et seq.  In addition, counties 
have  established  their  own  investment  policies  which  are  generally  intended  to  outline  further  limitations 
beyond those required by the Government Code. 

The  following  information  provides  a  general  description  of  the  County’s  investments,  current  and 

portfolio holdings, and valuation procedures. 

General.  The following information concerning the Treasury Pool of the County of San Bernardino (the 
“Treasury Pool”) has been provided by the Treasurer and has not been confirmed or verified by the District or 
the Underwriter.  No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to 
the absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof, or the information 
contained or incorporated hereby by reference is correct as of any time subsequent to the date hereof, or the 
information contained or incorporated hereby by reference is correct as of any time subsequent as to its date. 

The  County  of  San  Bernardino’s  Investment  Policy  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  State  law.  
This  policy  shall  be  reviewed  annually  by  the  County’s  Treasury Oversight Committee and approved by the 
County  Board  of  Supervisors.    The  purpose  of  this  policy  is  to  establish  cash  management  and  investment 
guidelines  for  the  County  Treasurer,  who  is  responsible  for  the  management  and  investment  of  the  County 
Treasury Pool, which consists of the pooled moneys held on behalf of the County, school districts, community 
college districts and certain special districts within the County. 

This policy shall apply to all investments held within the County Treasury Pool and made on behalf of 
the County and member agencies of the Pool with the exception of certain bond funds for which the Board of 
Supervisors may specifically authorize other allowable investments, consistent with State law.  The Treasurer 
and  Treasurer’s  staff  are  responsible  for  the  full-time,  active  management  of  the  Pool.    All  investments  and 
activities of the Treasurer and staff are made with the understanding that the Treasurer holds a public trust with 
the citizens of the County, which cannot be comprised. 

Fiduciary Responsibility.  The California Government Code, Section 27000.3, declares each treasurer, 
or governing body authorized to make investment decisions on behalf of local agencies, to be a fiduciary subject 
to the prudent investor standard. 
 

16 

 

This standard requires that “When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling or 
managing public funds, the county treasurer or the board of supervisors, as applicable, shall act with care, skill, 
prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing, specifically including, but not limited to, the 
general  economic  conditions  and  the  anticipated  needs  of  the  county  and  other  depositors,  that  a  prudent 
person acting in a like capacity and familiarity with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like 
character and with like aims to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of the county and other 
depositors.  Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments as part of an overall 
investment strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law.”  This standard shall be applied in the 
context of managing the overall portfolio. 

Portfolio  Objectives.   It  is  the  policy  of the Treasurer to invest public funds in a manner which will 
preserve  the  safety  and  liquidity  of  all  investments  within  the  County  investment  pool  while  obtaining  a 
reasonable  return  within  established  investment  guidelines.    The  portfolio  should  be  actively  managed  in  a 
manner that is responsive to the public trust and consistent with State law.  Accordingly, the County investment 
pool will be guided by the following principles, in order of importance: 

The  primary  objective  of  the  Treasurer’s  investment  of  public  funds  is  to  safeguard 

investment principal. 

1. 

2. 

The  secondary  objective  is  to  maintain  sufficient  liquidity  to  insure  that  funds  are 

available to meet daily cash flow requirements. 

3. 

The  third  and  last  consideration  is  to  achieve  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  or  yield 

consistent with these objectives. 

Authority.  The Treasurer’s authority for making investments is delegated by the Board of Supervisors 
in accordance with the California Government Code.  Statutory authority for the investment and safekeeping 
functions are found in Sections 53601 et seq. and 53635 et seq. of the California Government Code. 

Authorized  Investments.    Investments  shall  be  restricted  to  those  authorized  in  the  California 
Government Code and as further restricted by this policy statement, with the exception of certain bond funds in 
which the Board of Supervisors has specifically authorized other allowable investments.  All investments shall 
be further governed by the restrictions shown in Schedule I which defines the type of investments authorized, 
maturity  limitations,  portfolio  diversification  (maximum  percent  of  portfolio),  credit  quality  standards,  and 
purchase restrictions that apply.  Whenever a maximum allowable percentage of the portfolio is stipulated for 
any type of security as detailed above, the limit or maximum allowable, is determined by the portfolio size at the 
close of the date in which the security is purchased. 

In conjunction with these restrictions, County Treasurer staff shall diversify its investments by security 
type, issuer and maturity.  The purpose of this diversification is to reduce portfolio risk by avoiding an over 
concentration in any particular maturity sector, asset class or specific issuer.  As Agency security holdings are 
the  largest  portion  of  the  pool,  diversification  among  the  Agency  issuers  should  be  considered  to  the  extent 
practical when making investments. 

Prohibited Investments.  No investment shall be made that is prohibited by law.  Thus, no investments 
are authorized in inverse floaters, range notes, interest-only strips that are derived from a pool of mortgages, nor 
in any other investment that could result in zero interest if held to maturity. 

Additionally, the following types of investment are also prohibited: 

1. 

Mutual bond funds that do not maintain a constant Net Asset Value (NAV). 

2. 

Illiquid  investments  which  lack  a  readily  available  market  for  trading.    These 
investments are defined to be:  private placement notes or bonds, funding agreements, master notes, and 
loan participations. 

 

17 

 

Staff  Authorized  to  Make  Investments.    Only  the  Treasurer,  Assistant  Treasurer,  Cash  Manager/ 
Investment Officer and Assistant Cash Manager/Investment Officer are authorized to make investments and to 
order the receipt and delivery of investment securities among custodial security clearance accounts. 

Authorized  Broker/Dealers.    The  County  Treasurer  shall  maintain  an  “Eligible  Broker/Dealer  List.”  
Security  transactions  are  limited  solely  to  those  banks,  direct  issuers  and  dealers  included  on  this  list.    All 
financial institutions, whether investment banks, dealers, commercial banks or savings and loan institutions must 
be approved by the County Treasurer before they receive County funds or are able to conduct business with the 
County Treasurer. 

All  firms  with  whom  the  County  does  business  shall  comply  with  the  requirements  set  forth  in 
Schedule IV.  County Treasurer staff shall conduct an annual review of each Broker/Dealer’s current financial 
condition and performance in servicing the County over the prior year. 

Further,  in  compliance  with  Section  27133(c)  &  (d)  of  the  California  Government  Code,  no  dealer 
and/or  securities  firm  shall  be  eligible  if  they  have  made  a  political  contribution  in  excess  of  the  limitations 
contained in Rule G-37 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board or exceeded the limit or honoraria, gifts 
and gratuities set by State law, or by the Fair Political Practices Commission, or by County ordinance. 

Due Diligence.  County Treasurer staff shall conduct a thorough review and perform due diligence of all 
brokers, dealers, issuers of securities and mutual funds prior to investing or conducting transactions with these 
parties and on a continuing basis.  This due diligence shall include a periodic review of recent news, financial 
statements and SEC filings related to each entity. 

Internal  Controls.    The  County  Treasurer  has  established  a  system  of  internal  controls  to  provide 
reasonable assurance that the investment objectives are met and to ensure that the assets of the County Treasury 
Pool are protected from loss, theft or misuse.  The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of 
control  shall  not  exceed  the  benefits  likely  to  be  derived  and that the valuation of costs and benefits require 
estimates and judgments by management.  The County Treasurer shall develop and maintain written procedures 
for  the  operation  of  the  investment  program,  which  are  consistent  with  this  policy.    These  procedures  shall 
include  reference  to  separation  of  duties,  safekeeping,  collateralization,  wire  transfers  and  banking  related 
activities. 

Except for declare emergencies, the County Treasurer’s Office shall observe the following procedures 

on a daily basis: 

1. 

All  investment  transactions  conducted  by  the  County  Treasurer’s  office  shall  be 

documented and reviewed by the Treasurer, and entered daily into the Treasurer’s accounting system. 

2. 
Controller. 

A copy of each day’s investment transactions shall be filed with the County Auditor-

3. 

County  investments  shall  be  transacted,  confirmed,  accounted  for,  and  audited  by 

different people. 

Security  Custody  &  Deliveries.    All  securities  purchased  shall  be  deposited  for  safekeeping  with  the 
custodial bank that has contracted to provide the County Treasurer with custodial security clearance services or 
with  a  tri-party  custodian  bank  under  a  written  tri-party  custody  agreement.    All  security  holdings  shall  be 
reconciled monthly by the County Treasurer and audited at least quarterly by the County Auditor.  These third 
party trust department arrangements provide the County with a perfected interest in, ownership of and control 
over the securities held by the bank custodian on the County’s behalf, and are intended to protect the County 
from the bank’s own creditors in the event of a bank default and filing for bankruptcy.  Securities are not to be 
held in investment firm/broker dealer accounts. 

 

18 

 

All  security  transactions  are  to  be  conducted  on  a  “delivery-versus-payment  basis.”    Confirmation 
receipts  on  all  investments  are  to  be  reviewed  immediately  for  conformity  with  County  transaction 
documentation.  Confirmations resulting from securities purchased under repurchase agreements should clearly 
state  (A)  the  exact  and  complete  nomenclature  of  the  underlying  securities  purchased  and  (B)  that  these 
securities have been sold to the County under a repurchase agreement and (C) the stipulated date and amount of 
the resale by the County back to the seller of the securities. 

Repurchase  Agreements.    Repurchase  agreements  are  restricted  to  primary  dealers  of  the  Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York.  All counterparties must sign a PSA Master Repurchase Agreement and for triparty 
repurchase agreements a Tri-Party Repurchase Agreement as well before engaging in any repurchase agreement 
transactions.  Collateral for repurchase agreements shall have a market value of at least 102% of the amount 
invested and must be marked to market by staff or by an independent third-party or custodial bank acting under 
contract  to  the  County.    Collateral  for  term  repurchase  agreements  should  be  marked  to  market  on  a  regular 
basis.  Repurchase agreements are required to be collateralized by securities authorized under Section 53601 et 
seq. of the California Government Code. 

Competitive  Pricing.    Investment  transactions  are  to  be  made  at  current  market  prices.    Wherever 
possible competitive prices should be obtained through obtaining multiple bids or offers and documenting them 
on the trade ticket or other written forms.  When possible, bids and offers for any investment security shall be 
taken from a minimum of three security dealers/brokers or banks and awards shall be made to the best offer.  
When investments are purchased directly from issuers (e.g. commercial paper and certificates of deposit) market 
prices  may  be  documented  by  reference  to  offerings  of  similar  securities  that  are  of  comparable  rating  and 
maturity by other direct issuers. 

Liquidity.  The portfolio should maintain an effective duration of less than 1.5.  To provide sufficient 
liquidity to meet daily expenditure requirements for the following 12 months, the portfolio should maintain at 
least 40% of its total value in securities having a maturity of 12 months or less. 

Performance Evaluation.  Portfolio performance is monitored daily by the Treasurer and monthly by a 
third party analysis, which includes security pricing and evaluation.  Also, quarterly, a total return measurement 
is performed in the portfolio using the Merrill Lynch G002 6-month Treasury Bill Index as a benchmark. 

Mitigating Market & Credit Risks.  Safety of principal is the primary objective of the portfolio.  Each 
investment transaction shall seek to minimize the County’s exposure to market and credit risks by giving careful 
and ongoing attention to the:  (1) credit quality standards issued by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch’s 
rating services on the credit worthiness of each issuer of securities, (2) limiting the duration of investments of 
the time frames noted in Schedule I, and (3) by maintaining the diversification and liquidity standards expressed 
within this policy. 

In the event of a downgrade of a security held in the portfolio, the Cash Manager/Investment Officer 
shall report the downgrade to the Treasurer promptly.  In the event of a downgrade below the minimum credit 
ratings authorized by this policy, the security shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether 
the security shall be sold or held.  It is preferred to sell such a security if there is no book loss.  In the event of a 
potential loss upon, the Treasurer will evaluate whether to hold or sell the security based on the amount of loss, 
remaining maturity and any other relevant factors. 

Trading  &  Early  Sale Of Securities.  Securities should be purchased with the intent of holding them 
until maturity.  However, in an effort to minimize market risks, credit risks, and increase the total return of the 
portfolio, securities may be sold prior to maturity either at a profit or loss when economic circumstances or a 
deterioration in credit worthiness of the issuer warrant a sale of the securities to either enhance overall portfolio 
yield  or  to  minimize  loss  of  investment  principal.    In  measuring  a  profit  or  loss,  the  sale  proceeds  shall  be 
compared to the original cost of the security plus accrued interest earned and/or any accretion or amortization of 
principal on the security from the date of purchase or the last coupon date, to the date of sale.  However, the sale 
of a security at a loss can only be made with the approval of the County Treasurer or his designee. 

 

19 

 

Purchase Of ‘When Issued’ Securities.  ‘When-issued’ purchases of securities for the express purpose of 
trading these securities prior to cash settlement are considered speculative and are discouraged.  Such trades are 
otherwise authorized as long as sufficient cash is available to consummate their acceptance into the Treasurer’s 
portfolio on the settlement date, and at purchase, there is the ability to hold them in the portfolio to maturity 
without violating any of the diversification/maturity limits of this policy. 

Portfolio Reports/Auditing.  On a monthly basis, the County Treasurer shall prepare and file with the 
Board of Supervisors, the County Administrative Officer, County Auditor-Controller, Superintendent of Schools 
and the County’s Treasury Oversight Committee a report consisting of, but not limited to, the following: 

1. 

All investments detailing each by type, issuer, date of maturity, par value and staging 

the book vs. current market value together with all other portfolio information required by law. 

2. 

Compliance of investments to the existing county Investment Policy. 

3. 

A statement confirming the ability of the Pool to meet anticipated cash requirements for 

the Pool for the next six months. 

In accordance with State law, the County Treasurer shall provide copies of the following documents to 

the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission: 

1. 

Copies of the second and fourth quarter investment reports within sixty (60) days after 

the close of the quarter. 

2. 

Copy of the County Investment Policy no later than sixty (60) days after the close of the 
second quarter of each calendar year and subsequent amendments thereto no later than sixty (60) days 
after the amendment is approved by the Board of Supervisors. 

Treasury  Oversight  Committee.    In  accordance  with  the  California  Government  Code,  the  Board  of 
Supervisors has established a Treasury Oversight Committee.  The Treasury Oversight Committee will render 
unbiased and objective opinions on matters involving the Treasurer’s investment of public funds.  Specifically, 
the law requires that the Treasury Oversight Committee meet to: 

Review  the  Treasurer’s  annual  Investment  Policy  Statement  and  any  subsequent 

changes thereto, prior to its submission to the Board of Supervisors for review and adoption, 

1. 

2. 

Review the Treasurer’s investment portfolio reports and the portfolio’s compliance with 

law and this Investment Policy, 

3. 

Cause an annual audit to be conducted on the Treasurer’s Pooled Investment portfolio. 

The  Treasury  Oversight  Committee  shall  receive  a  copy  of  every  Treasurer’s  Cash  count  Report  as 
prepared by the Internal Audits Section of the County Auditor/Controller’s Office.  Such reports are made in 
accordance  with  the  California  Government  Code  Section  26920  through  26923,  and  County  Board  of 
Supervisor’s resolution dated July 6, 1971, and which includes an evaluation of investments for compliance with 
California Government Code Section 53601. 

All  meetings  of  the  Oversight  Committee  are  to  be  open  to  the  public  and  subject  to  the  Ralph  M. 
Brown Act.  By law, the Treasury Oversight Committee is not allowed to direct individual investment decisions, 
nor select individual investment advisors, brokers, or dealers, or impinge on the day-to-day operations of the 
County Treasury.

CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS 

AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS 

Principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable from the proceeds of an ad valorem tax levied by the 
County for the payment thereof.  (See “THE BONDS - Security” herein.)  Articles XIIIA, XIIIB, XIIIC and XIIID 
of the Constitution, Propositions 98, 111, and 218, and certain other provisions of law discussed below, are 
included in this section to describe the potential effect of these Constitutional and statutory measures on the 
ability of the County to levy taxes and of the District to spend tax proceeds for operating and other purposes, 
and it should not be inferred from the inclusion of such materials that these laws impose any limitation on the 
ability of the County to levy taxes for payment of the Bonds.  The tax levied by the County for payment of the 
Bonds was approved by the District’s voters in compliance with Article XIIIA, Article XIIIC, and all applicable 
laws. 

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution 

On  June  6,  1978,  California  voters  approved  Proposition  13,  which  added  Article  XIIIA  to  the 
California  Constitution  (“Article  XIIIA”).    Article  XIIIA,  as  amended,  limits  the  amount  of  any  ad  valorem 
taxes  on  real  property  to  1%  of  the  “full  cash  value”,  and  provides  that  such  tax  shall  be  collected  by  the 
counties and apportioned according to State law.  Section 1(b) of Article XIIIA provides that the 1% limitation 
does not apply to ad valorem taxes levied to pay interest and redemption charges on (i) indebtedness approved 
by  the  voters  prior  to  July  1,  1978,  or  (ii)  bonded  indebtedness  for  the  acquisition  of  improvement  of  real 
property  approved  on  or  after  July  1,  1978,  by  two-thirds  or  more  of  the  votes  cast  on  the  proposition,  or 
(iii) bonded  indebtedness  incurred  by  a  school  district  or  community  college  district  for  the  construction, 
reconstruction, rehabilitation or replacement of school facilities or the acquisition or lease of real property for 
 

22 

 
school  facilities,  approved  by  55%  or  more  of  the  voters  of  the  district,  but  only  if  certain  accountability 
measures are included in the proposition.  The tax for payment of the Bonds falls within the exception for bonds 
approved by a 55% vote. 

Article XIIIA defines full cash value to mean “the county assessor’s valuation of real property as shown 
on  the  1975-76  tax  bill  under  ‘full  cash  value,’  or  thereafter,  the  appraised  value  of  real  property  when 
purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment.”  This full cash 
value may be increased at a rate not to exceed 2% per year until new construction or a change of ownership 
occurs. 

Pursuant to California law, property owners may apply for a reduction of their property tax assessment 
by filing a written application, in form prescribed by the State Board of Equalization with the appropriate county 
board of equalization or assessment appeals board (the “Appeals Board”).  After the applicant and the assessor 
have presented their arguments, the Appeals Board makes a final decision on the property assessed value.  The 
Appeals Board may rule in the assessor’s favor, in the applicant’s favor, or the Appeals Board may set their own 
opinion  of  the  proper  assessed  value,  which  may  be  more  or  less  than  either  the  assessor’s  opinion  or  the 
applicant’s opinion. 

Any reduction in the assessment ultimately granted applies to the year for which the application is made 
and may also affect the values in subsequent years.  Refunds for taxpayer overpayment of property taxes may 
include refunds for overpayment of taxes in years after that which was appealed.  Current year values may also 
be adjusted as a result of a successful appeal of prior year values.  Any taxpayer payment of property taxes that 
is based on a value that is subsequently adjusted downward will require a refund of overpayment.  

Appeals for reduction in the “base year” value of an assessment, if successful, reduce the assessment for 
the  year  in  which  the  appeal  is  taken  and  prospectively  thereafter.    The  base  year  is  determined  by  the 
completion date of new construction or the date of change of ownership.  Any base year appeal must be made 
within four years of the change of ownership or new construction date. 

Some appeals are based on Section 51 of the Revenue and Taxation Code which requires that for each 
lien date the value of real property shall be the lesser of its base year value annually adjusted by the inflation 
factor pursuant to Article XIIIA of the State Constitution or its full cash value, taking into account reductions in 
value  due  to  damage,  destruction,  depreciation,  obsolescence,  removal  of  property  or  other  factors  causing  a 
decline in value.  During the recession of the 1990’s significant reductions took place in some counties due to 
declining real estate values.  Reductions made under this code section may be initiated by the County Assessor 
or requested by the property owner.  After a roll reduction is granted under this section, the property is reviewed 
on an annual basis to determine its full cash value and the valuation is adjusted accordingly.  This may result in 
further  reductions  or  in  value  increases.    Counties  and  the  State  Board  of  Equalization  have  generally 
determined that such increases must be in accordance with the full cash value of the property and may exceed 
the  maximum  annual  inflationary  growth  rate  allowed  on  other  properties  under  Article  XIIIA  of  the  State 
Constitution.  Once the property has regained its base year value, adjusted for inflation, it once again is subject 
to the maximum annual inflationary factor growth rate allowed under Article XIIIA.   

County of Orange v. Orange County Assessment Appeals Board No. 3.  On April 18, 2003, the Orange 
County Superior Court entered a final judgment in the Bezaire v. County of Orange case (also known as the 
“Prop.  13”  or  “2%  Case”)  holding  that  the  Orange  County  Assessor  (the  “Assessor”)  had  violated  the  2% 
maximum annual inflation adjustment limit of Article XIIIA of the California Constitution when the Assessor 
attempted to compensate for the failure to increase the taxable value of a single family residential property the 
previous year when the market value of the property declined below its taxable value, by increasing the assessed 
value by 4% the following year.  The Assessor established the 4% value increase by attempting to recapture two 
years of inflation adjustments.  The State Board of Equalization had approved this methodology for increasing 
assessed values in similar circumstances, and in 2002, two other local courts (Los Angeles and San Diego) ruled 
differently than Orange County on the same issue, affirming the latter practice. 

 

23 

 

The  Superior  Court  had  ruled  in  favor  of  a  motion  to  restate  the  complaint  as  a  class  action,  whose 
members consisted of those Orange County taxpayers whose property assessments rose more than 2% due to the 
cumulative effect of current assessments with those of previous years.  If upheld on appeal, the class action suit 
could have resulted in the return in excess of $500 million to taxpayers in Orange County.  In June, 2003 the 
Orange County Assessor and the Tax Collector in conjunction with the County of Orange, filed an appeal to the 
Court of Appeal of the State of California, Fourth District, Division Three.  On March 26, 2004, the Court of 
Appeal reversed the lower court, entering judgment in favor of Orange County, finding that the trial court erred 
in ruling that assessments are always limited to no more than 2% of the previous year’s assessment.  The Court 
of Appeal ruled that the base on which the inflation factor is figured remains that of the original purchase price 
(or assessment at time of genuine new construction), not any reduced base resulting from a reassessment in the 
wake of declining property values. 

The  Plaintiffs’  petition  for  review  of  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  decision  was  filed  with  the  California 

Supreme Court on May 6, 2004, but was denied on July 21, 2004.  The decision is now final. 

Allocation of State Funding to Districts 

Under Education Code Section 42238 and following, each school district is determined to have a target 
funding  level:  a  “base  revenue  limit”  per  student  multiplied  by  the  district’s  student  enrollment  measured  in 
units of ADA.  Enrollment can fluctuate due to factors such as district population, competition from private, 
parochial, and public charter schools, inter-district transfers in or out, and other causes.  Losses in enrollment 
will  lower  a  school  districts  base  revenue  limit  (and  may  result  in  loss  of  operating  revenues),  without 
necessarily permitting the district to make adjustments in fixed operating costs. 

The  base  revenue  limit  is  calculated  from  the  district’s  prior-year  funding  level,  as  adjusted  for  a 
number  of  factors  such  as  inflation,  special  or  increased  instructional  needs  and  costs,  and  especially  low 
enrollment.  Generally, the amount of State funding allocated to each school district is the amount needed to 
reach  that  district’s  base  revenue  limit  after  taking  into  account  certain  other  revenues,  in  particular,  locally 
generated property taxes.  This is referred to as State “equalization aid” or colloquially as “backfill.”  To the 
extent local tax revenues increase due to growth in local property assessed valuation, the additional revenue is 
offset by a decline in the State’s contribution. 

A school district’s property tax revenues is comprised of the district’s share of the local 1% property 
tax, received pursuant to Sections 75 and following and Sections 95 and following of the California Revenue 
and Taxation Code.  Education Code Section 42238(h) itemizes the local revenues that are counted towards the 
base  revenue  limit  before  calculating  how  much  the  State  must  provide  in  equalization  aid.    The  more  local 
property  taxes  a  district  receives,  the  less  State  equalization  aid  it  is  entitled  to;  ultimately,  a  school  district 
whose local property tax revenues exceed its base revenue limit is entitled to receive no State equalization aid, 
and  receives  only  its  special  categorical  aid  and  the  “basic  aid”  of  $120  per  student  per  year  guaranteed  by 
Article IX, Section 6 of the State Constitution.  Such districts are known colloquially as “basic aid districts.”  
Districts that receive some equalization aid may be referred to as “revenue limit districts.” 

Legislation Implementing Article XIIIA 

Legislation has been enacted and amended a number of times since 1978 to implement Article XIIIA.  
Under  current  law,  local  agencies  are  no  longer  permitted  to  levy  directly  any  property  tax  (except  to  pay 
voter-approved  indebtedness).    The  1%  property  tax  is  automatically  levied  by  the  County  and  distributed 
according  to  a formula among taxing agencies.  The formula apportions the tax roughly in proportion to the 
relative shares of taxes levied prior to 1979. 

Increases of assessed valuation resulting from reappraisals of property due to new construction, change 
in ownership or from the annual adjustment not to exceed 2% are allocated among the various jurisdictions in 
the “taxing area” based upon their respective “situs.”  Any such allocation made to a local agency continues as 
part of its allocation in future years.

All taxable property is shown at 100% of assessed value on the tax rolls.  Consequently, the tax rate is 
expressed  as  $1  per  $100  of  taxable  value.   All taxable property value included in this Official Statement is 
shown at 100% of taxable value (unless noted differently) and all tax rates reflect the $1 per $100 of taxable 
value. 

Article XIIIB of the California Constitution 

An initiative to amend the California Constitution entitled “Limitation of Government Appropriations,” 
was  approved  on  November  6,  1979,  thereby  adding  Article  XIIIB  to  the  California  Constitution  (“Article 
XIIIB”).  Under Article XIIIB, state and local governmental entities have an annual “appropriations limit” and 
are not permitted to spend certain moneys which are called “appropriations subject to limitation” (consisting of 
tax  revenues,  state  subventions  and  certain  other  funds)  in  an  amount  higher  than  the  appropriations  limit.  
Article  XIIIB  does  not  affect  the  appropriation  of  moneys  which  are  excluded  from  the  definition  of 
“appropriations  subject  to  limitation,”  including  appropriations  for  debt  service  on  indebtedness  existing  or 
authorized  as  of  January  1,  1979,  or  bonded  indebtedness  subsequently  approved  by  the  voters.    In  general 
terms,  the  appropriations  limit  was  originally  to  be  based  on  certain  fiscal  year  1978-79  expenditures,  and 
adjusted annually to reflect changes in consumer prices, populations, and services provided by these entities.  
Among other provisions of Article XIIIB, if these entities’ revenues in any consecutive two-year period exceed 
the amounts permitted to be spent, the excess would have to be returned by revising tax rates or fee schedules 
over  the  subsequent  two  years.    In  the  event  the  District  receives  any  proceeds  of  taxes  in  excess  of  the 
allowable limit in any fiscal year, the District may implement a statutory procedure to concurrently increase the 
District’s appropriations limit and decrease the State’s allowable limit, thus nullifying the need for any return.  
Certain features of Article XIIIB were modified by Proposition 111 in 1990 (see “CONSTITUTIONAL AND 
STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT  REVENUES  AND  APPROPRIATIONS  – 
Proposition 111”). 

Proposition 98 

On November 8, 1988, California voters approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative constitutional 
amendment  and  statute  called  the  “Classroom  Instructional  Improvement  and  Accountability  Act”  (the 
“Accountability  Act”).    Certain  provisions  of  the  Accountability  Act,  have,  however,  been  modified  by 
Proposition  111,  discussed  below,  the  provisions  of  which  became  effective  on  July  1,  1990.    The 
Accountability Act changes State funding of public education below the university level and the operation of the 
State’s  appropriations  limit.    The  Accountability  Act  guarantees  State  funding  for  K-12  school  districts  and 
community college districts (hereinafter referred to collectively as “K-14 school districts”) at a level equal to the 
greater of (a) the same percentage of General Fund revenues as the percentage appropriated to such districts in 
1986-87, or (b) the amount actually appropriated to such districts from the State general fund in the previous 
fiscal  year,  adjusted  for  increases  in  enrollment  and  changes  in  the  cost  of  living.    The  Accountability  Act 
permits the Legislature to suspend this formula for a one-year period.  The current level of guaranteed funding 
pursuant to Proposition 98 is 34.55% of the State general fund. 

The Accountability Act also changes how tax revenues in excess of the State appropriations limit are 
distributed.    Any  excess  State  tax  revenues  up  to  a  specified  amount  would,  instead  of  being  returned  to 
taxpayers, be transferred to K-14 school districts.  Any such transfer to K-14 school districts would be excluded 
from the appropriations limit for K-14 school districts and the K-14 school district appropriations limit for the 
next year would automatically be increased by the amount of such transfer.  These additional moneys would 
enter the base funding calculation for K-14 school districts for subsequent years, creating further pressure on 
other portions of the State budget, particularly if revenues decline in a year following an Article XIIIB surplus.  
The maximum amount of excess tax revenues which could be transferred to K-14 school districts is 4% of the 
minimum State spending for education mandated by the Accountability Act. 

Since the Accountability Act is unclear in some details, there can be no assurances that the Legislature 
or  a  court  might  not  interpret  the  Accountability  Act  to  require  a  different  percentage  of  State  general  fund 
revenues to be allocated to K-14 school districts, or to apply the relevant percentage to the State’s budgets in a 

 

25 

 
different  way  than  is  proposed  in  the  Governor’s  Budget  (see  “DISTRICT  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION  – 
Effect of State Budget on Revenues”). 

Proposition 111 

On  June  5,  1990,  the  voters  of  California  approved  the  “Traffic  Congestion  Relief  and  Spending 
Limitation Act of 1990” (“Proposition 111”), which modified the State Constitution to alter the Article XIIIB 
spending limit and the education funding provisions of Proposition 98.  Proposition 111 took effect on July 1, 
1990. 

The most significant provisions of Proposition 111 are summarized as follows: 

a. 

Annual Adjustments to Spending Limit.  The annual adjustments to the Article XIIIB 
spending limit were liberalized to be more closely linked to the rate of economic growth.  Instead of 
being  tied  to  the  Consumer  Price  Index,  the  “change  in  the  cost  of  living”  is  now  measured  by  the 
change in California per capita personal income.  The definition of “change in population” specifies that 
a portion of the State’s spending limit is to be adjusted to reflect changes in school attendance. 

b. 

Treatment  of  Excess  Tax  Revenues.    “Excess”  tax  revenues  with  respect  to  Article 
XIIIB are now determined based on a two-year cycle, so that the State can avoid having to return to 
taxpayers excess tax revenues in one year if its appropriations in the next fiscal year are under its limit.  
In  addition,  the  Proposition  98  provision  regarding  excess  tax  revenues  was  modified.    After  any 
two-year period, if there are excess State tax revenues, 50% of the excess is to be transferred to K-14 
school  districts  with  the  balance  returned  to  taxpayers;  under  prior  law,  100%  of  excess  State  tax 
revenues  went  to  K-14  school  districts,  but  only  up  to  a  maximum  of  4%  of  the  schools’  minimum 
funding  level.    Also,  reversing  prior  law,  any  excess  State  tax  revenues  transferred  to  K-14  school 
districts  are  not  built  into  the  school  districts’  base  expenditures  for  calculating  their  entitlement  for 
State aid in the next year, and the State’s appropriations limit is not to be increased by this amount. 

c. 

Exclusions  from  Spending  Limit.    Two  new  exceptions  have  been  added  to  the 
calculation of appropriations which are subject to the Article XIIIB spending limit.  First, excluded are 
all appropriations for “qualified capital outlay projects” as defined by the Legislature.  Second, excluded 
are any increases in gasoline taxes above the current nine cents per gallon level, sales and use taxes on 
such increment in gasoline taxes, and increases in receipts from vehicle weight fees above the levels in 
effect on January 1, 1990. 

d. 

Recalculation of Appropriations Limit.  The Article XIIIB appropriations limit for each 
unit  of  government,  including  the  State,  is  to  be  recalculated  beginning  in  fiscal year 1990-91.  It is 
based on the actual limit for fiscal year 1986-87, adjusted forward to 1990-91 as if Proposition 111 had 
been in effect. 

e. 

School Funding Guarantee.  There is a complex adjustment in the formula enacted in 
Proposition 98 which guarantees K-14 school districts a certain amount of State general fund revenues.  
Under prior law, K-14 school districts were guaranteed the greater of (1) a certain percentage  of State 
general  fund  revenues  (the  “first  test”)  or  (2)  the  amount  appropriated  in  the  prior  year  adjusted  for 
changes in the cost of living (measured as in Article XIIIB by reference to per capita personal income) 
and enrollment (the “second test”).  Under Proposition 111, schools will receive the greater of (1) the 
first test, (2) the second test, or (3) a third test, which will replace the second test in any year when 
growth in per capita State general fund revenues from the prior year is less than the annual growth in 
California  per  capita  personal  income.    Under  the  third  test,  schools  will  receive  the  amount 
appropriated  in  the  prior  year  adjusted  for  change  in  enrollment  and  per  capita  State  general  fund 
revenues, plus an additional small adjustment factor.  If the third test is used in any year, the difference 
between the third test and the second test will become a “credit” to schools which will be paid in future 
years when State general fund revenue growth exceeds personal income growth.

Proposition 187 

On November 8, 1994, the voters approved proposition 187, an initiative statute called “Illegal Aliens, 
Ineligibility for Public Services, Verification and Reporting, Initiative Statute” (“Proposition 187”).  Proposition 
187 specifically prohibited public funding of social services, health care services and public school education 
for the benefit of any person not verified as either a United States citizen or a person legally admitted to the 
United  States.    Among  the  provisions  in  Proposition  187  pertaining  to  public  school  education,  the  measure 
required, commencing January 1, 1995, that every school district in the State verify the legal status of every 
child enrolling in the district for the first time.  By January 1, 1996, each school district was further required to 
verify the legal status of children already enrolled in the district and of all parents or guardians of all students.  If 
the district “reasonably suspect(ed)” that a student, parent or guardian was not legally in the United States, that 
district must report the student to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service and certain other 
parties.  The measure also prohibited a school district from providing education to a student it does not verify as 
either a United States Citizen or a personal legally admitted to the United States. 

Following  adoption  of  Proposition  187,  the  Secretary  of  the  United  States  Department  of  Education 
indicated  that  the  reporting  requirement  in  Proposition  187  could  jeopardize  the  ability  of  school  districts  to 
receive  funds  under  the  Family  Educational  Rights  and  Privacy  Act  (“FERPA”),  which  generally  prohibits 
schools  that  receive  federal  funds  from  disclosing  information  in  student  records  without  parental  consent.  
FERPA funds to California school districts total over $2 billion each year. 

Federal  Court  Procedural  Motions:  Preliminary  Injunctions  and  Summary  Judgment. 

  After 
Proposition 187 was adopted, several actions challenging its constitutionality were commenced in federal and 
state  courts  in  California  against  California  Governor  Pete  Wilson,  among  others.    Five  actions  filed  in  the 
United States District Court were consolidated in the United States District Court, Central District of California 
before Judge Marina R. Pfaelzer. 

On  December  14,  1994,  Judge  Pfaelzer  granted  the  plaintiffs’  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction, 
enjoining the implementation and enforcement of section 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 of Proposition 187.  On November 20, 
1995, Judge Pfaelzer granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.  The court 
granted the summary judgment motions with respect to the classification, notification and cooperation/reporting 
provision  for  section  4  through  9  of  proposition  187  on  the  ground  that  these  provisions  created  an 
impermissible  state  scheme  to  regulate  immigration  and  were  therefore  preempted  by  State  law.    The  court 
further held that section 7’s denial of primary and secondary education conflicted with a 1982 United States 
Supreme  Court  Decision  in  Phyler  v.  Doe,  which  held  that  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth 
Amendment prohibits states from excluding undocumented alien children from public schools. 

The court denied plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment with respect to sections 2 and 3 and with 
respect to the benefits denial provisions in section 5, 6 and 8 and on the basis of the defendants’ claim that it 
could promulgate regulations that would bring the procedure for denying benefits into conformity with federal 
law.  Finally, the court further denied the motions for summary judgment with respect to section 8, which denies 
postsecondary education to certain categories of non-citizens. 

The Federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.  On August 22, 
1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 
(the “PRA”), a comprehensive statutory scheme for determining aliens’ eligibility for federal, state and local 
benefits  and  services.    The  PRA  states  that  it  is  the  immigration  policy  of  the  United  States  to  restrict  alien 
access to substantially all public benefits. 

District Court Resolution of Proposition 187 Related Cases.  On August 13, 1998, Judge Pfaelzer ruled 
that the PRA preempts all of Proposition 187 except section 2 (which establishes state criminal penalties for the 
manufacture,  distribution,  or  sale  of  false  documents  to  conceal  the  citizenship  or  resident  alien  status)  and 
section 10 (which details the process for amendment of, and declares the severability of invalid portions of, the 
initiative). 

 

27 

 

Effect  of  Federal  Court  Ruling.    On  April  26, 1999, the former Attorney General of California, Dan 
Lungren, filed an appeal.  On April 26, 1999, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals granted Governor Davis’ 
request for mediation of the Proposition cases.  As a consequence, it cannot be predicted what the ultimate fiscal 
impact of Proposition 187 will be, nor the effect of Proposition 187 on the District or the Bonds. 

Proposition 218 

An  initiative  measure  entitled  “Right  to  Vote  on  Taxes  Act,”  also  known  as  Proposition  218  (the 
“Initiative”),  was  approved  by  California  voters  at  the  November  5,  1996,  statewide  general  election,  and 
became  effective  on  November  6,  1996.    The  Initiative  added  Articles  XIIIC  and  XIIID  to  the  California 
Constitution, and all references herein to Articles XIIIC and XIIID are references to the text as set forth in the 
Initiative. 

Among other things, Article XIIIC establishes that every tax imposed by a local government is either a 
“general tax” (imposed for general governmental purposes) or a “special tax” (imposed for specific purposes), 
and prohibits special purpose government agencies such as school districts from levying general taxes. 

Article  XIIIC  also  provides  that  the  initiative  power  shall  not  be  limited  in  matters  of  reducing  or 
repealing local taxes, assessments, fees and charges.  The initiative power is, however, limited by the United 
States Constitution’s prohibition against state or local laws “impairing the obligation of contracts.”  The Bonds 
represent a contract between the District and the bondholder secured by the collection of ad valorem property 
taxes.  While not free from doubt, it is likely that, once the Bonds are issued, the taxes securing them would not 
be subject to reduction or repeal.  Legislation adopted in 1997 provides that Article XIIIC shall not be construed 
to  mean  that  any  owner  or  beneficial  owner  of  a  municipal  security  assumes  the  risk  of  or  consents  to  any 
initiative measure which would constitute an impairment of contractual rights under the contracts clause of the 
U.S. Constitution. 

Article XIIID deals with assessments and property-related fees and charges.  Article XIIID explicitly 
provides  that  nothing  in  Article  XIIIC  or  XIIID  shall  be  construed  to  affect  existing  laws  relating  to  the 
imposition  of  fees  or  charges  as  a  condition  of  property  development;  however,  it  is  not  clear  whether  the 
initiative  power  is  therefore  unavailable  to  repeal  or  reduce  developer  and  mitigation  fees  imposed  by  the 
District.  No developer fees imposed by the District are pledged or expected to be used to pay the Bonds. 

The interpretation and application of Proposition 218 and the U.S. Constitution’s contracts clause will 
ultimately be determined by the courts with respect to a number of the matters discussed above, and it is not 
possible at this time to predict with certainty the outcome of such determination. 

Future Initiatives 

Article  XIIIA,  Article  XIIIB  and  Propositions  98,  111,  and  218  were  each  adopted  as  measures  that 
qualified for the ballot pursuant to California’s initiative process.  From time to time, other initiative measures 
could be adopted, further affecting District revenues or the District’s ability to expend revenues. 

In connection with the shift of $2.6 billion of local agency revenues to school funding over the next two 
Fiscal  Years,  the  Legislature  and  the  Governor  agreed to place Proposition 1A, entitled “Protection of Local 
Government Revenues,” on the November 2, 2004 ballot (“Proposition 1A”).  Proposition 1A would amend the 
California Constitution to restrict when property tax revenues could be shifted from cities, counties and special 
districts.  In addition to Proposition 1A, an initiative entitled “Local Taxpayers & Public Safety Protection Act” 
has qualified for the November ballot.  The initiative would require statewide voter approval on any bill passed 
by  the  Legislature  adversely  affecting  primary  revenue  streams  to  local  government,  including  property  tax 
revenues.  The District is unable to predict the likelihood of success or failure of these initiatives or what actions 
will be taken in the future by the State Legislature and the Governor to deal with changing State revenues and 
expenditures or the impact such actions will have on State revenues available for education if both initiatives 
pass in November.

Revenue Sources 

The  District  categorizes  its  general  fund  revenues  into  four  sources:  (1)  revenue  limit  sources 
(consisting of a mix of State and local revenues), (2) federal revenues, (3) other State revenues and (4) other 
local revenues.  Each of these revenue sources is described below. 

Revenue  Limit  Sources.    Since  fiscal  year  1973-74,  California  school  districts  have  operated  under 
general purpose revenue limits established by the State Legislature.  In general, revenue limits are calculated for 
each school district by multiplying the A.D.A. for such district by a base revenue limit per unit of A.D.A.  The 
revenue limit calculations are adjusted annually in accordance with a number of factors designated primarily to 
provide cost of living increases and to equalize revenues among all California school districts of the same type.  
In  fiscal  year  2003-04,  the  District’s  lease  revenue  limit  per  unit  of  ADA  was  $4,899.23,  and  $5,014.77  for 
fiscal year 2004-05.  For fiscal year 2005-06, the District estimates that its income limit per unit of ADA will be 
$5,225.77. 

Revenue limit sources accounted for 68% of the total District revenues in fiscal year 2000-01, 69% in 
fiscal year 2001-02, 74.5% in fiscal year 2002-03, 72% in fiscal year 2003-04, 73.9% in year 2004-05, and are 
projected to account for 74.3% of such revenues for fiscal year 2005-06.  Funding of the District’s revenue limit 
is accomplished by a mix of (1) local property taxes, and (2) State apportionments of basis and equalization aid.  
The District’s fiscal year 2001-02 share of the property tax revenue in the County was approximately $12.75 
million  or  27.5%  of  the  District’s  General  Fund  revenue,  was  approximately  $14.4  million  or  17.2%  of  the 
District’s General Fund revenue for fiscal year 2002-03, approximately $14.7 million or 17.1% of the District’s 
General Fund revenue for fiscal year 2003-04, approximately $11.1 million or 12.0% of the District’s General 
Fund  for  fiscal  year  2004-05  and  is  projected  to  be  $10.2  million  or  10.4%  of  the  District’s  General  Fund 
revenue  for  fiscal  year  2005-06.    See  “-  Ad  Valorem  Taxes”  below.    Generally,  the  State’s  apportionments 
amount to the difference between the District’s revenue limits and its local property tax revenues.  The principal 
apportionment was 53.7% of the District’s General Fund revenue for fiscal year 2000-01, 54.7% for fiscal year 
2001-02, 55.2% for fiscal year 2002-03, 53.6% for fiscal year 2003-04, 60.5% for fiscal year 2004-05, and are 
projected to be 63.4% for fiscal year 2005-06. 

Funding of the District’s revenue limit is provided by a mix of local property taxes and State apportionments of 
basic  and  equalization  aid.    Generally,  the  State  apportionments  will  amount  to  the  difference  between  the 
District’s revenue limit and its local property tax revenues. 

Beginning in 1978-79, Proposition 13 and its implementing legislation provided for each county to levy 
(except for levies to support prior voter-approved indebtedness) and collect all property taxes, and prescribed 
how levies on county-wide property values are to be shared with local taxing entities within each county. 

Federal  Sources.    The  federal  government  provides  funding  for  several  District  programs,  including 
special  education  programs,  programs  under  the  Educational  Consolidation  and  Improvement  Act,  and 
specialized programs such as Drug Free Schools.  The federal revenues, most of which are restricted, comprised 
approximately 6.1% of General Fund sources in fiscal year 2000-01 and approximately 6.2% of such revenues 
for  fiscal  year  2001-02,  were  approximately  7.27%  of  such  sources  for  fiscal  year  2002-03,  10.4%  of  such 
sources for fiscal year 2003-04, 9.2% of such sources for Fiscal Year 2004-05 and are projected to comprise 
approximately 8.7% of such sources for fiscal year 2005-06. 

Other  State  Revenues.    As  discussed  above,  the  District  receives  State  apportionment  of  basic  and 
equalization aid in an amount equal to the difference between the District’s revenue limit and its property tax 
revenues.  In addition to such apportionment revenue, the District receives substantial other State revenues (the 
“Other State Sources”). 

These Other State Sources are primarily restricted revenues funding items such as the Special Education 
Master  Plan,  Economic  Impact  Aid,  School  Improvement  Program,  Class  Size  Reduction  Program, 
home-to-school transportation, instructional materials, and mentor teachers.  Other State Sources accounted for 
approximately 19% of General Fund sources in fiscal year 2000-01 and 16.9% of such sources in fiscal year 
 

29 

 
2001-02, were approximately 12.5% of such sources for fiscal year 2002-03, were 11.1% of such sources for 
fiscal  year  2003-04,  were  approximately  12%  for  Fiscal  Year  2004-05  and  are  projected  to  comprise 
approximately 11% of such sources in fiscal years 2005-06.  These Other State Sources are primarily restricted 
revenues,  which  fund  items  such  as  the  Special  Education  Master  Plan,  home  to  school  transportation, 
instructional materials and mentor teachers. 

The District receives State aid from the California State Lottery (the “Lottery”) which was established 
by a constitutional amendment approved at the November 1984 general election.  Lottery revenues must be used 
for the education of students and cannot be used for non-instructional purposes such as real property acquisition, 
facility  construction  or  the  financing  of  research.    Lottery  revenues  estimated  to  have  been  received  by  the 
District for the General Fund were approximately $1.781 million for fiscal year 2000-01 which amounted to 
approximately 1.95% of the total General Fund sources, approximately $1.64 million for fiscal year 2001-02 
which amounted to approximately 1.9% of the total General Fund sources, were $1.76 million for fiscal year 
2002-03 which amounted to approximately 2.2% of the total General Fund sources, were $1.7 million for fiscal 
year 2003-04 which amounted to approximately 1.9% of the General Fund revenues, were $1.9 million for fiscal 
year 2004-05 which amounted to approximately 2.1% of the total General Fund sources, and are projected to be 
approximately  $1.4  million  for  fiscal  year  2005-06,  which  will  amount  to  1.8%  of  the  total  General  Fund 
sources.  Lottery revenues must be used for the education of students and cannot be used for non-instructional 
purposes such as real property acquisition, facility construction, or the financing of research. 

Other  Local  Revenues.    In  addition  to  property  taxes,  the  District  receives  additional  local  revenues 
from  sources  (the  “Other  Local  Sources”)  such  as  investment  earnings.    Revenues  from  these  Other  Local 
Sources were approximately $5.36 million for fiscal year 2000-01 which amounted to approximately 6.65% of 
the  total  General  Fund  sources  and  approximately  $5.93  million  for  fiscal  year  2000-01  which  amounted  to 
approximately 7% of the total General Fund sources, were approximately $6.02 million for fiscal year 2002-03 
which will amount to approximately 6.9% of the total General Fund sources, were $6.02 million for fiscal year 
2003-04  which  will  amount  to  6.9%  of  the  total  General  Fund  sources  were  $4.5  million  for  the  fiscal  year 
2004-05  which  amounted  to  4.8%  of  the  total  General  Fund  sources  and  are  projected  to  be  approximately 
$5.3 million for fiscal year 2005-06 which will amount to 5.4% of the total General Fund sources. 

State Funding of Education 

Most  California  school  districts,  including  the  District,  receive  a  significant  portion  of  their  funding 
from State appropriations.  As a result, revenues received by the District may be affected by changes in State 
revenues and corresponding appropriations made by the Legislature to school districts. 

Annual State apportionments of basic and equalization aid to school districts are computed based on a 
revenue limit per unit of average daily attendance (“A.D.A.”).  Prior to fiscal year 1998-99, daily attendance 
numbers included students who were absent from school for an excused absence, such as illness.  Effective in 
fiscal year 1998-99, only actual attendance is counted in the calculation of A.D.A.  This change is essentially 
fiscally  neutral  for  school districts which maintain the same excused absence rate.  The rate per student was 
recalculated to provide the same total funding to school districts in the base year as would have been received 
under the old system.  In the future, school districts which can improve their actual attendance rate will receive 
additional funding. 

The  following  table  shows  the  District’s  A.D.A.  and  the  deficit  revenue  limit  per  A.D.A.  for  recent 

30 

years:

Effect of State Budget on Revenues 

General.  Most public school districts in California are dependent on revenues from the State for a large 
portion of their operating budgets.  California school districts receive an average of about 55% of their operating 
revenues from various State sources.  The primary source of funding for school districts is the revenue limit, 
which is a combination of State funds and local property taxes (see “DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION  
State Funding of Education” herein).  State funds typically make up the majority of a district’s revenue limit.  
School districts also receive substantial funding from the State for various categorical programs.  General fund 
revenues received by the District from all State sources accounted for approximately 72.8% of total general fund 
revenues  in  2000-01,  were  71.6%  of  such  revenues  in  fiscal  year  2001-02,  were  projected  to  account  for 
approximately 87.3% in fiscal year 2001-02, were 82.7% in fiscal year 2003-04, were approximately 85.8% in 
fiscal year 2004-05, and are projected to account for approximately 85.8% in fiscal year 2005-06. 

The availability of State funds for public education is a function of constitutional provisions affecting 
school district revenues and expenditures (see “DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION – Constitutional and 
Statutory Limitations on Revenues and Expenditures”), the condition of the State economy (which affects total 
revenue available to the State general fund), and the annual State budget process. 

California Teachers’ Association v. Gould.  During several years in the early 1990s, the State realized 
less tax receipts than it had previously budgeted, so that in each of those years public education received more in 
funding than its minimum entitlement under Proposition 98.  (See “CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY 
PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS - Proposition 98.)  The State 
legislature characterized the overfunded amounts as “loans” to be repaid from the Proposition 98 entitlement in 
future  years.    The  aggregate  amount  of  these  loans  is  approximately  $1.76  billion.    The  validity  of  the  loan 
characterization and repayment mechanism were challenged by the California Teachers’ Association (“CTA”), 
which sought to void the obligation to repay the loan amounts. 

On April 26, 1994, a Sacramento County superior court entered a judgment that K-14 districts are not 
obligated to repay the inter-year loans.  The decision was appealed by the State, and pending such appeal the 
CTA  and  the  State  reached  a  settlement  which  became  final  on  April  12,  1996.    Pursuant  to  the  settlement 
agreement, no new inter-year loans will be created; the existing loans are required to be repaid over an eight-
year  period,  with  K-14  schools  contributing  $825  million  from  funds  allocated  to  education  under 
Proposition 98,  and  the  State  contributing  the  balance  of  $938  million.    The  schools’  contribution  of  $825 
million will be counted toward the Proposition 98 guarantee in future years. 

California State Budget for Education.  The Governor is required by the State Constitution to propose a 
budget to the State Legislature no later than January 10 of each year, and a final budget must be adopted by a 
2/3 vote of each house of the Legislature no later than June 15, although this deadline is routinely breached.  
The  budget  becomes  law  upon  the  signature  of  the Governor, who retains veto power over specific items of 
expenditure.    State  income  tax,  sales  tax,  and  other  receipts  can  fluctuate  significantly  from  year  to  year 
 

31 

 
depending  on  economic  conditions  in  the  State  and  nation.    Because  funding  for  K-12  education  is  closely 
related to overall State income, funding levels can also vary significantly from year to year, even in the absence 
of  significant  education  policy  changes.    The  District  cannot  predict  how  State  income  or  State  education 
funding  will  vary  over  the  entire  term  to  maturity  of  the  Bonds,  and  the  District  takes  no  responsibility  for 
informing owners of the Bonds as to any such annual fluctuations.  Information about the State budget and State 
spending for education is regularly available at various State-maintained websites.  Text of the budget may be 
found at the website of the Department of Finance, www.dof.ca.gov, under the heading “California Budget.”  
An impartial analysis of the budget is posted by the Office of the Legislative Analyst at www.lao.ca.gov.  In 
addition, various State of California official statements, many of which contain a summary of the current and 
past State budgets and the impact of those budgets on school districts in the State, may be found at the website 
of the State Treasurer, www.treasurer.ca.gov.  The State has not entered into any contractual commitment with 
the District, the County, the Underwriter or the owners of the Bonds to provide State budget information to the 
District or the owners of the Bonds.  Although the State sources of information listed above are believed to be 
reliable,  the  District  and  the  underwriter  assume  no  responsibility  for  the  accuracy  of  the  state  budget 
information set forth or referred to therein. 

Expenditure Reduction For 2001/02 and 2002/03 State Budgets.  In response to lower State revenues 
during  2001/02  than  had  been  estimated  in  the  2001/02  State  Budget,  on  November  14,  2001,  the  Governor 
announced a proposal for reducing expenditures in the 2001/02 State Budget by approximately $2.25 billion, 
including  $843.5  million  of  funding  for  various  programs  affecting  K-12  school  districts.    The  resulting 
reductions  in  the  2001/02  State  Budget  affected  programs  already  appropriated  in  the  2001/02  State  Budget.  
Some  of  the  Governor’s  proposals  were  enacted  by  a  special  session  of  the  State  Legislature  convened  in 
January 2002. 

The  Governor’s  expenditure  reductions  for  the  2001/02  State  Budget  did  not  affect  revenue  limit 
apportionments  to  K-12  school  districts,  but  resulted  in  reduced  revenues  for  various  special  programs.  
Examples of K-12 school programs the Governor reduced include one-time block grants to offset higher energy 
costs,  block  grants  for  low-performing  schools,  performance  incentives  and  teacher  training  awards.    The 
District incorporated these changes to the 2001/02 operating budget, resulting in a reduction in expenditures.  
The 2002/03 State Budget was signed by the Governor on September 5, 2002, after the statutory deadline for 
adoption  of  the  State  Budget.    The  2002/03  State  budget  proposed  total  2002/03  Proposition  98  funding  of 
approximately $43.9 billion, of which the General Fund share was approximately $28.9 billion.  The foregoing 
takes into account the Governor’s proposed mid-year (2002/03) cuts of $1.9 billion in December, 2002 for K-14 
(including community colleges) education revisions which were made in response to a projected $34.8 billion 
general fund budget shortfall. 

2003/04 State Budget.  Governor Davis introduced the proposed 2003/04 State Budget on January 10, 
2003,  which  addressed  California’s  projected  $34.8  billion  general  fund  budget  shortfall.    The  total  2003/04 
Proposition 98 funding proposed by the Governor was approximately $44.1 billion, a slight increase over the 
revised 2002/03 funding level.  However, the proposed 2003/04 State Budge reflects a $1.5 billion across-the-
board reduction in funding for K-12 education, $438 million in one-time fund shifts in proposition 98 funds, and 
$343 million in specific program cuts.  These reductions are in addition to the mid-year (2002/03) cut proposed 
by  the  Governor  in  December,  2002  for  K-14  (including  community  colleges)  education.    The  Governor’s 
2003/04 budget proposes additional mid-year cuts of $803.9 million for K-14 education.  On May 14, 2003, the 
Governor presented the May Revision to the Governor’s Budget.  The May Revision maintained education as a 
high  priority  and  provides  more  funding  than  was  contemplated  in  the  original  Governor’s  Budget.    The 
proposed  2003/04  State  Budget  was  revised  by  the  Legislature  and  the  Governor  prior  to  final  approval  on 
August 2, 2003. 

Recall Election.  On November 7, 2003, a recall election was held at which the electorate approved the 
recall  of  Governor  Davis.    Governor  Schwarzenegger  was  elected  for  the  remaining  term  of  the  Governor’s 
office (though 2006).  One of Governor Schwarzenegger’s first acts was the repeal of an increase in the vehicle 
license fee that had been implemented as part of the 2003/04 budget process to provide approximately $4 billion 
in  revenues  to  the  State.    The  District  cannot  predict  and  will  have  no  control  over  the  outcome  of  any

reductions to the 2003/04 State Budget affecting the funding of K-12 school districts that may be effectuated by 
Governor Schwarzenegger. 

March,  2004  Election  and  Economic  Recovery  Bond  Sale.    Two  measures  intended  to  address  the 
existing cumulative budget deficit and to implement structural reform were both approved at the March 2, 2004, 
statewide primary election.  The Balanced Budget Amendment (Proposition 58), requires the State to adopt and 
maintain  a  balanced  budget  and  establish  an  additional  reserve,  and  restricts  future  long-term  deficit-related 
borrowing.  The second measure, The California Economic Recovery Bond Act (Proposition 57), authorizes the 
issuance  of  up  to  $15  billion  of  economic  recovery  bonds  (the  “Economic  Recovery  Bonds”)  to  finance  the 
negative  State  general  fund  reserve  balance  as  of  June  30,  2004,  and  other  State  general  fund  obligations 
undertaken prior to June 30, 2004.  The Economic Recovery Bonds are being issued in lieu of “fiscal recovery 
bonds”  previously  authorized  by  the  California  Fiscal  Recovery  Financing  Act  (Government  Code 
Section 99000 et. seq.).  The Economic Recovery Bonds are secured by a pledge of revenues from an increase in 
the state’s share of the sales and use tax of one-quarter cent beginning July 1, 2004.  The share of the tax going 
to local governments will be reduced by the same amount and, in exchange, local governments will receive an 
increased share of the local property tax (and K-14 districts a reduced share) during the time the one-quarter cent 
is being used to pay off the bonds (estimated to be between 9 and 14 years).  This shift in revenues between the 
state  and  local  governments  is  known  as  the  “triple  flip.”    On  May  5,  2004,  the  State  sold  $7.9  billion  of 
Economic Recovery Bonds.  See “ – Fiscal Year 2003/04 Budget “ and “ – Fiscal Year 2004/05 Budget” below. 

Fiscal Year 2005/06 Budget 

On  January  12,  2005,  the  Governor  submitted  a  proposal  for  the  fiscal  year  2005-06  budget  which 
involves significant reductions in certain K-12 education funding due to both a large budget shortfall in 2005-06 
and ongoing structural imbalances between revenue and expenditures.  The budget proposes total state spending 
in fiscal year 2005-06 of $109 billion (excluding expenditures of federal funds and bond funds).  This represents 
an  increase  of  4.4  percent  from  the  current  year.  General  Fund  spending  is  projected  to  increase  from  $82.3 
billion to $85.7 billion.   

The  Governor’s  budget  proposes  $2.5  billion  in  new  K-12  expenditures,  representing  a  6.0  percent 

increase in funding.   

COLA – The budget provides for $1,650 million for a 3.93 percent COLA ($1,222 million for revenue 
limits and $428 million for categorical programs), and $395 million for 0.79 percent growth in student 
attendance ($246 million for revenue limits and $149 million for categorical programs).  

Deficit  Factor  Reduction  –  The  state  previously  reduced  revenue  limits  by  $894  million  by  not 
providing a COLA (1.8 percent) for fiscal year 2003-04 and reducing revenue limits by 1.2 percent from 
2002-03 level.  The 2004-05 Budget Act provided $270 million to restore part of these reductions.  The 
fiscal year 2005-06 budget proposal would provide an additional $329 million for this purpose.  

Williams  Settlement  –  The  budget  proposes  that  $100  million  in  one-time  funds  be  set  aside  for 
emergency facility repairs.  

The  Governor’s  budget  also  proposes  certain  savings  which  result  in  reduced  funding  for  K-12 

education. 

Proposition 98 – The budget proposes to hold Proposition 98 spending approximately at the fiscal year 
2004-05 level.  The total proposed budget for Proposition 98 allocation includes a total of $50 billion in 
2005-06, an increase of 6.1 percent over the current year’s estimate.  The suspension in Proposition 98 
allocation results in $1.2 billion in savings for the state.  For K-12 education, this results in a $2 billion 
reduction in funding than would have otherwise be required absent the suspension. 

STRS  –  The  budget  proposal  includes  the  termination  of  state  funding  of  an  annual  base  program 
contribution for the State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS).   

 

33 

 

Other major budget and policy initiatives include: 

Merit Based Teacher Compensation – This proposal would switch teacher pay from the current “step 
and  column”  system,  which  is  based  on  seniority  and  higher  education  units,  to  a  merit-based  pay 
system. 

Teacher Professional Development Block Grant – The budget proposes to consolidate $362 million 
in categorical programs for professional development and teacher credentialing into one block grant. 

Charter School Block Grant Reform – The budget proposal would create a new  categorical program 
for charter schools that provides for supplemental funding. 

School-Site Budgeting Pilot – Under this proposal would create a program which would place control 
of school resources at each school site to encourage active participation of parents and teacher in local 
decision making. 

State Management of Failing Schools – Under this proposal, the State Board of Education would be 
authorized  to  assign  “leadership  teams”  to  manage  schools  that  have  failed  to  meet  accountability 
standards set forth in California state law and the federal No Child Left Behind Act. 

Fiscal Year 2005/06 Budget May Revision 

The  May  Revision  to  the  Governor’s  2005/06  Budget  (the  “May  Revision”)  projects  $4.2  billion  in 
added  revenues  to  the  State  based  on  improved  economic  activity  and  higher  than  expected  net  gains  from 
amnesty  programs  for  those  State  residents  who  owe  back  taxes.    The  May  Revision  proposes  that  such 
additional revenues be used to eliminate new borrowing proposed in the January budget.   

In  addition  the  Governor’s  May  Revision  proposed  certain  increases  and  decreases  to  the  K-12 

education budget. 

Proposition 98 – The May Revision reduces Proposition 98 funding for the 2004/05 fiscal year to $142 
million due to property tax and student attendance adjustments.  Although there is a decrease in the total 
amount  apportioned  for  fiscal  year  2004/05,  due  to  the  decline  in  student  attendance,  the  per  pupil 
funding  has  increased  by  $28.    Proposition  98  funding  for  the  2005/06  fiscal  year  remains  the  same 
under the May Revision.  In addition, the May Revision proposes a one-time settlement of funds in the 
amount of $252 million for various K-12 educational programs.   

COLA Adjustment – An additional $14 million is provided for growth and COLA.  The additional 
funds are generated by lowered costs for PERS and unemployment insurance. 

Fiscal Year 2005/06 Adopted Budget 

The  State  legislature  adopted  the  final  2005-06  budget  (the  “Final  Budget”)  on  July  7,  2005.    The 
Governor signed the 2005 Budget Act on July 11, 2005.  Significant changes between the Final Budget and the 
May revisions include an appropriation of $31 million for a statutorily required payment to the State Teachers 
Retirement  System  (“STRS”),  eliminates  the  Governor’s  proposal  to  shift  $469  million  in  teacher  retirement 
costs from the State General Fund to local school districts, and eliminated the Governor’s proposed child care 
reforms which modified liability requirements for the working poor. 

Fiscal Year 2006/07 Budget 

Governor  Schwarzenegger  announced  his  proposed  fiscal  year  2006-07  State  Budget  (the  “Proposed 
2006-07 Budget”) on January 10, 2006, which includes an estimated $97.9 billion general fund spending plan 
and  addresses  an  estimated  operating  deficit  in  fiscal  year  2006-07  of  approximately  $6.4  billion.    After 
adjusting  for  prepayments  and  repayments  of  prior  obligations,  the  fiscal  year  2006-07  operating  deficit  is 
 

34 

 
approximately $4.7 billion.  Key economic indicators such as declining unemployment rates and the growth of 
personal income have assisted in the State’s economic recovery.  The Proposed 2006-07 Budget includes the 
following  items:  a  deferment  of  tax  increases;  a  determination  not  to  issue  the  remaining  $3.7  billion  of 
Proposition  57  Economic  Recovery  Bonds;  a  deposit  of  approximately  $920  million  into  the  Budget 
Stabilization Account approved by voters in 2004 under Proposition 58 (approximately $460 million of which is 
dedicated  to  the  early  retirement  of  the  Proposition  57  Economic  Recovery  Bonds);  applying  approximately 
$920 million of one-time revenues to pay down past loans from Proposition 42 earlier than required by law; and 
repaying approximately $149 million in prior loans from 12 separate special funds. 

The Governor also proposed a comprehensive rebuilding of the State’s infrastructure system, including 
roads and highways, schools and colleges, public safety as well as water supply and levee systems with a 20-
year plan, encompassing $222 billion in infrastructure investments, of which $68 billion will be financed with 
general obligation bonds to be placed on the ballot for approval by California voters over a series of elections 
between 2006 and 2014.  The Governor proposes that the Legislature approve the first phase, a ten-year plan, as 
a single package. 

The Proposed 2006-07 Budget assumes General Fund Revenues of $98.6 billion (including prior year 
resources  of  $7.03  billion),  expenditures  of  $97.9  billion  and  a  year-end  reserve  of  $613  million  (after 
distributions to the Reserve for Liquidation of Encumbrances, the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties and 
the Budget Stabilization Account). 

With regard to K-12 school districts, total per-pupil expenditures from all sources are projected by the 
Governor to be $10,336 in fiscal year 2005-06 and $10,996 in fiscal year 2006-07, including funds provided for 
prior  year  settle-up  obligations.    Total  fiscal  year  2006-07  Proposition  98  support  for  K-12  education  will 
increase  by  8.7  percent  over  the  revised  2005  Budget  Act  level,  as  adjusted  for  changes  in  local  revenues, 
average  daily  attendance  (“ADA”)  and  forecasted  economic  factors.    K-12  Proposition  98  per-pupil 
expenditures in the Proposed 2006-07 Budget are $8,052 in fiscal year 2006-07, up from $7,428 in fiscal year 
2005-06 (including funds provided for prior year settle-up obligations). 

The proposed 2006-07 Budget includes an increase of $2.3 billion to fully fund increases in growth and 
cost-of-living  adjustments  (“COLAs”)  for  K-12  revenue  limits  (general  purpose  funding  for  schools)  and 
categorical programs, as well as $200 million to repay most of the outstanding school district deficit factor owed 
as  a  result  of  reductions  to  school  revenue  limits  made  in  prior  years.    The  Proposed  2006-07  Budget  also 
includes $200 million to equalize the revenue limits of school districts.  Taken together, the COLA and growth 
adjustments to revenue limit funding, equalization funding and deficit reduction funding would total in excess of 
$2.7 billion. 

•  Proposition 98 – Total fiscal year 2004-05 Proposition 98 funding was $47 billion, of which 
the General Fund share was $34 billion.  Total fiscal year 2005-06 Proposition 98 funding is 
now estimated to be $50 billion, which reflects a 6.3 percent increase over fiscal year 2004-05.  
The General Fund share is $36.3 billion in fiscal year 2005-06.  These funding levels have been 
adjusted  for  changes  in  attendance  and  costs  for  apportionment  programs.    Total  fiscal  year 
2006-07  Proposition  98  funding  is  proposed  at  $54.3  billion,  which  reflects  an  8.7  percent 
increase over the revised estimate for fiscal year 2005-06.  This level of funding also reflects 
$1.7 billion in Proposition 98 spending above the level that otherwise would have been required 
by  the  Proposition  98  guarantee  for  fiscal  year  2006-07.    The  $54.3  billion  Proposition  98 
funding  level  for  fiscal  year  2006-07  also  includes  an  increase  of  $428  million  reflecting 
implementation  of  Proposition  49.    Beginning  in  fiscal  year  2006-07,  Proposition  49  will 
increase state funding for the After-School Education and Safety Program to $550 million per 
year.  The General Fund provides approximately 74 percent, or $40.5 billion of total proposed 
Proposition 98 funding.  These totals include funding for K-12 and community colleges. 

•  Proposition  98  Reversion  Account  –  The  Proposed  2006-07  Budget  includes  a  one-time 
Proposition  98  Reversion  Account  funding  totaling  $213.2  million  to  be  appropriated  as 
follows:  $106.6  million  for  school  facility  emergency  repairs,  consistent  with  the  Williams 

 

35 

 

 

agreement, $63.7 million for CalWORKS State 3 Child Care, $18.7 million for mandates, $9.6 
million for teacher credentialing, $9 million for charter school facilities, $3 million for teacher 
recruitment, $1.1 million for school business officer training, $500,000 for coaches training and 
approximately $39,000 for attendance accounting. 

•  Fiscal  Year  2006-07  Apportionment  Adjustments  –  For  fiscal  year  2005-06,  the  Proposed 
2006-07 Budget reflects a decrease of $252 million General Fund for revised estimates related 
to school district and county office of education revenue limit apportionments.  This adjustment 
is due primarily to an increase in local revenue estimates of $280 million, offset by an increase 
in  costs  associated  with  declining  enrollment  funding.    The  Proposed  2006-07  Budget 
substantially  increases  general-purpose  funding  for  schools  by  fully funding statutory growth 
and  COLA.    Furthermore,  the  Proposed  2006-07  Budget  provides  $200  million  for  school 
district  revenue  limit  equalization  to  partially  address  disparities  in  base  general-purpose 
funding  levels.    An  additional  $206  million  is  also  included  to  repay  over  half  of  the 
outstanding deficit factor owed due to reductions made in prior years to revenue limits and basic 
aid district categorical funding. 

•  Enrollment Growth – The Proposed 2006-07 Budget proposes $156 million augmentation to 
fully fund statutory ADA growth: $67.4 million for revenue limit apportionments, $14.8 million 
for child care and development, $4.7 million for class size reduction, $6.5 million for special 
education and $62.6 million for other categorical programs.  As a result of a steady decline in 
birth rates throughout the 1990’s, attendance growth in public schools continues to be low.  For 
the 2005-06 fiscal year, Statewide K-12 ADA is estimated to be 6,010,000, which is an increase 
of 28,000 ADA or 0.47 percent over the 2004-05 fiscal year, and is 21,000 ADA less than the 
2005-06  May  Revision  estimate.    For  the  2006-07  fiscal  year,  the  Administration  estimates 
Statewide  K-12  ADA  to  be  6,023,000.    This  total  reflects  ADA  growth  of  13,000  or  0.21 
percent over fiscal year 2005-06. 

•  COLAs  –  The  Proposed  2006-07  Budget  proposes  a  $2.3  billion  augmentation  to  provide  a 
5.18 percent statutory COLA adjustment: $1.7 billion for revenue limits, $70.2 million for child 
care  and  development,  $78.4  million  for  class-size  reduction,  $161.6  million  for  special 
education and $313.6 million for various categorical programs.   

•  State Department of Education – The State Department of Education administers State and 
federal education programs and operates the State Special Schools and Diagnostic Centers.  The 
Proposed  2006-07  Budget  includes  $313.3  million  ($123.7  million  General  Fund)  for  State 
operations, which reflects a decrease of $2 million ($3 million General Fund) below the revised 
fiscal year 2005-06 budget and an increase of $4.9 million ($1.3 million General Fund) above 
the 2005 Budget Act.  This reflects increases in both fiscal year 2005-06 and fiscal year 2006-
07.   

•  Expanding  After-School  Programs  –  In  2002,  California  voters  approved  Proposition 49, 
significantly  expanding  access  to  before  and  after-school  programs.    Proposition  49  also 
established funding priorities and expanded program activities to include computer training, fine 
arts and physical fitness.  In fiscal year 2005-06 the State After-School Education and Safety 
(“ASES”)  Program  was  funded  at  $121.6  million,  serving  more  than  100,000  annually.  
Beginning in fiscal year 2006-07, Proposition 49 will provided ASES with an increase of $428 
million over fiscal year 2005-06 funding levels. 

•  Augmentation for Mandated Local Programs –  The Governor proposes $133.6 million to 
fund  the  ongoing  cost  of  K-12  and  Community  College  locally-mandated  programs.    To  the 
extent this funding is insufficient to cover all eligible claims from local education agencies for 
the year, the State Controller is authorized to prorate payments proportionately.  Additionally, 

36 

 

$18.7 million is slated to be provided from the Proposition 98 Reversion Account to fund prior 
year mandate claims.   

•  Special  Education  –  The  Proposed  2006-07  Budget  provides  an  additional  $156.3  million 
General Fund for special education programs.  A local property tax increase of $17.4 million 
and an increase of $16 million in federal funds also are reflected in the Budget.  These increases 
include $161.6 million for a 5.18 percent COLA and $6.5 million for growth. 

•  School  Enrichment  Block  Grant  –    The  Governor  proposes  that  $100  million  be  made 
available  to  school  districts,  based  on  the  number  of  pupils  in  the  schools  whose  Academic 
Performance Index has placed them in the bottom three deciles, to support local strategies to 
recruit  and  retain  teachers  and  principals,  and  to  focus  on  hard-to-staff  subjects  and  low-
performing schools.  Funds will be allocated at a rate of approximately $50 per pupil with a 
district minimum of $5,000 per school site. 

Fiscal Year 2006/07 May Revision 

The  Governor’s  recently  released  May  Revision  indicates  that  California’s  economy  is  performing 
strongly during the first four months of 2005.  This economic strength, coupled with a surge in revenues tied to 
corporate  tax,  capital  gains,  and  stock  options,  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  projected  state  revenues  when 
compared to the Governor’s January Budget of $4.8 billion in the current year and $2.7 billion in the budget 
year, for a two-year increase of $7.5 billion. 

The  May  Revision  proposes  a  total  of  $2.3  billion  in  new  discretionary  K  through  12  education 
spending above levels contained in the 2005-06 state budget.  These resources are provided as cost-of-living 
adjustments, deficit reduction funding and revenue limit equalization funding. 

In  an  effort  to  resolve  the  pending  lawsuit  regarding  Proposition  98  funding,  the  Administration  is 
proposing to calculate the Proposition 98 guarantee consistent with the legislative intent language contained in 
Chapter  213,  Statutes  of  2004.    As  a  result,  the  state  will  pay  $3  billion  in  settle-up  funding,  comprised  of 
approximately $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion to count toward the 2004-05 and 2005-06 Proposition 98 guarantees 
for those years.  In order to provide resources for the initial years of the settlement schedule, the May Revision 
proposes  legislation  to  authorize  the  refinancing  of  the  Golden  State  Tobacco  Securitization  Corporation’s 
2003A bonds. 

For 2005-06, the May Revision reflects an increase of $2.0 billion from the Governor’s January Budget 

level of $62.1 billion.  For 2006-07, an increase of $896.2 million brings total funding to $67.1 billion. 

Funding  per  pupil  from  all  sources  for  2006-07  relative  to  the  Governor’s  January  Budget  increases 
$272,  from  $10,996  to  $11,268.   Revised per pupil funding of $10,749 in 2005-06 represents an increase of 
$413 from the Governor’s January Budget level of $10,336. 

The Governor’s Budget included funding of $54.3 billion for Proposition 98 in 2006-07.  this reflected 
$1.7  billion  in  spending  above  the  level  that  would  have  otherwise  been  required  by  the  Proposition  98 
guarantee and a $428 million increase to implement Proposition 49.  In the May Revision, the Administration is 
proposing  to  add  to  these  significant  investments  in  education  programs.    The  May  Revision  reflects  a 
Proposition 98 increase of $2.1 billion in 2005-06 and an increase of $756.8 million for 2006-07.  The May 
Revision continues to propose to spend at the level the Proposition 98 guarantee would be in 2006-07 assuming 
that the 2004-05 suspension had only been $2 billion.  It also continues to include $426 million above this level 
to implement Proposition 49. 

More  particular  information  concerning  the  May  Revision  can  be  found  at  the  State  of  California’s 

website at www.ebudget.ca.gov/Revised/BudgetSummary.

THE  STATE  HAS  NOT  ENTERED  INTO  ANY  CONTRACTUAL  COMMITMENT  WITH  THE 
DISTRICT, THE TRUSTEE, THE UNDERWRITERS OR THE OWNERS OF THE BONDS TO PROVIDE 
STATE BUDGET INFORMATION TO THE DISTRICT OR THE OWNERS OF THE BONDS.  ALTHOUGH 
THEY  BELIEVE  THE  STATE  SOURCES  OF  INFORMATION  LISTED  ABOVE  ARE  RELIABLE, 
NEITHER  THE  DISTRICT  NOR  THE  UNDERWRITER  ASSUMES  ANY  RESPONSIBILITY  FOR  THE 
ACCURACY OF THE STATE BUDGET INFORMATION SET FORTH HEREIN OR INCORPORATED BY 
REFERENCE HEREIN. 

Future  Budgets.    The  District  cannot  predict  what  actions  will  be  taken  in  the  future  by  the  State 
Legislature and the Governor to deal with the projected State budget deficit and the changing State revenues and 
expenditures.  The State Legislative Analyst projects the deficit for the current fiscal year to be approximately 
$6 billion.  Future State Budgets will be affected by national and state economic conditions and other factors.  
However, the obligation of the County to levy ad valorem taxes upon all taxable property within the District for 
the payment of the Bonds would not be impaired. 

It  should  not  be  inferred  from  the  inclusion  of  any  information  in  this  Official  Statement  that  the 
principal of or interest on the Bonds is payable from the general fund of the District.  The Bonds are payable 
from  the  proceeds  of  an  ad  valorem  tax  required  to  be levied  by  the  County  in  an  amount  sufficient  for  the 
payment of the Bonds.  See “THE BONDS - Security” herein.  The Bonds are the general obligations of the 
District  secured  by  ad  valorem  taxes  levied  an  collected  pursuant  to  the  Authorization,  the  California 
Constitution and State law and do not constitute an obligation of the County except to provide for the levy and 
collection of the ad valorem taxes levied and collected pursuant to the Authorization, the California Constitution 
and State law and do not constitute an obligation of the County except to provide for the levy and collection of 
the ad valorem taxes and payment of funds to the Paying Agent as set forth in the Resolution.  No part of any 
fund of the County is pledged or obligated to the payment of the Bonds. 

TAX BASE FOR REPAYMENT OF BONDS 

The information in this section describes ad valorem property taxation, assessed valuation, and other 
measures  of  the  tax  base  of  the  District.    The  Bonds  are  payable  solely  from  ad  valorem  taxes  levied  and 
collected by the County on taxable property in the District. The District’s general fund is not a source for the 
repayment of the Bonds. 

Ad Valorem Property Taxation 

Taxes  are  levied  by  the  County  for  each  fiscal  year  on  taxable  real  and  personal  property  which  is 
situated  in  the  County  as  of  the  preceding  January  1.    For  assessment  and  collection  purposes,  property  is 
classified either as “secured” or “unsecured” and is listed accordingly on separate parts of the assessment roll.  
The “secured roll” is that part of the assessment roll containing State-assessed public utilities property and real 
property having a tax lien which is sufficient, in the opinion of the County Assessor, to secure payment of the 
taxes.  Other property is assessed on the “unsecured roll.” 

Property taxes on the secured roll are due in two installments, on November 1 and February 1 of each 
fiscal year.  If unpaid, such taxes become delinquent on December 10 and April 10, respectively, and a 10% 
penalty  attaches  to  any  delinquent  payment.    Property  on  the  secured  roll  with  respect  to  which  taxes  are 
delinquent  becomes  tax  defaulted  on  or  about  June  30  of  the  fiscal  year.    Such  property  may  thereafter  be 
redeemed by payment of delinquent taxes and the delinquency penalty, plus costs and redemption penalty of one 
and one-half percent per month to the time of redemption.  If taxes are unpaid for a period of five years or more, 
the property is subject to sale by the County Treasurer. 

Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due as of the January 1 lien date and become delinquent, if 
unpaid, on August 31.  A 10% penalty attaches to delinquent taxes on property on the unsecured roll and an 
additional penalty of one and one-half percent per month begins to accrue on November 1.  The taxing authority 
has four ways of collecting delinquent unsecured personal property taxes:  (1) bringing a civil action against the 
taxpayer; (2) filing a certificate in the office of the County Clerk specifying certain facts in order to obtain a lien 
 

38 

 
on certain property of the taxpayer; (3) filing a certificate of delinquency for record in the County Clerk and 
County Recorder’s office in order to obtain a lien on certain property of the taxpayer; and (4) seizing and selling 
personal property, improvements, or possessory interests belonging or assessed to the assessee. 

Alternative Method of Tax Apportionment – Teeter Plan 

The Board of Supervisors of the County adopted the Alternative Method of Distribution of Tax Levies 
and Collections and of Tax Sale Proceeds (the “Teeter Plan”), as provided for in Section 4701 et seq. of the 
California Revenue and Taxation Code, “to accomplish a simplification of the tax levying and tax apportioning 
process and an increased flexibility in the use of available cash resources.”  This alternative method is used for 
distribution of the ad valorem property tax revenues. 

The County is responsible for determining the amount of the ad valorem tax levy on each parcel in the 
District, which is entered onto the secured real property tax roll.  Upon completion of the secured real property 
tax roll, the County auditor determines the total amount of taxes and assessments actually extended on the roll 
for each fund for which a tax levy has been included, and apportions 100% of the tax and assessment levies to 
that fund’s credit.  Such moneys may thereafter be drawn against by the taxing agency in the same manner as if 
the amount credited had been collected. 

Under  the  Teeter  Plan,  the  County  establishes  the  Tax  Loss  Reserve  Fund.    The  County  determines 
which moneys in the County treasury (including those credited to the Tax Loss Reserve Fund) shall be available 
to be drawn on to the extent of the amount of uncollected taxes credited to each find for which a levy has been 
included.    When  amounts  are  received  on  the  secured  tax  roll  for  the  current  year,  or  for  redemption  of  tax 
defaulted property, Teeter Plan moneys are distributed to the apportioned tax resources accounts. 

The  tax  losses  reserve  fund  is  used  exclusively  to  cover  lost  income  occurring  as  a  result  of  tax 
defaulted property.  Moneys in this fund are derived from several sources.  While amounts collected as costs are 
distributed to the County’s general fund, delinquent penalty collections are distributed to the tax losses reserve 
fund. 

When tax defaulted property is sold, the taxes and assessments which constitute the amount required to 
redeem the property are prorated between apportioned (Teeter) levies and unapportioned (or non Teeter) levies.  
The pro rata share for apportioned levies is distributed to the tax losses reserve fund.  The pro rata share from 
unapportioned levies is prorated between tax levies and assessment levies and then distributed to the applicable 
funds. 

If the tax losses reserve fund exceeds 1% of the total taxes and assessments levied on the secured roll for 
that year, the amounts coming in after it reaches 1% are credited to the County’s general fund.  Upon adoption 
of a resolution by the Board of Supervisors of the County by September 1 of any fiscal year, the 1% tax losses 
reserve fund threshold may be reduced to 25% of the total delinquent taxes and assessments for the previous 
year. 

The  Teeter  Plan  is  to  remain  in  effect  unless  the  Board  of  Supervisors  orders  its  discontinuance  or 
unless, prior to the commencement of any fiscal year of the County (which commences on July 1), the Board of 
Supervisors shall receive a petition for its discontinuance joined in be resolutions adopted by two thirds of the 
participating revenue district in the County, in which event the Board of Supervisors is to order discontinuance 
of the Teeter plan effective at the commencement of the subsequent fiscal year. 

The Board of Supervisors may, by resolution adopted not later than July 15 of the fiscal year for which 
it is to apply after holding a public hearing on the matter, discontinue the procedures under the Teeter Plan with 
respect  to  any  tax  levying  agency  or  assessment  levying  agency  in  the  County  if  the  rate  of  secure  tax 
delinquency  in  that  agency  in  any  year  exceeds  3%  of  the  total  of  all  taxes  and  assessments  levied  on  the 
secured rolls for that agency. 

 

39 

 

In the event that the Teeter Plan were terminated, receipt of revenue of ad valorem taxes in the District 
would  depend  upon  the collections of the ad valorem property taxes and delinquency rates experienced with 
respect to the parcels within the District. 

So long as the Teeter Plan remains in effect, the District’s receipt of revenues with respect to the levy of 
ad valorem property taxes will be not dependent upon actual collections of the ad valorem property taxes by the 
County.    However,  under  the  statute  creating  the  Teeter  Plan,  the  Board  of  Supervisors  could  under  certain 
circumstances (as described above) terminate the Teeter Plan in its entirely or terminate the Teeter Plan as to the 
District if the delinquency rate for all ad valorem property taxes levied within the District in any year exceeds 1 
%. 

Assessed Valuations 

The  assessed  valuation  of  property  in  the  District  is  established  by  the  County  Assessor,  except  for 
public utility property which is assessed by the State Board of Equalization.  Assessed valuations are reported at 
100% of the “full value” of the property, as defined in Article XIIIA of the California Constitution.  Prior to 
1981-82,  assessed  valuations  were  reported  at  25%  of  the  full  value  of  property.    For  a  discussion  of  how 
properties currently are assessed, see “CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING 
DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS.” 

Certain  classes  of  property,  such  as  churches,  colleges,  not-for-profit  hospitals,  and  charitable 
institutions, are exempt from property taxation and do not appear on the tax rolls.  No reimbursement is made by 
the State for such exemptions. 

Property  within  the  District  had  a  net  taxable  assessed  valuation  for  fiscal  year  2005-06  of 
$4,418,784,995.    Shown  in  the  following  table  are  the  assessed  valuations  for  the  District.    The  District’s 
assessed valuation increased by approximately 37% between fiscal year 2001-02 and fiscal year 2005-06.

Taxation of State-Assessed Utility Property 

A portion of property tax revenue of the District is derived from utility property subject to assessment 
by  the  State  Board  of  Equalization  (“SBE”).    State-assessed property, or “unitary property,” is property of a 
utility  system  with  components  located  in  many  taxing  jurisdictions  that  are  assessed  as  part  of  a  “going 
concern” rather than as individual pieces of real or personal property.  Unitary and certain other state-assessed 
property  is  allocated  to  the  counties  by  the  SBE,  taxed  at  special  county-wide  rates,  and  the  tax  revenues 
distributed to taxing jurisdictions (including the District) according to statutory formulae generally based on the 
distribution of taxes in the prior year. 

Recent changes in the California electric utility industry structure and in the way in which components 
of the industry are regulated and owned, including the sale of electric generation assets to largely unregulated, 
 

40 

 
nonutility companies, may affect how utility assets are assessed in the future, and which local agencies are to 
receive the property taxes.  The District is unable to predict the impact of these changes on its utility property 
tax revenues, or whether legislation or litigation may affect the State’s methods of assessing utility property and 
the allocation of assessed value to local taxing agencies, including the District. 

Because the District is not a basic aid district, taxes lost through any reduction in assessed valuation will 
be compensated by the State as equalization aid under the State’s school financing formula.  See “DISTRICT 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION” herein.

General Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 34. For the year ended June 30, 2003, the District 
was required to adopt GASB Statement No. 34 (GASB 34), Basic Financial Statements – and Management’s 
Discussion  and  Analysis  –  for  State  and  Local  Governments,  GASB  Statement  No.  37  (GASB  37),  Basic 
Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis for State and Local Governments: Omnibus, 
and GASB Statement No. 38 (GASB 38), Certain Financial Statement Note Disclosures.  GASB 34 significantly 
changes  the  way  state  and  local  governments  report  their financial  information  to  the  public.    As  a  result  of 
GASB 34, state and local governments are required to report financial information using both fund-based and 
government-wide financial statement presentations.  Fund-based statements continue to use the modified accrual 
basis of accounting, but the government-wide statement uses full accrual basis of accounting.  In addition to the 
change in the financial statement presentation, GASB 34 requires the reporting of capital assets and long-term 
obligations on the government-wide financial statements.  The preparation of a Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis to clarify the District’s financial activities is also required by GASB 34.  Furthermore, the District’s 
notes to the financial statements incorporate modifications as required under GASB 38.

Beginning  in  fiscal  year  2003-04,  the  District’s  audited  financials  were  prepared  by  the  accounting 
corporation of Nigro, Nigro & White, PC.  The change in accounting firms led to a slightly different format in 
which the general fund revenue and expenditures were reported.  The following table summarizes the District’s 
general fund revenue and expenditures for fiscal year 2003-04 and 2004-05.

Debt Obligations 

Set  forth  below  is  a  direct  and  overlapping  debt  report  (the  “Debt  Report”)  prepared  by  California 
Municipal  Statistics,  Inc.  for  debt  issued  as  of  October  1,  2005.    The  Debt  Report  is  included  for  general 
information purposes only.  The District has not reviewed the Debt Report for completeness or accuracy and 
makes no representation in connection therewith. 

Contained within the District are numerous overlapping local agencies providing public services.  These 
local  agencies  have  outstanding  bonds  issued  in  the  form  of  general  obligation,  lease  revenue  and  special 
assessment  bonds  and  outstanding  certificates  of  participation.    The  following  represents  the  total  assessed 
valuation  and  the  direct  and  overlapping  bonded  debt  of  the  District  as  of  October  1,  2005,  according  to 
California Municipal Statistics, Inc.  The District makes no assurance as to the accuracy of the following table, 
and  inquiries  concerning  the  scope  and  methodology  of  procedures  carried  out  to  complete  the  information 
presented should be directed to California Municipal Statistics, Inc. 

 

46 

 

The first column in the table names each public agency which has outstanding debt as of the date of the 
report and whose territory overlaps the District in whole or in part.  The second column shows the percentage of 
each  overlapping  agency’s  assessed  value  located  within  the  boundaries  of  the  District.    This  percentage, 
multiplied by the total outstanding debt of each overlapping agency (which is not shown in the table) produces 
the amount shown in the third column, which is the apportionment of each overlapping agency’s outstanding 
debt to taxable property in the District. 

The  direct  combined  debt  of  the  District  prior  to  the  issuance  of  the  Bonds  is  approximately 
$31,199,732, 0.55% of the approximately $4.4 billion 2005-06 assessed valuation of taxable property within the 
District.  The District’s general obligation bonding capacity is limited under State law to an amount equal to 
2.5% of the assessed valuation of taxable property within the District, or approximately $110 million for fiscal 
year 2005-06.

General Information 

THE DISTRICT 

The District was formed during the 1986-87 school year after voters approved unification in November 
1986  of  the  Apple  Valley  School  District,  a  portion  of  the  Victor  Valley  Elementary  School  District  and  a 
portion of the Victor Valley Joint Union High School District.  The District serves the Apple Valley region, a 
growing residential area east of Victorville in the high desert of the County of San Bernardino (the “County”).  
The District’s boundaries encompass both the Town of Apple Valley and certain unincorporated parts of the 
County.  The principal avenues of transportation to and from the District are Interstate 15 along the northwest 
side  of  the  District,  State  Highway  18  cross  the  District  east  and  west  and  the  Apple  Valley  Airport.    The 
District covers 209 square miles and has eight elementary schools, one kindergarten through eighth grade parent 
school of choice, two middle schools, two high schools, one continuation school, one adult education center and 
one charter school. 

Board of Trustees and Administration 

The District is governed by a five-member Board of Trustees (the “Board”), each member of which is 
elected to a four-year term.  Elections for positions to the Board are held every two years, alternating between 
two and three available positions.  Current members of the Board, together with their office and the date their 
term expires, are listed below:

Average Daily Attendance and Revenue Limit 

Beginning  in  1999/00,  the  State  computes  Average  Daily  Attendance  (“ADA”)  based  on  actual 
attendance only.  The following table sets forth the average daily attendance based on the Second Period Report 
of Attendance for the past five years: 

 

 
_________________ 
(1)  Includes grade levels K – 12 and special education.  All amounts are rounded to the nearest whole number. 
(2)  Average daily attendance for the second period of attendance, typically in mid-April of each school year. 
(3)  The State’s practice of deficit revenue limit funding, which reduced the amount of revenue limit funds received 
by school districts, was eliminated effective in fiscal year 2000-01. 
Source:  Apple Valley Unified School District. 

 

 

Revenue  limit  calculations  are  adjusted  annually  in  accordance  with  a  number  of  factors  designed 

primarily to provide cost of living increases and to equalize revenues among California school districts.

The District participates in the State of California Teachers’ Retirement System (“STRS”).  This plan 
covers most full-time certificated employees.  The required District contribution rate for fiscal year 2001-02 was 
8.25%  of  annual  payroll.    The  District’s  contribution  to  STRS  was  $2,646,753  for  fiscal  year  1999-00, 
$2,918,271  for  fiscal  year  2000-01,  $3,516,665.88  for  fiscal  year  2001-02,  $3,487,708  for  fiscal  year  2002-
2003,  $3,286,162.33  for  fiscal  year  2003-04,  $3,516,666  for  fiscal  year  2004-05,  and  $4,391,430  is  being 
budgeted  for  fiscal  year  2005-06.    The  District  also  participates  in  the  Public  Employees Retirement System 
(“PERS”).    This  plan  covers  all  classified  personnel  who  are  employed  more  than  four  hours  per  day.    The 
District  is  required  to  contribute  an  actuarially  determined  rate  to  this  plan.    The  actuarial  methods  and 
assumptions  used  for  determining  the  rate  are  those  adopted  by  the  PERS  Board  of  Administration.    The 
required District contribution rate for fiscal year 2002-03 was $987,899.  The District’s contribution to PERS 
was $1,886,408 for fiscal year 2003-04 $2,008,255 for fiscal year 2004-05 and $2,017,045 is budgeted for fiscal 
year 2005-06.  The District was not required to make contributions to PERS for fiscal years 1999-00, 2000-01 
and 2001-02. 

Insurance 

The  District  participates  in  two  joint  exercise  of  powers  agencies,  the  Southern  California  School 
Employee  Benefit  Association  (“SCSEBA”)  and  the  Southern  California  Schools  Risk  Management 
(“SCSRM”), to provide insurance coverage. 

SCSEBA  operates  and  maintains  four  insurance  benefit  plans;  dental,  vision,  life  and  medical  for  its 
members, including the District, SCSEBA is governed by a board consisting of representatives of each member 
district.  The board controls the operations of SCSEBA, including the selection of management and approval of 
operating  budgets,  independent  of  any  influence  of  the  member  districts  beyond  their  representation  on  the 
board.  Each member pays a premium commensurate with the level of coverage requested and share surpluses 
and deficits proportionate to is participation in SCSEBA. 

SCSRM  arranges  for  and  provides  workers’  compensation  coverage,  general  liability,  and  property 
coverage for all members, including the District.  SCSRM is governed by a board consisting of representatives 
of each member district.  The board controls the operations of SCSRM, including the selection of management 
and  approval  of  operating  budgets,  independent  of  any  influence  of  the  member  districts  beyond  their 
representation on the board.  Each member pays a premium commensurate with the level of coverage requested 
and shares surpluses and deficits proportionate to its participation in SCSRM.

Tax-Exempt Status of Interest 

TAX MATTERS 

In  the  opinion  of  Best  Best  &  Krieger  LLP,  Riverside,  California,  Bond  Counsel,  under  existing 
statutes,  regulations,  rulings  and  judicial  decisions,  interest  on  the  Bonds  is  excluded  from  gross  income  for 
federal  income  tax  purposes  and  is  not  an  item  of  tax  preference  for  purposes  of  calculating  the  federal 
alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  individuals  and  corporations.    In  the  further  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel, 
interest on the Bonds is exempt from State of California personal income tax.  Bond Counsel notes that, with 
respect to corporations, interest on the Bonds will be included as an adjustment in the calculation of alternative 
minimum taxable income, which may affect the alternative minimum taxable liability of such corporations. 

Bond  Counsel’s  opinion  as  to  the  exclusion  from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  of 
interest on the Bonds is based upon certain representations of fact and certifications made by the School District, 
the Underwriter and others and is subject to the condition that the School District complies with all requirements 
of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  “Code”)  that  must  be  satisfied  subsequent  to  the 
issuance of the Bonds to assure that interest on the Bonds will not become includable in gross income for federal 
income tax purposes.  Failure to comply with such requirements of the Code might cause interest on the Bonds

to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds.  
The School District has covenanted to comply with all such requirements. 

Should the interest on the Bonds become includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes, 
the Bonds are not subject to early redemption as a result of such occurrence and will remain outstanding until 
maturity or until otherwise redeemed in accordance with the Fiscal Agent Agreement. 

Bond  Counsel’s  opinion  may  be  affected  by  action  taken  (or  not  taken)  or  events  occurring  (or  not 
occurring) after the date of issuance of the Bonds.  Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine, or to inform 
any person, whether any such action or events are taken or do occur, or whether such actions or events may 
adversely  affect  the  value  or  tax  treatment  of  a  Bond  and  Bond  Counsel  expresses  no  opinion  with  respect 
thereto. 

The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) has initiated an expanded program for auditing tax-exempt 
bond issues, including both random and targeted audits.  It is possible that the Bonds will be selected for audit 
by the IRS.  It is also possible that the market value of the Bonds might be affected as a result of such audit (or 
by an audit of similar bonds). 

Although  Bond  Counsel  has  rendered  an  opinion  that  interest  on  the  Bonds  is  excluded  from  gross 
income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  provided  the  School  District  continues  to  comply  with  certain 
requirements of the Code, the accrual or receipt of interest on the Bonds may otherwise affect the tax liability of 
the recipient.  The extent of these other tax consequences will depend upon the recipient’s particular tax status 
and other items of income or deductions.  Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such consequences.  
Accordingly, all potential purchasers should consult their tax advisors before purchasing any of the Bonds. 

Original Issue Discount 

Certain  of  the  Bonds  (“Discount  Bonds”)  as  indicated  on  the  cover  of  this  Official  Statement  were 
offered and sold to the public at an original issue discount (“OID”).  OID is the excess of the stated redemption 
price at maturity (for the current interest bonds, the principal amount) over the “issue price” of a Discount Bond.  
The issue price of a Discount Bond is the initial offering price to the public (other than to bond houses, brokers 
or similar persons acting in the capacity of underwriters or wholesalers) at which a substantial amount of the 
Discount Bonds of the same maturity is sold pursuant to that offering.  For federal income tax purposes, OID 
accrues  to  the  owner  of  a  Discount  Bond  over  the  period  to  maturity  based  on  the  constant  yield  method, 
compounded  semiannually  (or  over  a  shorter  permitted  compounding  interval  selected  by  the  owner).    The 
portion of OID that accrues during the period of ownership of a Discount Bond (i) is interest excluded from the 
owner’s gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent, and subject to the same considerations 
discussed  above,  as  other  interest  on  the  Bonds,  and  (ii)  is  added  to  the  owner’s  tax  basis  for  purposes  of 
determining gain or loss on the maturity, redemption, prior sale or other disposition of that Discount Bond.  The 
amount  of  OID  that  accrues  each  year  to  a  corporate  owner  of  Discount  Bonds  is  taken  into  account  in 
computing the corporation’s liability for federal alternative minimum tax.  A purchaser of a Discount Bond in 
the initial public offering at the price for that Discount Bond stated on the cover of this Official Statement who 
holds that Discount Bond to maturity will realize no gain or loss upon the retirement of that Discount Bond. 

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE 

The District has covenanted for the benefit of holders and Beneficial Owners of the Bonds to provide 
certain financial information and operating data relating to the District (the “Annual Report”) by not later than 
nine months following the end of the District’s fiscal year (which shall be March 31 of each year, so long as the 
District’s fiscal year ends on June 30), commencing with the report for the 2005-06 fiscal year (which is due not 
later than March 31, 2007), and to provide notices of the occurrence of certain enumerated events, if material.  
The  Annual  Report  will  be  filed  by  the  District  with  each  Nationally  Recognized  Municipal  Securities 
Information Repository and with the appropriate State information depository, if any.  The notices of material 
events  will  be  filed  by  the  District  with  each  Nationally  Recognized  Municipal  Securities  Information 
Repository  or  with  the  Municipal  Securities  Rulemaking  Board,  and  with  the  appropriate  State  information 
 

56 

 
depository, if any.  The specific nature of the information to be contained the Annual Report and in the notices 
of material events is summarized under the caption “Appendix D - Form of Continuing Disclosure Certificate.”  
These  covenants  have  been  made  in  order  to  assist  the  Underwriter  in  complying  with  S.E.C.  Rule  15c2-
12(b)(5)  (the  “Rule”).    The  District  has  never  failed  to  comply  in  all  material  respects  with  any  previous 
undertakings with regard to said Rule to provide annual reports or notices of material events. 

LEGALITY FOR INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA 

Under  provisions  of  the  California  Financial  Code,  the  Bonds  are  legal  investments  for  commercial 
banks  in  California  to  the  extent  that  the  Bonds,  in  the  informed  opinion  of  the  bank,  are  prudent  for  the 
investment  of  funds  of  depositors,  and  under  provisions  of  the  California  Government  Code,  are  eligible  for 
security for deposits of public moneys in California. 

ABSENCE OF MATERIAL LITIGATION 

No  litigation  is  pending  or  threatened  concerning  the  validity  of  the  Bonds,  and  a  certificate  or 
certificates to that effect will be furnished to purchasers at the time of the original delivery of the Bonds.  The 
District is not aware of any litigation pending or threatened questioning the political existence of the District or 
contesting the District’s ability to receive ad valorem taxes or contesting the District’s ability to issue and retire 
the Bonds. 

CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS 

The validity of the Bonds and certain other legal matters are subject to the approving opinions of Best 
Best & Krieger LLP, as Bond Counsel, Disclosure Counsel and District Counsel.  Bond Counsel undertakes no 
responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of this Official Statement. 

RATING 

Standard & Poor’s has assigned a rating of “AAA” to the Bonds and Moody’s Investors Service has 
assigned a rating of “Aaa” to the Bonds with the understanding that a municipal bond insurance policy insuring 
payment when due of the principal of, Accreted Value, and interest on the Bonds will be issued on the closing 
date by MBIA and underlying ratings of “A” and “A3” by the respective rating agencies.  Such ratings reflect 
only the views of such organization and any desired explanation of the significance of such ratings should be 
obtained from the rating agencies, at the following addresses:  Standard & Poor’s, 55 Water Street, New York, 
New York 10041 and Moody’s Investors Service, 99 Church Street, New York, New York 10007.  Generally, a 
rating agency bases its rating on the information and materials furnished to it and on investigations, studies and 
assumptions of its own.  There is no assurance such ratings will continue for any given period of time or that 
such ratings will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the rating agency, if in the judgment of such 
rating  agencies,  circumstances  so  warrant.    Any  such  downward  revision  or  withdrawal  of  such  ratings  may 
have an adverse effect on the market price for the Bonds. 

UNDERWRITING 

The  Bonds  are  being  purchased  by  UBS  Securities  LLC  (the  “Underwriter”).    The  Underwriter  has 
agreed to purchase the Bonds at a price of $11,334,883.55, which is equal to the initial principal amount of the 
Bonds, plus an original issue premium with respect to the Current Interest Bonds and the Capital Appreciation 
Bonds, minus the Underwriter’s discount.  The Contract of Purchase provides that the Underwriter will purchase 
all of the Bonds if any are purchased, the obligation to make such purchase being subject to certain terms and 
conditions  set  forth  in  said  agreement,  the  approval  of  certain  legal  matters  by  counsel  and  certain  other 
conditions. 

The  Underwriter  has  furnished  the  initial  offering  prices  or  yields  shown  on  the  cover  hereof.    The 
Underwriter may offer and sell Bonds to certain dealers and others at prices lower than the offering prices stated 
on the cover page hereof.  The offering prices may be changed from time to time by the Underwriter.

Education  Code  (the  “Act”),  and  a  resolution  of  the  Board  of  Trustees  adopted  on  December  6,  2005  (the 
“Resolution”).    We  have  examined  the  law  and  such  certified  proceedings  and  other  papers  as  we  deemed 
necessary to render this opinion. 

As  to  questions  of  fact  material  to  our  opinion,  we  have  relied  upon  representations  of  the  District 
contained  in  the  Resolution  and  in  the  certified  proceedings  and  certifications  of  public  officials  and  others 
furnished to us, without undertaking to verify such facts by independent investigation. 

Based upon our examination, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that: 

The District is duly created and validly existing as a school district with the power to cause the 

Board to issue the Bonds in its name and to perform its obligations under the Resolution and the Bonds. 

1. 

2. 

The  Resolution  has  been  duly  adopted  by  the  District  and  constitutes  a  valid  and  binding 

obligation of the District enforceable upon the District. 

3. 

The Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the District and are valid and 
binding general obligations of the District is required under the Act to levy a tax upon all taxable property in the 
District for the interest, accreted value and redemption of all outstanding bonds of the District, including the 
Bonds. The Bonds are payable from an ad valorem tax levied without limitation as to rate or amount. 

4. 

The interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is 
not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals and 
corporations;  it  should  be  noted,  however,  that,  for  the  purpose  of  computing  the  alternative  minimum  tax 
imposed  on  corporations  (as  defined  for  federal  income  tax  purposes),  such  interest  is  taken  into  account  in 
determining  certain  income  and  earnings.  The  opinions  set  forth  in  the  preceding  sentence  are  subject  to  the 
condition  that  the  District  comply  with  all  requirements  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986  that  must  be 
satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest thereon be, or continue to be, excluded 
from  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  The  District  has  covenanted  to  comply  with  each  such 
requirement.  Failure  to  comply  with  certain  of  such  requirements  may  cause  the  inclusion  of  interest  on  the 
Bonds in gross income for federal income tax purposes to be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. 
We express no opinion regarding other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds. 

 

B-1 

 

5. 
California. 

The  interest  on  the  Bonds  is  exempt  from  personal  income  taxation  imposed  by  the  State  of 

6. 

The difference between the issue price of a Bond (the first price at which a substantial amount 
of the Bonds of a maturity is to be sold to the public) and the stated redemption price at maturity with respect to 
such Bonds constitutes original issue discount.  Original issue discount accrues under a constant yield method, 
and original issue discount will accrue to a Bondowner before receipt of cash attributable to such excludable 
income.  The amount of original issue discount deemed received by a Bondowner will increase the Bondowner’s 
basis in the applicable Bond.  Original issue discount that accrues to the Bondowner is excluded from the gross 
income  of  such  owner  for  federal  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  individuals  and  corporations,  and  is 
exempt from State of California personal income tax. 

The opinions expressed herein may be affected by actions taken (or not taken) or events occurring (or 
not occurring) after the date hereof.  We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any 
such actions or events are taken or do occur.  The Resolution and the Tax Certificate of the District relating to 
the Bonds permit certain actions to be taken or to be omitted if a favorable opinion of Bond Counsel is provided 
with  respect  thereto.    No  opinion  is  expressed  herein  ad  to the exclusion from gross income of interest (and 
original issue discount) for federal income tax purposes with respect to any Bond if any such action is taken or 
omitted based upon the advice of counsel other than ourselves.  Other than expressly stated herein, we express 
no opinion regarding tax consequences with respect to the Bonds. 

The  opinions  expressed  herein  as  to  the  exclusion  from  gross  income  of  interest  (and  original  issue 
discount) on the Bonds are based upon certain representations of fact and certifications made by the District and 
others and are subject to the condition that the District complies with all requirements of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds to assure 
that such interest (and original issue discount) will not become includable in gross income for federal income 
tax purposes.  Failure to comply with such requirements of the Code might cause interest (and original issue 
discount) on the Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of 
issuance  of  the  Bonds.    The  District  has  covenanted  in  the  Resolution  and  the  previously  mentioned  Tax 
Certificate to comply with all such requirements. 

The  rights  of  the  owners  of  the  Bonds  and  the  enforceability  thereof  may  be  subject  to  bankruptcy, 
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights heretofore or hereafter 
enacted, to the extent constitutionally applicable, and their enforcement may also be subject to the exercise of 
judicial discretion in appropriate cases. 

The  rights  of  the  owners  of  the  Bonds  and  the  enforceability  thereof  may  be  subject  to  bankruptcy, 
insolvency,  moratorium  and  other  similar  laws  affecting  creditors’  rights  heretofore  or  hereafter  enacted  and 
their enforcement may be subject to the exercise of judicial discretion in accordance with general principles of 
equity. 

Respectfully submitted,

change  in  law,  or  change  in  the  identity,  nature,  or  status  of  an  obligated  person  with  respect  to  the 
Bonds, or type of business conducted; 

 

C-3 

 

(b) 

the undertakings herein, as proposed to be amended or waived, would, in the opinion of 
nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with the requirements of the Rule at the time of the 
primary offering of the Bonds, after taking into account any amendments or interpretations of the Rule, 
as well as any change in circumstances; and 

(c) 

the proposed amendment or waiver either (i) is approved by holders of the Bonds in the

include a qualitative discussion of the differences in the accounting principles and the impact of the change in 
the  accounting  principles  on  the  presentation  of  the  financial  information,  in  order  to  provide  information  to 
investors to enable them to evaluate the ability of the District to meet its obligations.  To the extent reasonably

and  appropriate,  including  seeking  mandate  or  specific  performance  by  court  order,  to  cause  the  District  to 
comply with its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate.  A default under this Disclosure Certificate shall 
not be deemed an Event of Default under the Resolution, and the sole remedy under this Disclosure Certificate 
in the event of any failure of the District to comply with this Disclosure Certificate shall be an action to compel 
performance.

have  only  such  duties  as  are  specifically  set  forth  in  this  Disclosure  Certificate,  and  the  District  agrees  to

loss, expense and liabilities which they may incur arising out of or in the exercise or performance of its powers 
and duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) of defending against any claim
