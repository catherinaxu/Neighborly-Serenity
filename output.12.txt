See “RATING” herein. 
In the opinion of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, San Francisco, California, Bond Counsel, subject, however to certain 
qualifications described in this Official Statement, under existing law, interest on the Refunding Bonds is excluded from gross income 
for federal income tax purposes, and such interest is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax 
imposed  on  individuals  and  corporations,  although  for  the  purpose  of  computing  the  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  certain 
corporations, interest on the Refunding Bonds is taken into account in determining certain income and earnings, and the Refunding 
Bonds are “qualified tax-exempt  obligations” within the  meaning of  section  265(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue  Code of  1986.   In  the 
further  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel,  interest  on  the  Refunding  Bonds  is  exempt  from  California  personal  income  taxes.    See  “TAX 
MATTERS.”

The purpose of this Official Statement, which includes the cover page, inside cover page 
and attached appendices, is to set forth certain information concerning the sale and delivery of 
the  Refunding  Bonds  captioned  above  (the  “Refunding  Bonds”)  by  the  McKinleyville  Union 
School District (the “District”).  

INTRODUCTION 

 
This Introduction is not a summary of this Official Statement. It is only a brief description 
of and guide to, and is qualified by, more complete and detailed information contained in the 
entire Official Statement and the documents summarized or described in this Official Statement. 
A full review should be made of the entire Official Statement. The offering of Refunding Bonds 
to potential investors is made only by means of the entire Official Statement. 
 

The  District.  The  District  provides  services  to  the  community  of  McKinleyville.  The 
District operates two elementary schools and one middle school.  Enrollment in the District was 
1,179  students  in  fiscal  year  2013-14.    For  more  information  regarding  the  District  and  its 
finances, see Appendix B attached hereto.  See also Appendix C hereto for demographic and 
other statistical information regarding the County. 

 
Purpose. The Refunding Bonds are being issued by the District to refund all or a portion 
of  the  callable  portion  of  the  District’s  $6,999,907.50  General  Obligation  Bonds,  Election  of 
2008, Series B. See “THE REFINANCING PLAN” herein. 

 
Authority for Issuance of the Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds will be issued 
under the provisions of Articles 9 and 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the 
Government Code of the State of California (the “Bond Law”) and under a resolution adopted 
by the Board of Trustees of the District on August 13, 2014 (the “Bond Resolution”).  See “THE 
REFUNDING BONDS - Authority for Issuance” herein. 

 
Payment and Registration of the Refunding Bonds.  The Refunding Bonds are being 
issued  as  capital  appreciation  bonds.  The  interest  component  of  the  Refunding  Bonds  is 
compounded semiannually on each February 1 and August 1, commencing on February 1, 2015 
(each, a “Compounding Date”) to maturity as shown in the table of Accreted Values attached 
hereto.  See “APPENDIX G – Table of Accreted Values”. 

 
The Refunding Bonds will be dated the Dated Date, and will be issued as fully registered 
bonds,  without  coupons,  in  the  denominations  of  $5,000 Maturity  Value  (where  the  “Maturity 
Value” means the accreted value of a Refunding Bond on the date such Bond matures) and any 
integral  multiple  thereof.  The  Maturity  Value  of  each  Refunding  Bond  is  equal  to  its  accreted 
value  (“Accreted  Value”),  being  comprised  of  its  initial  principal  amount  (“Denominational 
Amount”) and the compounded interest between the delivery date and its respective maturity or 
mandatory redemption date, if applicable.

Bank  Qualified.    The  District  has  designated  the  Refunding  Bonds  as  "qualified  tax-
exempt obligations" pursuant to Section 265(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Such 
section provides an exception to the prohibition against the ability of a “financial institution” (as 
defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) to deduct its interest expense allocable to tax-
exempt interest.  See “TAX MATTERS” herein. 

 
Security and Sources of Payment for the Refunding Bonds.  The Refunding Bonds 
are general obligation bonds of the District payable solely from ad valorem property taxes levied 
and  collected  by  the  County.  The  County  is  empowered  and  is  obligated  to  annually  levy  ad 
valorem  taxes  for  the  payment  of  interest  on, and  principal  of,  the  Refunding  Bonds  upon  all 
property  subject  to  taxation  by  the  District,  without  limitation  of  rate  or  amount  (except  with 
respect  to  certain  personal  property  which  is  taxable  at  limited  rates).  See  “SECURITY  FOR 
THE REFUNDING BONDS.” 

 
The  District  has  another  series  of  general  obligation  bonds  that  is  payable  from  ad 
valorem taxes levied on taxable property in the District.  For a schedule of the debt service due 
on the general obligation bonds issued by the District, see “DEBT SERVICE SCHEDULE.” See 
also “THE REFINANCING PLAN.” 

 
Bond  Insurance.    Concurrently  with  the  issuance  of  the  Refunding  Bonds,  Build 
America Mutual Assurance Company (“BAM”) will issue its Municipal Bond Insurance Policy for 
the Refunding Bonds (the “Policy”).  The Policy guarantees the scheduled payment of principal 
of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due as set forth in the form of the Policy included 
as APPENDIX H to this Official Statement. See “BOND INSURANCE.” 

 
Other  Information.    This  Official  Statement  speaks  only  as  of  its  date,  and  the 
information  contained  in  this  Official  Statement  is  subject  to  change.  Copies  of  documents 
referred  to  in  this  Official  Statement  and  information  concerning  the  Refunding  Bonds  are 
available from the District.  The District may impose a charge for copying, mailing and handling. 

 
 

Redemption.  The Refunding Bonds are subject to redemption prior to their maturity as 

described in “THE REFUNDING BONDS - Redemption.”  

 
Tax  Matters.    Assuming  compliance  with  certain  covenants  and  provisions  of  the 
Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  in  the  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel,  interest  on  the  Refunding 
Bonds will not be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes although it may be 
includable in the calculation for certain taxes. Also, in the opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on 
the Series A Bonds will be exempt from State of California (the “State”) personal income taxes.  
See “TAX MATTERS” herein.

Refunded  Bonds  will  be  redeemed  at  a  price  equal  to  the  principal  amount  thereof,  plus  the 
redemption premium identified above. 

 
Sufficiency  of  the  deposits  in  the  Escrow  Fund  for  such  purposes  will  be  verified  by 
Causey,  Demgen  &  Moore,  certified  public  accountants,  Denver,  Colorado  (the  “Verification 
Agent”).  See “ESCROW VERIFICATION” herein.

Company, New York, New York (“DTC”).  Purchasers of the Refunding Bonds (the “Beneficial 
Owners”)  will  not  receive  physical  certificates  representing  their  interest  in  the  Refunding 
Bonds.  Payments of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds will be paid by U.S. Bank 
National  Association  (the  “Paying  Agent”)  to  DTC  for  subsequent  disbursement  to  DTC 
Participants which will remit such payments to the Beneficial Owners of the Refunding Bonds.   

 
As long as DTC’s book-entry method is used for the Refunding Bonds, the Paying Agent 
will send any notice of prepayment or other notices to owners only to DTC.  Any failure of DTC 
to advise any DTC Participant, or of any DTC Participant to notify any Beneficial Owner, of any 
such notice and its content or effect will not affect the validity or sufficiency of the proceedings 
relating to the prepayment of the Refunding Bonds called for prepayment or of any other action 
premised on such notice.  See “APPENDIX F - DTC AND THE BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM.” 

 
The  Paying  Agent,  the  District,  and  the  Underwriter  of  the  Refunding  Bonds  have  no 
responsibility or liability for any aspects of the records relating to or payments made on account 
of  beneficial  ownership,  or  for  maintaining,  supervising  or  reviewing  any  records  relating  to 
beneficial ownership, of interests in the Refunding Bonds. 

 
Bond Payments.  The Refunding Bonds will be dated the Dated Date and will accrete 
interest  from  such  date,  compounded  semiannually  each  February  1  and  August  1  (each,  a 
“Bond  Payment  Date”),  commencing  February  1,  2015,  at  the  interest  rates  shown  on  the 
inside front cover page of this Official Statement. The Refunding Bonds will mature on August 1 
in each of the years and in the principal amounts shown on the inside front cover page of this 
Official Statement.  Interest on the Refunding Bonds will be computed on the basis of a 360-day 
year of twelve 30-day months.  Each Bond authenticated on or before January 15, 2015, shall 
bear interest from the date of the Refunding Bonds. Each Bond authenticated during the period 
between the 15th day of the month preceding any Bond Payment Date (the “Record Date”) and 
that Bond Payment Date shall bear interest from that Bond Payment Date. Any other Bond shall 
bear interest from the Bond Payment Date immediately preceding the date of its authentication. 
If a Payment Date does not fall on a business day, the interest, principal or redemption payment 
due on such Payment Date will be paid on the next business day. The Refunding Bonds will be 
issued in the denomination of $5,000 principal amount each or any integral multiple thereof. 

 
See  the  maturity  schedules  on  the  inside  cover  page  of  this  Official  Statement  and 

“DEBT SERVICE SCHEDULE” herein. 

 

Redemption 

 
Optional Redemption.  The Refunding Bonds maturing on or after August 1, 2022, are 
subject  to  redemption  prior  to  their  respective  maturity  dates,  from  moneys  provided  at  the 

-5- 

option of the District, in each case on any date on and after August 1, 2021, at a redemption 
price equal to the Accreted Value of the Refunding Bonds to be redeemed, without premium. 

 
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption.  The Refunding Bonds maturing on August 1, 
2047  (the  “Term  Bonds”),  are  subject  to  mandatory  sinking  fund  redemption  on  August  1  of 
each years in accordance with the respective schedules set forth below at a redemption price 
equal to 100% of the Accreted Value thereof to be redeemed (without premium), together with 
interest  accrued  thereon  to  the  date  fixed  for  redemption.    The  Term  Bonds  so  called  for 
mandatory sinking fund redemption shall be redeemed in the sinking fund payments amounts 
and on the dates set forth below, without premium.

If some but not all of the Term Bonds have been optionally redeemed as described in 
the preceding section, the aggregate Accreted Value of Term Bonds to be redeemed pursuant 
to mandatory sinking fund redemption shall be reduced on a pro rata basis in integral multiples 
of $5,000, or on such other basis as designated pursuant to written notice filed by the District 
with the Paying Agent. 

 
Notice  of  Redemption.  The  Paying  Agent  will  cause  notice  of  any  redemption  to  be 
mailed, by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to 
the  date  fixed  for  redemption,  to  (i)  one  or  more  of  the  Information  Services,  and  (ii)  to  the 
respective Owners  of  any  Bonds  designated for  redemption,  at  their addresses appearing  on 
the Registration Books; but such mailing will not be a condition precedent to such redemption 
and failure to mail or to receive any such notice will not affect the validity of the proceedings for 
the redemption of such Bonds. 

 
The redemption notice will state the redemption date and the redemption price and, if 
less than all of the then Outstanding Bonds are to be called for redemption, will designate the 
Refunding Bonds to be redeemed, and will require that any redeemed Bonds be surrendered at 
the  Principal  Office  of  the  Paying  Agent  for  redemption,  giving  notice  that  further  interest  on 
such Bonds will not accrue from and after the redemption date. 

 
Partial Redemption. Upon surrender of Bonds redeemed in part only, the District will 
execute and the Paying Agent will authenticate and deliver to the owner, at the expense of the 
District, a new Bond or Bonds, of the same maturity, of authorized denominations in aggregate 
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Refunding Bond or Bonds. 

 
Effect of Redemption.  From and after the date fixed for redemption, if notice of such 
redemption  has  been  duly  given  and  funds  available  for  the  payment  of  the  principal  of  and 
interest (and premium, if any) on the Refunding Bonds so called for redemption have been duly 
provided,  such  Bonds so  called  will  cease  to  be  entitled  to  any  benefit  under  the Resolution, 
other  than  the  right  to  receive  payment  of  the  redemption  price,  and  no  interest  will  accrue 
thereon on or after the redemption date specified in such notice.   

-6- 

Right  to  Rescind  Notice  of  Redemption.    The  District  has  the  right  to  rescind  any 
notice of the optional redemption of Refunding Bonds by written notice to the Paying Agent on 
or  prior  to  the  dated  fixed  for  redemption.    Any  notice  of  redemption  shall  be  cancelled  and 
annulled if for any reason funds will not be or are not available on the date fixed for redemption 
for the payment in full of the Refunding Bonds then called for redemption.  The District and the 
Paying Agent shall have no liability to the Refunding Bond owners or any other party related to 
or  arising  from  such  rescission  of  redemption.    The  Paying  Agent  shall  mail  notice  of  such 
rescission  of  redemption  in  the  same  manner  as  the  original  notice  of  redemption  was  sent, 
except  that  the  time  period  for  giving  the  original  notice  of  redemption  shall  not  apply  to  any 
notice of rescission thereof. 

Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Bonds 

 
If the book-entry system as described above and in Appendix F is no longer used with 
respect to the Refunding Bonds, the following provisions will govern the registration, transfer, 
and exchange of the Refunding Bonds.   

 
Registration Books.  The Paying Agent will keep or cause to be kept sufficient books 
for the registration and transfer of the Refunding Bonds (the “Registration Books”), which will 
at all times be open to inspection by the District upon reasonable notice; and, upon presentation 
for  such  purpose,  the  Paying  Agent  shall,  under  such  reasonable  regulations  as  it  may 
prescribe,  register  or  transfer  or  cause  to  be  registered  or  transferred,  on  said  books,  the 
Refunding Bonds.  

 
Transfer.    Any  Bond  may,  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  be  transferred,  upon  the 
Registration  Books,  by  the  person  in  whose  name  it  is  registered,  in  person  or  by  his  duly 
authorized attorney, upon surrender of such Bond for cancellation at the principal office of the 
Paying Agent, accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer in a form approved by 
the Paying Agent, duly executed.   

 
Whenever any Bond or Bonds are surrendered for transfer, the District will execute and 
the Paying Agent will authenticate and deliver a new Bond or Bonds, for like aggregate principal 
amount.  No  transfers  will  be  required  to  be  made  (a)  15  days  prior  to  a  date  established  for 
selection  of  Bonds  for  redemption  and  (b)  with  respect  to  a  Bond  that  has  been  selected  for 
redemption. 

 
Exchange.  Bonds may be exchanged at the principal office of the Paying Agent for a 
like aggregate principal amount of Bonds of authorized denominations and of the same maturity. 
The District may charge a reasonable sum for each new Bond issued upon any exchange. No 
exchanges will be required to be made (a) 15 days prior to a date established for selection of 
Bonds for redemption and (b) with respect to a Bond that has been selected for redemption. 

Defeasance 

of the following ways: 

 
(a) 

 

 

 

 
The Refunding Bonds may be paid by the District, in whole or in part, in any one or more 

by paying or causing to be paid the principal or redemption price of and 
interest on such Refunding Bonds, as and when the same become due 
and payable; 

-7- 

by  irrevocably  depositing,  in  trust,  at  or  before  maturity,  money  or 
securities in the necessary amount (as provided in the Bond Resolution) 
to pay or redeem such Refunding Bonds; or 

by delivering such Refunding Bonds to the Paying Agent for cancellation 
by it. 

 
Whenever in the Bond Resolution it is provided or permitted that there be deposited with 
or  held  in  trust  by  the  Paying  Agent  money  or  securities  in  the  necessary  amount  to  pay  or 
redeem any Refunding Bonds, the money or securities so to be deposited or held may be held 
by the Paying Agent or by any other fiduciary. Such money or securities may include money or 
securities  held  by  the  Paying  Agent  in  the  funds  and  accounts  established  under  the  Bond 
Resolution and will be: 

lawful money of the United States of America in an amount equal to the 
principal amount of such Refunding Bonds and all unpaid interest thereon to maturity, 
except  that,  in  the  case  of  Bonds  which  are  to  be  redeemed  prior  to  maturity  and  in 
respect of which notice of such redemption is given as provided in the Bond Resolution 
or provision satisfactory to the Paying Agent is made for the giving of such notice, the 
amount to be deposited or held will be the principal amount or redemption price of such 
Refunding Bonds and all unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date; or 

(b) 

 
(c) 

 
(i) 

 
(ii) 

 

Federal Securities (not callable by the issuer thereof prior to maturity) the 
principal  of  and  interest  on  which  when  due,  in  the  opinion  of  a  certified  public 
accountant delivered to the District, will provide money sufficient to pay the principal or 
redemption price of and all unpaid interest to maturity, or to the redemption date, as the 
case  may  be,  on  the  Refunding  Bonds  to  be  paid  or  redeemed,  as  such  principal  or 
redemption  price  and  interest  become  due,  provided  that,  in  the  case  of  Refunding 
Bonds which are to be redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption 
has  been  given  as  provided  in  the  Bond  Resolution  or  provision  satisfactory  to  the 
Paying Agent has been made for the giving of such notice. 

 
Upon the deposit, in trust, at or before maturity, of money or securities in the necessary 
amount (as described above) to pay or redeem any outstanding Refunding Bond (whether upon 
or prior to its maturity or the redemption date of such Refunding Bond), then all liability of the 
County  and  the  District  in  respect  of  such  Refunding  Bond  will  cease  and  be  completely 
discharged, except only that thereafter the owner thereof will be entitled only to payment of the 
principal  of  and  interest  on  such  Refunding  Bond  by  the  District,  and  the  District  will  remain 
liable  for  such  payment,  but  only  out  of  such  money  or  securities  deposited  with  the  Paying 
Agent for such payment. 

 
“Federal Securities” means (a) any direct general obligations of the United States of 
America (including obligations issued or held in book entry form on the books of the Department 
of the Treasury of the United States of America), for which the full faith and credit of the United 
States of America are pledged; (b) obligations of any agency, department or instrumentality of 
the United States of America, the timely payment of principal and interest on which are directly 
or indirectly secured or guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.

SECURITY FOR THE REFUNDING BONDS 

 
Ad Valorem Taxes 
 

Bonds Payable from Ad Valorem Property Taxes.  The Refunding Bonds are general 
obligations of the District, payable solely from ad valorem property taxes levied and collected by 
the County.  The County is empowered and is obligated to annually levy ad valorem taxes for 
the  payment  of  the  Refunding  Bonds  and  the  interest  thereon  upon  all  property  within  the 
District  subject  to  taxation  by  the  District,  without  limitation  of  rate  or  amount  (except  certain 
personal property which is taxable at limited rates).   

 
Other  Bonds  Payable  from  Ad  Valorem  Property  Taxes.  The  District  has  other 
outstanding bonded indebtedness payable from ad valorem taxes.   See Appendix B under the 
heading “Existing Debt Obligations.” Such indebtedness, together with debt service payable on 
the Refunding Bonds, is all payable from ad valorem taxes on a parity basis. 

 
In  addition  to  the  general  obligation  bonds  issued  by  the  District,  there  is  other  debt 
issued by entities with jurisdiction in the District, which is payable from ad valorem taxes levied 
on  parcels  in  the  District.  See  “PROPERTY  TAXATION  –  Tax  Rates”  and  “-  Direct  and 
Overlapping Debt” below. 

 
Levy and Collection.  The County will levy and collect such ad valorem taxes in such 
amounts and at such times as is necessary to ensure the timely payment of debt service.  Such 
taxes, when collected, will be deposited into a debt service fund for the Refunding Bonds, which 
is  maintained  by  the  County  Office  of  Education  and  which  is  irrevocably  pledged  for  the 
payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due.  

 
District property taxes are assessed and collected by the County in the same manner 
and at the same time, and in the same installments as other ad valorem taxes on real property, 
and  will  have  the  same  priority,  become  delinquent  at  the  same  times  and  in  the  same 
proportionate  amounts,  and  bear  the  same  proportionate  penalties  and  interest  after 
delinquency,  as  do  the  other  ad  valorem  taxes  on  real  property.    As  described  below,  the 
County  has  adopted  the  Teeter  Plan  so  secured  tax  revenues  do  not  reflect  the  county-wide 
delinquency rates. 

 
Annual Tax Rates.  The amount of the annual ad valorem tax levied by the County to 
repay  the  Refunding  Bonds  will  be  determined  by  the  relationship  between  the  assessed 
valuation of taxable property in the District and the amount of debt service due on the Refunding 
Bonds.  Fluctuations in the annual debt service on the Refunding Bonds and the assessed value 
of taxable property in the District may cause the annual tax rate to fluctuate.   

 
Economic and other factors beyond the District’s control, such as economic recession, 
deflation of land values, a relocation out of the District or financial difficulty or bankruptcy by one 
or  more  major  property  taxpayers,  or  the  complete  or  partial  destruction  of  taxable  property 
caused  by,  among  other  eventualities,  earthquake,  flood,  fire  or  other  natural  disaster,  could 
cause  a  reduction  in  the  assessed  value  within  the  District  and  necessitate  a  corresponding 
increase in the annual tax rate.  

 

-11- 

Debt Service Fund 

 
The County Office of Education will establish a Debt Service Fund (the “Debt Service 
Fund”) for the Refunding Bonds, which will be established as a separate fund to be maintained 
distinct from all other funds of the County.  All taxes levied by the County Office of Education for 
the payment of the principal of and interest and premium (if any) on the Refunding Bonds will be 
deposited in the Debt Service Fund by the County promptly upon the receipt.  The Debt Service 
Fund  is  pledged  for  the  payment  of  the  principal  of  and interest  and premium  (if  any)  on  the 
Refunding Bonds when and as the same become due.  The District will transfer amounts in the 
Debt  Service  Fund  to  the  Paying  Agent  to  the  extent  necessary  to  pay  the  principal  of  and 
interest and premium (if any) on the Refunding Bonds as the same becomes due and payable. 

 
If,  after  payment  in  full  of  the  Refunding  Bonds,  any  amounts  remain  on  deposit  in  a 
Debt Service Fund, the District shall transfer such amounts to its General Fund, to be applied 
solely in a manner which is consistent with the requirements of applicable state and federal tax 
law. 

 

 

Not a County Obligation 

 
The Refunding Bonds are payable solely from the proceeds of an ad valorem tax levied 
and collected by the County, for the payment of principal and interest on the Refunding Bonds.  
Although the County is obligated to collect the ad valorem tax for the payment of the Refunding 
Bonds, the Refunding Bonds are not a debt of the County.

PROPERTY TAXATION 

Property Tax Collection Procedures 

 
In California, property which is subject to ad valorem taxes is classified as “secured” or 
“unsecured.”  The “secured roll” is that part of the assessment roll containing state assessed 
public utilities’ property and property, the taxes on which are a lien on real property sufficient, in 
the opinion of the county assessor, to secure payment of the taxes.  A tax levied on unsecured 
property does not become a lien against such unsecured property, but may become a lien on 
certain  other  property  owned  by  the  taxpayer.    Every  tax  which  becomes  a  lien  on  secured 
property has priority over all other liens arising pursuant to State law on such secured property, 
regardless of the time of the creation of the other liens.  Secured and unsecured property are 
entered separately on the assessment roll maintained by the county assessor.  The method of 
collecting delinquent taxes is substantially different for the two classifications of property. 

 

 

 
Property  taxes  on  the  secured  roll  are  due  in  two  installments,  on  November  1  and 
February 1 of each fiscal year.  If unpaid, such taxes become delinquent after December 10 and 
April  10,  respectively,  and  a  10%  penalty  attaches  to  any  delinquent  payment.    In  addition, 
property on the secured roll with respect to which taxes are delinquent is declared tax defaulted 
on or about June 30 of the fiscal year.  Such property may thereafter be redeemed by payment 
of  the  delinquent  taxes  and  a  delinquency  penalty,  plus  a  redemption  penalty  of  1-1/2%  per 
month  to  the  time  of  redemption.    If  taxes  are  unpaid  for  a  period  of  five  years  or  more,  the 
property is subject to sale by the County. 

 
Property  taxes  are  levied  for  each  fiscal  year  on  taxable  real  and  personal  property 
situated in the taxing jurisdiction as of the preceding January 1.  A bill enacted in 1983, SB813 
(Statutes  of  1983,  Chapter  498),  however,  provided  for  the  supplemental  assessment  and 
taxation  of  property  as  of  the  occurrence  of  a  change  of  ownership  or  completion  of  new 
construction.    Thus,  this  legislation  eliminated  delays  in  the  realization  of  increased  property 
taxes  from  new  assessments.    As  amended,  SB813  provided  increased  revenue  to  taxing 
jurisdictions  to  the  extent  that  supplemental  assessments  of  new  construction  or  changes  of 
ownership occur subsequent to the January 1 lien date and result in increased assessed value. 

 
Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due on the January 1 lien date and become 
delinquent, if unpaid on the following August 31.  A 10% penalty is also attached to delinquent 
taxes in respect of property on the unsecured roll, and further, an additional penalty of 1-1/2% 
per month accrues with respect to such taxes beginning the first day of the third month following 
the  delinquency  date.    The  taxing  authority  has  four  ways  of  collecting  unsecured  personal 
property taxes: (1) a civil action against the taxpayer; (2) filing a certificate in the office of the 
county clerk specifying certain facts in order to obtain a judgment lien on certain property of the 
taxpayer; (3) filing a certificate of delinquency for record in the county recorder’s office, in order 
to  obtain  a  lien  on  certain  property  of  the  taxpayer;  and  (4)  seizure  and  sale  of  personal 
property, improvements or possessory interests belonging or assessed to the assessee.  The 
exclusive  means  of  enforcing  the  payment  of  delinquent  taxes  in  respect  of  property  on  the 
secured  roll  is  the  sale  of  the  property  securing  the  taxes  for  the  amount  of  taxes  which  are 
delinquent.

Taxation of State-Assessed Utility Property 

 
The  State  Constitution  provides  that  most  classes  of  property  owned  or  used  by 
regulated  utilities  be  assessed  by  the  State  Board  of  Equalization  (“SBE”)  and  taxed  locally.  
Property valued by the SBE as an operating unit in a primary function of the utility taxpayer is 
known as “unitary property”, a concept designed to permit assessment of the utility as a going 
concern rather than assessment of each individual element of real and personal property owned 
by  the  utility  taxpayer.    State-assessed  unitary  and  “operating  nonunitary”  property  (which 
excludes  nonunitary  property  of  regulated  railways)  is  allocated  to  the  counties  based  on  the 
situs of the various components of the unitary property.  Except for unitary property of regulated 
railways  and  certain  other  excepted  property,  all  unitary  and  operating  nonunitary  property  is 
taxed  at  special  county-wide  rates  and  tax  proceeds  are  distributed  to  taxing  jurisdictions 
according to statutory formulae generally based on the distribution of taxes in the prior year.

Appeals of Assessed Value 

 

 
There are two types of appeals of assessed values that could adversely impact property 

tax revenues within the District. 
 

Appeals may be based on Proposition 8 of November 1978, which requires that for each 
January 1 lien date, the taxable value of real property must be the lesser of its base year value, 
annually adjusted by the inflation factor pursuant to Article XIIIA of the State Constitution, or its 
full cash value, taking into account reductions in value due to damage, destruction, depreciation, 
obsolescence,  removal  of  property  or  other  factors  causing  a  decline  in  value.    See 
“CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT  REVENUES 
AND APPROPRIATIONS – Article XIIIA of the California Constitution” in Appendix B.  
 

Under California law, property owners may apply for a Proposition 8 reduction of their 
property tax assessment by filing a written application, in form prescribed by the State Board of 
Equalization,  with  the  County  board  of  equalization  or  assessment  appeals  board.    In  most 

-18- 

cases, the appeal is filed because the applicant believes that present market conditions (such 
as residential home prices) cause the property to be worth less than its current assessed value.  
Proposition 8 reductions may also be unilaterally applied by the County Assessor. 
 

Any reduction in the assessment ultimately granted as a result of such appeal applies to 
the year for which application is made and during which the written application was filed.  These 
reductions are subject to yearly reappraisals and are adjusted back to their original values when 
market  conditions  improve.    Once  the  property  has  regained  its  prior  value,  adjusted  for 
inflation,  it  once  again  is  subject  to  the  annual  inflationary  factor  growth  rate  allowed  under 
Article XIIIA. 
 

A second type of assessment appeal involves a challenge to the base year value of an 
assessed  property.    Appeals  for  reduction  in  the  base  year  value  of  an  assessment,  if 
successful, reduce the assessment for the year in which the appeal is taken and prospectively 
thereafter.  The base year is determined by the completion date of new construction or the date 
of change of ownership.  Any base year appeal must be made within four years of the change of 
ownership or new construction date.  

 
The  District  cannot  predict  the  changes  in  assessed  values  that  might  result  from 
pending or future appeals by taxpayers.  Any reduction in aggregate District assessed valuation 
due to appeals, as with any reduction in assessed valuation due to other causes, will cause the 
tax  rate  levied  to  repay  the  Refunding  Bonds  to  increase  accordingly,  so  that  the  fixed  debt

Property Tax Collections 

 
The  District’s  total  secured  tax  collections  and  delinquencies  are  apportioned  on  a 
County-wide basis, according to the District’s designated tax rate amount.  Therefore, the total 
secured  tax  levies,  as  well  as  collections  and  delinquencies  reported,  do  not  represent  the 
actual secured tax levies, collections and delinquencies of tax payers within the tax areas of the 
District.  In addition, the District’s total secured tax levy does not include special assessments, 
supplemental taxes or other charges which have been assessed on property within the District 
or other tax rate areas of the County. 

 
The  County  has  adopted  the  Alternative  Method  of  Distribution  of  Tax  Levies  and 
Collections and of Tax Sale Proceeds (the "Teeter Plan") as provided for in the State Revenue 
and Taxation Code, which requires the County to pay 100% of secured property taxes due to 
local  agencies  in  the  fiscal  year  such  taxes  are  due.    Under  these  provisions,  each  county 
operating under the Teeter Plan establishes a delinquency reserve and assumes responsibility 
for all secured delinquencies, assuming that certain conditions are met. 

 
Because of this method of tax collection, the K-12 districts located in counties operating 
under  the  Teeter  Plan and  participating  in  the Teeter  Plan  are  assured  of  100% collection  of 
their secured tax levies if the conditions established under the applicable county’s Teeter Plan 
are  met.    However,  such  districts  are  no  longer  entitled  to  share  in  any  penalties  due  on 
delinquent payments or in the interest which accrues on delinquent payments.  

 
The  Teeter  Plan  is  to  remain  in  effect  unless  the  Board  of  Supervisors  orders  its 
discontinuance or unless, prior to the commencement of any fiscal year of the County (which 
commences on July 1), the Board of Supervisors has received a petition for its discontinuance 
joined in by resolutions adopted by two thirds of the participating revenue districts in the County, 
in which event the Board of Supervisors is required to order discontinuance of the Teeter Plan 
effective at the commencement of the subsequent fiscal year. 

 
The Board of Supervisors may, by resolution adopted not later than July 15 of the fiscal 
year  for  which  it  is  to  apply  after  holding  a  public  hearing  on  the  matter,  discontinue  the 
procedures under the Teeter Plan with respect to any tax levying agency or assessment levying 
agency in the County if the rate of secured tax delinquency in that agency in any year exceeds 
3% of the total of all taxes and assessments levied on the secured rolls for that agency. In the 
event that the Teeter Plan was terminated, the amount of the levy of ad valorem taxes in the 
District would depend upon the collections of the  ad valorem property taxes and delinquency 
rates experienced with respect to the parcels within the District. 

 
So  long  as  the  Teeter  Plan  remains  in  effect  with  respect  to  the  District,  the  District's 
receipt of revenues with respect to the levy of ad valorem property taxes will not be dependent 
upon actual collections of the ad valorem property taxes by the County.

Direct and Overlapping Debt 

 
Set forth below is a direct and overlapping debt report (the “Debt Report”) prepared by 
California Municipal Statistics, Inc. for debt issued as of September 1, 2014. The Debt Report is 
included for general information purposes only. The District has not reviewed the Debt Report 
for completeness or accuracy and makes no representation in connection therewith. 

 
The  Debt  Report  generally  includes  long-term  obligations  sold  in  the  public  credit 
markets by public agencies whose boundaries overlap the boundaries of the District in whole or 
in  part.  Such  long-term  obligations  generally  are  not  payable  from  revenues  of  the  District 
(except as indicated) nor are they necessarily obligations secured by land within the District. In 
many cases, long-term obligations issued by a public agency are payable only from the general 
fund or other revenues of such public agency.

TAX MATTERS 

 
Tax Exemption 

 
Federal Tax Status.  In the opinion of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, San 
Francisco,  California,  Bond  Counsel,  subject,  however  to  the  qualifications  set  forth  below, 
under  existing  law,  the  interest  on  the  Refunding  Bonds  is  excluded  from  gross  income  for 
federal income tax purposes and such interest is not an item of tax preference for purposes of 
the federal alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations, although for the 
purpose  of  computing  the  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  certain  corporations,  such 
interest is taken into account in determining certain income and earnings. The Refunding Bonds 
are  "qualified  tax-exempt  obligations"  within  the  meaning  of  Section  265(b)(3)  of  the  Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Tax Code”) such that, in the case of certain financial institutions 
(within  the  meaning  of  section  265(b)(5)  of  the  Code),  a  deduction  for  federal  income  tax 
purposes is allowed for 80 percent of that portion of such financial institution's interest expense 
allocable to interest payable on the Refunding Bonds. 

 
The opinions set forth in the preceding paragraph are subject to the condition that the 
District comply with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
“Tax Code”) that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Refunding Bonds.  The 
District has covenanted to comply with each such requirement.  Failure to comply with certain of 
such requirements may cause the inclusion of such interest in gross income for federal income 
tax purposes to be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Refunding Bonds.  We express no 
opinion regarding other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the Refunding Bonds.  

 
Bank Qualified. The Code generally prohibits the deduction of interest on indebtedness 
incurred  or  continued  to  purchase  or  carry  tax-exempt  obligations,  such  as  the  Refunding 
Bonds.    Banks  and  financial  institutions,  however,  are  permitted  an  80%  deduction  for  their 
interest expense allocable to “qualified tax-exempt obligations” of small governmental units (a) 
that  together  with  their  subordinate  entities  or  entities  issuing  on  their  behalf  and  entities  on 
whose  behalf  they  issue  do  not  reasonably  expect  to  issue  in  the  aggregate  more  than 
$10,000,000 of tax-exempt obligations (not including private activity bonds other than qualified 
501(c)(3) bonds in a calendar year), and (b) that designate such obligations as “qualified tax-
exempt obligations”.  By resolution, the District has (a) represented that it expects that it and all 
of the above-described entities will not issue in the aggregate more than $10,000,000 of tax-
exempt  obligations  during  calendar  year  2014,  and  (b)  designated  the  Refunding  Bonds  as 
“qualified tax-exempt obligations”. 

 
Tax Treatment of Original Issue Discount and Premium. If the initial offering price to 
the public (excluding bond houses and brokers) at which a Refunding Bond is sold is less than 
the  amount  payable  at  maturity  thereof,  then  such  difference  constitutes  "original  issue 
discount" for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income taxes. 
If  the  initial  offering  price  to  the  public  (excluding  bond  houses  and  brokers)  at  which  a 
Refunding  Bond  is  sold  is  greater  than  the  amount  payable  at  maturity  thereof,  then  such 
difference  constitutes  "original  issue  premium"  for  purposes  of  federal  income  taxes  and 
State of California personal income taxes.  De minimis original issue discount and original issue 
premium is disregarded.  

 

 

-23- 

Under the Tax Code, original issue discount is treated as interest excluded from federal 
gross income and exempt from State of California personal income taxes to the extent properly 
allocable to each owner thereof subject to the limitations described in the first paragraph of this 
section.  The original issue discount accrues over the term to maturity of the Refunding Bond on 
the  basis  of  a  constant  interest  rate  compounded  on  each  interest  or  principal  payment  date 
(with  straight-line  interpolations  between  compounding  dates).    The  amount  of  original  issue 
discount accruing during each period is added to the adjusted basis of such Refunding Bonds to 
determine taxable gain upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity) of 
such  Refunding  Bond.    The  Tax  Code  contains  certain  provisions  relating  to  the  accrual  of 
original  issue  discount  in  the  case  of  purchasers  of  the  Refunding  Bonds  who  purchase  the 
Refunding Bonds after the initial offering of a substantial amount of such maturity.  Owners of 
such  Refunding  Bonds  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  with  respect  to  the  tax 
consequences  of  ownership  of  Refunding  Bonds  with  original  issue  discount,  including  the 
treatment  of  purchasers  who  do  not  purchase  in  the  original  offering,  the  allowance  of  a 
deduction for any loss on a sale or other disposition, and the treatment of accrued original issue 
discount on such Refunding Bonds under federal individual and corporate alternative minimum 
taxes. 

 
Under the Tax Code, original issue premium is amortized on an annual basis over the 
term of the Refunding Bond (said term being the shorter of the Refunding Bond's maturity date 
or  its  call  date).    The  amount  of  original  issue  premium  amortized  each  year  reduces  the 
adjusted basis of the owner of the Refunding Bond for purposes of determining taxable gain or 
loss upon disposition.  The amount of original issue premium on a Refunding Bond is amortized 
each year over the term to maturity of the Refunding Bond on the basis of a constant interest 
rate  compounded  on  each  interest  or  principal  payment  date  (with  straight-line  interpolations 
between compounding dates).  Amortized bond premium is not deductible for federal income tax 
purposes.  Owners of premium Refunding Bonds, including purchasers who do not purchase in 
the  original  offering,  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  with  respect  to  State  of  California 
personal income tax and federal income tax consequences of owning such Refunding Bonds. 

 
California  Tax  Status.    In  the  further  opinion  of  Bond  Counsel,  interest  on  the 

Refunding Bonds is exempt from California personal income taxes. 

 
Form of Opinion.  A copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is attached 

hereto as Appendix D.  

 

Other Tax Considerations 
 

Owners of the Refunding Bonds should also be aware that the ownership or disposition 
of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Refunding Bonds may have federal or state tax 
consequences other than as described above.  Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding 
any federal or state tax consequences arising with respect to the Refunding Bonds other than 
as expressly described above. 

 
Future legislation, if enacted into law, or clarification of the Tax Code may cause interest 
on  the  Refunding  Bonds  to  be  subject  to,  directly  or  indirectly,  to  federal  income  taxation,  or 
otherwise prevent owners of the Refunding Bonds from realizing the full current benefit of the 
tax  status  of  such  interest.    The  introduction  or  enactment  of  any  such  future  legislation  or 
clarification  of  the  Tax  Code  may  also  affect  the  market  price  for,  or  marketability  of,  the 
Refunding Bonds.  Prospective purchasers of the Refunding Bonds should consult their own tax 

-24- 

 

 
Legality for Investment 
 

 

 

Under  provisions  of  the  California  Financial  Code,  the  Refunding  Bonds  are  legal 
investments for commercial banks in California to the extent that the Refunding Bonds, in the 
informed opinion of the bank, are prudent for the investment of funds of depositors, and under 
provisions  of  the  California  Government  Code,  the  Refunding  Bonds  are  eligible  to  secure 
deposits of public moneys in California. 

Absence of Litigation 
 

No  litigation  is  pending  or  threatened  concerning  the  validity  of  the  Refunding  Bonds, 
and a certificate to that effect will be furnished to purchasers at the time of the original delivery 
of the Refunding Bonds. The District is not aware of any litigation pending or threatened that (i) 
questions  the  political  existence  of  the  District,  (ii)  contests  the  District's  ability  to  receive  ad 
valorem taxes or to collect other revenues or (iii) contests the District's ability to issue and retire 
the Refunding Bonds. 

 
The District is routinely subject to lawsuits and claims. In the opinion of the District, the 
aggregate amount of the uninsured liabilities of the District under these lawsuits and claims will 
not materially affect the financial position or operations of the District. 

 

Compensation of Certain Professionals 
 

Payment of the fees and expenses of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, as 
Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel to the District, and Isom Advisors, A Division of Urban 
Futures, Inc., as financial advisor to the District, is contingent upon issuance of the Refunding 
Bonds. 

advisors regarding any pending or proposed federal tax legislation, as to which Bond Counsel 
expresses no opinion. 

CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS 

 
 

 

 

-25- 

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE 

 

The  District  will  execute  a  Continuing  Disclosure  Certificate  in  connection  with  the 
issuance of the Refunding Bonds in the form attached hereto as Appendix D.  The District has 
covenanted therein, for the benefit of holders and beneficial owners of the Refunding Bonds to 
provide  certain  financial  information  and  operating  data  relating  to  the  District  (an  “Annual 
Report”)  to  the  Municipal  Securities  Rulemaking  Board  (the  “MSRB”)  not  later  than  nine 
months  after  the  end  of  the  District’s  fiscal  year  (which  currently  would  be  March  31), 
commencing March 31, 2015 with the report for the 2013-14 Fiscal Year, and to provide notices 
of the occurrence of certain enumerated events. Such notices will be filed by the District with the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.  The specific nature of the information to be contained 
in an Annual Report or the notices of enumerated events is set forth in “APPENDIX D – FORM 
OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE CERTIFICATE.”  These covenants have been made in order 
to assist the Underwriter of the Refunding Bonds in complying with S.E.C. Rule 15c2-12(b)(5) 
(the “Rule”).  

 
The District has existing disclosure undertakings that have been made pursuant to the 
Rule in connection with the issuance of the District’s outstanding general obligation bonds (see 
information in Appendix B under the heading “DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION – Existing 
Debt  Obligations”).    Specific  instances  of  non-compliance  with  such  undertakings  in  the 
previous five years include (but may not be limited to) the following:  

 
 

-26- 

 
(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

(iv) 

the  annual  report,  including  the  audited  financial  statements,  for  the  fiscal 
year ended June 30, 2009 was filed with the MSRB, but such filing was late 
and  was  missing  certain  required  information  or  was  not  filed  in  the  proper 
form; 
the  annual  report,  including  the  audited  financial  statements,  for  the  fiscal 
year  ending  June  30,  2012  was  filed  with  the  MSRB,  but  such  filing  was 
missing certain required information or was not filed in the proper form; 
the  District  failed  to  file  its  annual  report  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  June  30, 
2013; and 
the District did not file certain event notices, such as rating changes for bond 
insurers, and may not have filed certain other event notices on a timely basis. 

 
The preceding instances of noncompliance by the District with its continuing disclosure 
undertakings  should  not  be  construed  as  an  acknowledgement  that  any  such  noncompliance 
was  material.  The  District  will  continue  to  analyze  and  evaluate  its  compliance  with  prior 
disclosure obligations to provide any required additional filings to the MSRB.  

 
In  order  to  assist  it  in  complying  with  its  disclosure  undertakings  for  its  outstanding 
bonds and the Refunding Bonds, the District has engaged Isom Advisors, A Division of Urban 
Futures, Inc., its financial advisor, to serve as its dissemination agent with respect to its each of 
its  disclosure  undertakings,  including  the  Continuing  Disclosure  Certificate  to  be  executed  in 
connection with the Refunding Bonds. 

ESCROW VERIFICATION 

 
Causey, Demgen & Moore (the “Verification Agent”), upon delivery of the Refunding 
Bonds, will deliver a report of the mathematical accuracy of certain computations, contained in 
schedules provided to them on behalf of the District, relating to the sufficiency of the anticipated 
amount of proceeds of the Refunding Bonds and other funds available to pay, when due, the 
principal,  whether  at  maturity  or  upon  prior  redemption,  interest  and  redemption  premium 
requirements of the Refunded Bonds. 

 
The  report  of  the  Verification  Agent  will  include  the  statement  that  the  scope  of  their 
engagement  is  limited  to  verifying  mathematical  accuracy,  of  the  computations  contained  in 
such  schedules  provided  to  them,  and  that  they  have  no  obligation  to  update  their  report 
because of events occurring, or data or information coming to their attention, subsequent to the 
date of their report. 

Standard  &  Poor’s  Ratings  Services,  a  Standard  &  Poor’s  Financial  Services  LLC 
business  (“S&P”)  is  expected  to  assign  its  rating  of  “AA”  to  the  Refunding  Bonds,  with  the 
understanding that BAM will issue the Policy with respect to the Refunding Bonds at closing. For 
an explanation of  BAM’s rating, see “BOND INSURANCE.” 

 
 In addition, S&P has assigned a rating of “A+” to the Refunding Bonds.  The District has 
provided  certain  additional  information  and  materials  to  such  rating  agencies  (some  of  which 
may not appear in this Official Statement).  Such rating reflects only the views of S&P and an 
explanation  of  the  significance  of  such  rating  and  outlook  may  be  obtained  only  from  S&P.  
There is no assurance that any credit rating given to the Refunding Bonds will be maintained for 
any period of time or that the rating may not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of a 
rating may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Refunding Bonds.  

UNDERWRITING 

 

The Refunding Bonds are being purchased by George K. Baum & Company, Inc. (the 
“Underwriter”).    The  Underwriter  has  agreed  to  purchase  the  Refunding  Bonds  at  a  price  of 
$7,268,811.80  which  is  equal  to  the  initial  principal  amount  of  the  Refunding  Bonds  of 
$7,327,431.25, less an Underwriter’s discount of $58,619.45.  The purchase contract relating to 
the Refunding Bonds provides that the Underwriter will purchase all of the Refunding Bonds (if 
any  are  purchased),  and  provides  that  the  Underwriter’s  obligation  to  purchase  is  subject  to 
certain terms and conditions, including the approval of certain legal matters by counsel.  

 
The  Underwriter  may  offer  and  sell  Refunding  Bonds  to  certain  dealers  and  others  at 
prices lower than the offering prices stated on the inside cover page hereof.  The offering prices 
may be changed by the Underwriter.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

Board of Trustees 
McKinleyville Union School District 
McKinleyville, Humboldt County, California 

Report on the Financial Statements 

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial  statements  of the  governmental  activities,  each  major 
fund, and the aggregate  remaining fund information of the McKinleyville Union School District, as of 
and  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2013,  which  collectively  comprise  the  district's  basic  financial 
statements, as listed in the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is  responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;  this includes 
the design,  implementation, and maintenance of internal control  relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,.whethel· due to fraud or 
error. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted 
our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and 
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller  General  of the United  States  of America  and  Standards  and  1?rocedures  for  Audits  of 
California K-12 Local Educational Agencies 2012-13, issued  by the Education Audit Appeals  Panel as 
regulations. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence aboutthe amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment 
of the  risks  of material  misstatement of the  financial  statements, whether due  to  fraud  or error. In 
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation 
and fair presentation ofthefinancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's 
internal  control.  Accordingly,  we  express  no  such  opinion.  An  audit  also  includes  evaluating  the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of signifi~ant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

I 

- 1 -

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinions. 

Opinions 

In our opinion, the financial  statements referred  to  above present fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the 
respective financial position ofthe governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining 
fund information of the McKinleyville School District as of June 30, 2013, and the respective changes in 
financial  position  thereof for  the year then  ended  in  conformity with  accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America. 

Other Matters 

Required Supplementary Information 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's 
discussion and analysis and budgetary comparison information on pages 4 through 13 and 43 through 44 
be presented to supplement the basic financial statements.  Such information, althougb not a part of the 
basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it 
to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate 
operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required 
supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States 
of America, which consisted ofinquiries of management about the methods of preparing the ·nformation 
and  comparing  the  information  for  consistency  with  management's  responses  to  our  inquiries,  the 
basic financial  statements, and  other knowledge we  obtained  during our audit of the  basic financial 
statements.  We do  not  express  an  opinion  or provide any  assurance on  the  information  because the 
limited  procedures  do  not  provide  us  with  sufficient  evidence  to  express  an  opinion  or provide  any 
assurance. 

Other Information 

Our audit was conducted for the purpose offorming opinions on the financial statements that collectively 
comprise  McKinleyville  School  District's  basic  financial  statements. 
The  table  of  contents 
listing  of  the  supplementary  section,  including  the  combining  and  individual  nonmajor  fund 
financial statements, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the 
basic financial statements. The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is  presented for purposes of 
additional analysis as  required  by U.s.  Office  of Management and Budget Circular A-133,  Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizatios and is  also  not a  required  part of the  basic 
financial statement as a whole. 

The supplementary section, including the combining and individual nonmajor fund financia l statements 
and the schedule of expenditures offederal awards are the responsibility of management and were derived 
from and relate directly to the underlying accoun ting and other records used to prepare the basic financial 
statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the 
basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such 
information  directly  to  the  underlying  accounting  and  other  records  used  to  prepare  the  basic 
financial  statements  or  to 
themselves,  and  other  additional 
procedures  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of 
America.  In  our opinion,  the  combining  and  individual  nonmajor fund  finalncial  statements  and  the 

the  basic  financial  statements

schedule of expenditures offederal awards are fairly stated in all material respects in relatiol11  to the basic 
financial statements as a whole. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In  accordance  with  Government  Auditing  Standards,  we  have  also  issued  our  report  dated 
December  16,  2013,  on  our  consideration  of  McKinleyville  School  District's  internal  control  over 
financial  reporting  and  on  our  tests  of its  compliance  with  certain  provisions  of laws,  regulations, 
contracts, and grant agreementst and other matters. The purpose ofthat report is to describe the scope 
of our  testing  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  compliance  and  the  results  of that 
testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That 
report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in 
considering  McKinleyville  Union  School  District's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and 
compliance.

McKinleyville Union School District

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
For Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2013

Introduction
The Management’s Discussion and Analysis section is included in the audit for the McKinleyville Union 
School District (District) as management’s view of the district’s financial condition, and provides an 
opportunity to discuss important fiscal issues with the Governing Board and the public. Accounting rules 
require this discussion and analysis. These rules make reporting of district’s finances similar to that of private 
business.

The mission of the McKinleyville Union School District, a family-centered, educational community on the 
Redwood Coast, is to develop ethical, lifelong learners living successfully in a constantly changing global 
society.  We guarantee all students challenging, progressive, academic programs, innovative learning 
experiences, technological competence and community involvement.  The District serves the residents of this 
community in Humboldt County

Using This Annual Report
This section of the District’s annual financial report presents our discussion and analysis of our financial 
performance during the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2013.  It should be read in conjunction with the 
Independent Auditor’s Report immediately proceeding and the financial statements that follow this section.  
This annual report consists of a series of financial statements.  The Statement of Net Position and Statement of 
Activities provide information about the activities of the District as a whole and present a longer-term view of 
the District’s finances.  The fund financial statements for governmental activities provide information about 
how District services were financed in the short-term, and how much remains for future spending.  Fund 
financial statements also report the District’s operations in more detail than the government-wide statements 
by providing information about the District’s most significant funds.  The remaining statements provide 
financial information about activities for which the District acts solely as a trustee or agent for the benefit of 
those outside the District.

(cid:216)

(cid:216)

(cid:216)

(cid:216)

The District’s total cash increased by $546,660 over the prior year.  This is primarily due to the 
reduction in inter-year deferrals (cash receivables for current year received in subsequent year).
Accumulated depreciation increased by $460,144.
California Basic Education Data System (CBEDS) enrollment in October 2013 was reported at 1,147
which is a gain of 14 over the prior year. 
The average daily attendance (ADA) as reported at the second period was 1086.48 with additional 9.59 
ADA for our Special Education Master Plan students that are served by Humboldt County Office of 
Education programs.  ADA for students receiving services out-of-county is received through Special 
Education CASEMIS counts like other Glen Paul students.
The District exceeds the State required minimum reserves for economic uncertainty of three percent 
(3%).  The reserve serves as a source of funds for uninsured losses, possible mid year cuts, as well as 
cash flow issues associated with deferred revenue.  This calculation is based upon the combined 
General Fund expenditures, transfers out and other uses (total outgo).  For fiscal year 2012-2013, 
expenditures and other uses totaled $8,277,647 for the General Fund.  Available reserves were 
$988,426  which is 11.94%.
The District has $14,921,129 in long-term debt due to the general obligation bonds and is outlined in 
the statements as due after one year.
The District does maintain a separate fund to provide a reserve for future retiree health benefit costs.  
The fund balance at June 30, 2013 was $355,506.

The Financial Report
The full annual financial report consists of three separate parts, including the basic financial statements, 
supplementary information, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis.  The three sections together provide 
a comprehensive overview of the District.  The basic financial statements are comprised of two kinds of 
statements that present financial information from different perspectives, government-wide and funds.

(cid:216)

(cid:216)

Government-wide financial statements, which comprise the first two statements, provide both short-
term and long-term information about the District’s overall financial position.

Individual parts of the District, which are reported as fund financial statements comprise the remaining 
statements.

v

v

Basic services funding is described in the government funds statements.  These statements 
include short-term financing and identify the balance remaining for future spending.  

Financial relationships, for which the District acts as an agent or trustee for the benefit of others 
to whom the resources belong, are presented in the fiduciary fund statements.

Notes to the financials, which are included in the financial statements, provide more detailed data and explain 
some of the information in the statements.  The required supplementary information provides further 
explanations and provides additional support for the financial statements.  A budgetary comparison of the 
District’s General Fund and major Special Reserve Funds is included.

Reporting the District as a Whole
The District as a whole is reported in the Government-wide statements and uses accounting methods similar to 
those used by companies in the private sector.  All of the District’s assets and liabilities are included in the 
Statement of Net Position.  The Statement of Activities reports all of the current year’s revenues and expenses 
regardless of when cash is received or paid.

The District’s financial health or position (net position) can be measured by the difference between the 
District’s assets and liabilities.

•

•

Increases or decreases in the net position of the District over time are indicators of whether its financial 
position is providing or deteriorating, respectively.

Additional non-financial factors such as the condition of school buildings and other facilities, and 
changes in the property tax base of the District need to be considered in assessing the overall health of 
the District.

Information included in the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities, consists solely of the 
governmental activities of the District.

Governmental Activities are the basic services provided by the District, such as regular and special education, 
administration, and transportation are included here, and are primarily financed by state apportionments, 
property taxes, impact aid, and other state and federal aid.  Non-basic services, such as child nutrition are also 
included here, but are financed by a combination of state and federal contracts, grants, and local revenues.

Reporting the District’s Most Significant Funds

The District’s fund-based financial statements provide detailed information about the District’s most 
significant funds.  Some funds are required to be established by State law, while other funds have been 
established to control and manage money for specific purposes.

Governmental Funds:

The major governmental funds of the District are the General Fund, Capital Outlay Reserve, Capital Facility 
Fund, Cafeteria Fund, and Bond Fund.   Governmental reporting focuses on how money flows into and out of 
the funds and the balances that remain at the end of the year.  A modified accrual basis of accounting measures 
cash and all other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash.  The governmental fund statements 
provide a detailed short-term view of the District’s operations and services.  Governmental fund information 
helps to determine the level of financial resources available in the near future to finance the District’s 
programs.

Fiduciary Funds:

The District is the trustee, or fiduciary, for its student activity funds.  All of the District’s fiduciary activities 
are reported in separate Fiduciary Statements.  We exclude these activities from the District’s other financial 
statements because the District cannot use these assets to finance their operations.  The District is responsible 
for ensuring that the assets reported in these funds are used for their intended purposes.

The total of all fund balances increased by $130,533 between June 2012 and June 2013.  The General Fund 
decrease was due to an increase in expenditures.  The Cafeteria Fund increase was due to an increase in 
revenue primarily as a result of increased participation in school meals. The Special Reserve increase was due 
to interest earned during the year.  The Retiree Benefit Fund decreased slightly due to expenses exceeding 
contributions. The District will increase the contribution in the future to exceed the expense. The Building 
Fund increase was due to interest earned during the year.  The Capital Facilities Fund increased due to receipt 
of Developer Fees.  The Capital Outlay Reserve Fund decrease was a result of improvements on portable 
buildings to meet code requirements.  Bond Interest and Redemption Fund increase reflects requirement of 
Measure C Bond Sales to meet annual bond repayment.

General Fund Budgetary Highlights

The District’s budget is prepared in accordance with California law and is based on the modified accrual basis 
of accounting.  Over the course of the year, the District revised its annual operating budget at various times to 
reflect the most recent financial information available.  The most significant budget adjustments made during 
the year fall into the following categories:  revisions to the adopted budget required after approval of the State 
budget and revisions to adjust program revenues and expenditures to final awards for state and federal 
categorical programs. 

Economic Factors Bearing on the District’s Future

The forecast for the State budget has improved significantly as compared to prior budget years for K-

12 Education.  As of July 1, 2013, California schools have experienced the most significant education funding 
reform within the last 40 years under the new Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). For the first time since 
the 2007-2008 school year, California closed the 2012-2013 fiscal year with a reserve of $1.1 billion. State 
revenue projections are currently higher than projections included in the Governor’s 2013-2014 Budget, which 
will result in additional funding for schools under the Prop 98 guarantee. 

Negotiations with the Classified bargaining group are settled for 2013-2014, while the District is continuing 
negotiations with the Certificated Bargaining Unit. The continued demands on the unrestricted general fund 
revenues to meet the mandates surrounding special education services must be monitored very carefully.  The 
dollars associated with providing these required services are increasing at an alarming rate.  There is the 
potential for a significant impact on the fiscal health of the District.

Enrollment is showing signs of growth with much larger than expected kindergarten enrollment of the past 
two years. The District is projecting that enrollment will remain relatively stable of the next two budget years. 

On June 3, 2008, Measure C was approved by the voters in the District.  This measure provides for a 
$14,000,000 bond issuance for capital projects.  The third phase is completed and provided improvements at 
Morris, Dow’s Prairie, and McKinleyville Middle Schools.  The McKinleyville Middle School gym is set to 
begin at the end of the 2013-2014 school year, provided the District is able to reduce the scope of the project 
through value engineering.

Interest on long-term debt in the statement of activities differs from the amount 

reported in the governmental funds because interest is recognized as an

A.  Accountin  Policies 

The McKinleyville Union School District accounts for its financial trans~ctions in accordance with 
the  policies  and  procedures  of the  Department  of Education's  Calif6rnia  School  Accounting 
Manual.  The  accounting  policies  of  the  district  conform  to  gener  lIy  accepted  accounting 
principles  as  prescribed  by  the  Governmental  Accounting  Standard  Board  (GASB)  and  the 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). 

The  district  is  the  level  of government  primarily  accountable  for  a  tivities  related  to  public 
education.  The governing authority consists of five  elected officials wh  ,together, constitute the 
Board of Trustees.

include  a  reconciliation  with  brief  explanations  to  better  identify  he  relationship  between 
the government-wide statements and the statements for the government  I funds. 

The  government-wide  statement  of  activities  presents  a  com , a rison  between  direct 
expenses  and  program  revenues  for  each  function  or  program  of  the  district's  governmental 
activities.  Direct  expenses  are  those  that  are  specifically  associated 
ith  a  service,  program, 
or  department  and  are  therefore  clearly  identifiable  to  a  particula 
function.  The  district 
does  not  allocate  indirect  expenses  to  functions  in  the  statement  of  activities.  Program 
revenues  include  charges  paid  by  the  recipients  of goods  or  service  offered  by  a  program, 
as  well  as  grants  and  contributions  that  are  restricted  to  meeting  t  e  operational  or  capital 
requirements  of  a  particular  program.  Revenues  which  are  no  classified  as  program 
revenues  are  presented  as  general  revenues  of  the  district,  with  ertain  exceptions.  The 
comparison  of  direct  expenses  with  program  revenues  identifies  t  e  extent  to  which  each 
governmental function is self-financing or draws from the general reve  ues of the district.

On  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting,  expenses  are  recognized  at  the  time  a  liability  is

items  either  when  purchased  or  during  the  benefiting  period.  T  e  district  has  chosen  to 
report  the  expenditure  when  incurred.  On  the  government-wid  statements,  the  district 
reports un-amortized debt issuance cost as prepaid expense, if mate  ·al. 

3.  Unearned Reven  e' 

Cash received for federal and state special projects and programs i  recognized as revenue to 
the  extent  that qualified  expenditures  have  been  incurred.  Unea  ned  revenue  is  recorded

Accumulated  sick  leave  benefits  are  not  recognized  as  Iiabiliti  s  of  the  district.  The 
district's  policy  is  to  record  sick  leave  as  an  operating  expense  i~ the  period  taken,  since 
such  benefits  do  not vest,  nor  is  payment  probable;  however,  unu~ed sick leave  is  added  to 
the  creditable  service  period  for  calculation  of  retirement  ben  fits  when  the  employee 
retires. 

5.  Capital Assets: 

Capital assets  are those  purchased or acquired with  an  original co  t  of $5,000  or more and 
are  reported  at historical  cost or estimated  historical  cost.  Contri  uted  assets  are  reported 
at  fa ir  market  value  as  of the  date  received.  Additions,  improve  ents,  and  other  capital 
outlays  that  significantly  extend  the  useful  life  of  an  asset  are  capitalized.  The  costs  of 
normal  maintenance  and  repairs  that  do  not  add  to  the  value  o~ the  assets  or  materially 
extend  the  assets'  lives  are  not  capitalized,  but are expensed  as  i~Furred.  Depreciation  on 
all  capital  assets  is  computed  using  a  straight-line  basis  over the  ~ 1I0wing  estimated  useful 
lives:

or  enabling  legislation.  These  are  the  same  rest  ictions  used  to  determine 
restricted net position as reported in  the governme  t-wide financial statements. 

3)  Committed Fund Balance 

The  Governing  Board,  as  the  District's  highest  level  of  decision-making 
authority, may commit fund balance for specific pur~oses pursuant to constraints 
imposed  by  formal  actions  taken,  such  a  majority  vote  or resolution.  These 
committed  amounts  cannot  be  used  for  any 
ther  purpose  unless  the 
Governing Board removes or changes the specific us  through the same type of 
formal action  taken  to establish the commitment. 
overning Board action  to 
commit fund balance needs to occur within the fisca  reporting period, no later 
than June30th; however, theamountcan bedetermi led suhsequentto the release 
of  the  financial  statements.  At  June  30,  2013,  t~e  District  does  not  have 
any reserves that meet this component of fund bala  ceo 

4) Assigned Fund Balance 

Amounts that are constrained by  the District's int  nt to  be  used  for specific 
purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed  are reported as assigned 
fund  balance.  This policy hereby delegates the aut  ority to assign amounts to 
be  used  for  specific  purposes  to  the  District Supe  intendent or Designee  for 
the purpose of reporting these amounts in the annu  I financial statements. 

5)  Unassigned Fund Balance 

These are residual positive net resources of the gen  ral fund in excess of what

The  district's  revenue  limit  is  received  from  a  combination  of local  property  taxes,  state 
apportionments, and other local sources. 

The county  is  responsible  for  assessing,  collecting,  and  apportioni  g  property  taxes.  Taxes 
are  levied  for  each  fiscal  year  on  taxable  real  and  personal  prop  rty  in  the  county.  The 
levy  is  based  on  the  assessed  values  as  of the  preceding  January  1,  which  is  also  the  lien 
date.  Property taxes  on  the secured  roll are due on  November 1 a  d  February 1,  and  taxes 
become  delinquent  after  December  10  and  April  10,  respectively  Property  tuxes  on  the

8.  Revenue LimitlPro  er  Tax (Cont );. 

Secured  property taxes  are  recorded  as  revenue when  apportioned  in  the fiscal  year of the 
levy.  The county  apportions  secured  property  tax  revenue  in  acco  dance with  the  alternate 
method  of distribution  prescribed  by  Section  4705  of the  Californ a  Revenue  and  Taxation 
Code.  This  alternate  method  provides  for  crediting  each  applic  ble  fund  with  its  total 
secured taxes upon completion of the secured tax roll approximately October 1 of each year. 

The  County Auditor  reports  the amount  of the  district's  allocated  property  tax  revenue  to 
the California Department of Education.  Property taxes are recor  ed  as  local  revenue limit 
sources by the district. 

The  California  Department  of Education  reduces  the  district's  en  itlement  by  the  district's 
local  property tax  revenue.  The balance is  paid  from  the state Ge  eral Fund, and  is  known 
as the State Apportionment. 

The district's  base  revenue limit  is  the amount of general  purpose  ax  revenue,  per average 
daily attendance (ADA),  that the district  is  entitled to  by  law.  Thi  amount is  multiplied  by 
the second period ADA to derive the district's total entitlement.

N  E 12 - OTHER PST-EMPLOYMENT B  NE  TS 

The  district  provides  post-retirement  health  care  benefits  for  employes  who  retire  between 
the  age  of  55  and  65,  with  certain  years  of  service.  On  June  30,  20P,  37  retirees  met  the 
requirements.  The  district  pays  medical  premiums  and  also  dental  and  lVision  premiums  for  all 
employees  that  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  of  the  collective  ba  gaining  agreements  or 
employment  contracts.  If  the  premiums  exceed  certain  limits,  the  ret rees  are  liable  for  the 
difference. The benefits are paid for a period up to age 65. 

As  of  the  valuation  date,  the  District  does  not  have  any  funds  eligib e  as  plan  assets  under 
GASB  45.  Under  GASB  45,  assets  cannot  be  considered  as  employee  con  ributions  or  plan  assets 
unless  they  are  segregated  for  exclusive  use  for  retiree  health  benefit  payments  and  secured 
from  creditors  of  the  District.  The  District  has  set  aside  $355,506  in  a  reserve  account  for  the 
payment of retiree benefits. 

The  District's  annual  other  post-employment  benefits  (OPEB)  cost  (expe~se)  is  calculated  based 
on  the  annual  required  contribution  of the  employer  (ARC),  an  amount  a ctuarially  determined  in 
accordance  with  the  parameters  of  GASB  Statement  45.  The  ARC  reprt:sents  a  level  of  funding 
that,  if paid  on  an  ongoing  basis,  is  projected  to  cover  normal  cost  each  year  and  amortize  any 
unfunded  actuarial  liabilities  (or  funding  excess)  over  a  period  not  to  Hceed  thirty  years.  The 
following  table  shows  the  components  of  the  District's  annual  OPEB  cost  for  the  year,  the

As  of September  1,  2010,  the  most  recent  actuarial  valuation  date,  the  pi  n  was  not  funded.  The 
actuarial  accrued  liability  for  benefits  was  $1,352,307,  and  the  actuarial  alue  of assets  was  zero, 
resulting  in  an  unfunded  actuarial  accrued  liability  (VAAL)  of $1,352,3  7.  The  covered  payroll 
(annual  payroll  of active  employees  covered  by  the  Plan)  was  $5.6  mill'  n,  and  the  ratio  of the 
VAAL to the covered payroll was 24 percent. 

Actuarial  valuations  of  an  ongoing  plan  involve  estimates  of  the  value  0 
reported  amounts  and 
assumptions  about  the  probability  of  occurrence  of events  far  into  the  f  ture.  Examples  include 
assumptions  about  future  employment,  mortality,  and 
cost  trend..  Amounts 
determined  regarding  the  funded  status  of the  plan  and  the  annual  requ red  contributions  of the 
employer  are  subject  to  continual  revision  as  actual  results  are  compare I  with  past  expectations 
and  new  estimates  are  made  about  the  future.  The  schedule  of funding  progress,  shown  above, 
presents  multiyear  trend  information  about  whether  the  actuarial  v  lue  of  plan  assets 
is 
increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liabilities  or benefits.

Projections  of  benefits  for  financial  reporting  purposes  are  based  on  t  e  substantive  plan  (the 
plan  as  understood  by  the  employer  and  the  plan  members)  and  inclu I  e  the  types  of  benefits 
provided  at  the  time  of  each  valuation  and  the  historical  pattern  of  haring  of  benefit  costs 
between  the  employer  and  plan  members  to  that  point.  The  actuarial 
ethods  and  assumptions 
used  include  techniques  that  are  designed  to  reduce  the  effects  of  sort-term 
volatility  in 
actuarial  accrued  liabilities  and  the  actuarial  value  of  assets,  consist  nt  with  the  long-term 
perspective of the calculations. 

In  the  September  1,  2010  actuarial  valuation,  the  entry  age  normal  act  arial  cost  method  was 
used.  The  actuarial  assumptions  included  a  5.0  percent  investment  rat 
(net  of  administrative 
expenses),  which 
is  based  on  assumed  long-term  investment  returns  n  plan  assets  or  the 
employer's  assets,  and  an  annual  healthcare  cost  trend  rate  of 4.0  percen .  Both  rates  included  a 
3.0  percent  inflation  assumption.  The  VAAL  is  being  amortized  as  a 
level  percentage  of 
projected payroll.  The remaining amortization period at June 30, 2013, was  7 years. 

As  additional  employees  retire,  the  obligation  will

to  determine 
the  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances  for  the  p  rppose  of  expressing

internal  control. 

A  deficiency  in  internal  control  exists  when  the  design  or  operation  of  a  ontrol  does  not  allow 
management or employees,  in  the normal course of performing their assigned  unctions, to  prevent or 
detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a defic ency, or combination of 
deficiencies, in  internal control such  that there is  a  reasonable possibility that  material misstatement 
of  the  entity's  financial  statements  will  not  be  prevented,  or  detected  and  corrected  on  a  timely 
basis.  A  significant  deficiency  is  a  deficiency,  or  a  combination  of  d  ficiencies,  in 
internal 
control  that  is  less  severe  than  a  material  weakness,  yet  important  enough  to  mer't  attention  by 
those charged with governance. 

Our  consideration  of internal  control  was  for  the  limted  purpose  described  in  the  first  paragraph 
of  this  section  and  was  not  designed  to  identify  all  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  might  be 
material  deficiencies  or  significant  deficiencies.  Given  these  limitations,  during  our  audit,  we 

- 62-

did  not  identify  any  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  we  consider  to  b~  material  weaknesses, 
as defined above.  However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been id~ntified. 

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether McKinleyville Union S  hool District's financial 
statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  we  performed  tests  of  its  co  pliance  with  certain 
provisions  of  laws,  regulations,  contracts  and  grant  agreements,  noncompli  nce  with  which  could 
have  a  direct  and  material  effect  on  the  determination  of financial  stateme  t  amounts.  However, 
providing  an  opinion  on  compliance  with  those  provisions  was  not  an  objec ive  of our  audit  and, 
accordingly,  we  do  not  express  such  an  opinion.  The  results  of our  test  dis  losed  no  instances  of 
noncompliance  or  other  matters  that  are  required  to  be  reported  under  Government  Auditing 
Standards. 

Pur  ose ofthis Re  ort 

The  purpose  of  this  report  is  solely  to  describe  the  scope  of  our  testing  0 
internal  control  and 
compliance  and  the  results  of  that  testing,  and  not  to  provide  an  opinio  on  the  effectiveness 
of  the  entity's  internal  control  or  on  compliance.  This  report  is  an  inte · ral  part  of  an  audit

We  have  audited  McKinleyville  Union  School  District's  compliance  with  th 
types  of  compliance 
requirements described  in  the OMB Circular A-133  Compliance Supplement t  at could  have a  direct 
and  material  effect  on  each  of McKinleyville Union  School  District's  major fe  eral  programs  for  the

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements oflaws, regulati  ns, contracts and grants 
applicable to each of its major federal programs. 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each ofMcKinleyvill  Union School District's 
major federal programs based on our audit ofthe types of compliance requiremen s referred to above.  We 
conducted  our  audit  of  compliance  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted  in 
the  United  States  of Americaj  the  standards  applicable  to  financial  audits  co  tained  in  Government 
Auditing  Standards,  issued  by  the  Comptroller  General  of  the  United  Stat  Sj  and  OMB  Circular 
A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations. Th  se standards and OMB 
Circular  A-133  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reaso  able  assurance  about 
whether noncompliance with  the types of compliance  requirements  referred  to  above that could  have 
a  direct  and  material  effect  on  a  major  federal  program  occurre.  An  audit 
includes 
examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  about  McKinleyville  Union  School  District's  compliance 
with  those  requirements  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  consi  ered  necessary  in  the 
circumstances. 

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on complian  e for each major federal 
program.  However,  our audit does  not  provide a  legal  determination  of Mc  nleyville  Union  School 
District's compliance.

responsible  or  establishing  and 
maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  compliance  with  the  type  of  co  pliance  requirements 
referred to  above.  In  planning and  performing our audit, we  considered  Mc  nleyville Union  School 
District's internal control over compliance with  the requirements that could ha  e a direct and material 
effect  on  a  major  federal  program  to  determine  the auditing  procedures  that are  appropriate  in  the

compliance.  Accordingly,  we  do  not  express  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness 
f  McKinleyville  Union 
School District's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency  in  internal control over compliance exists when  the design  or ope  ation  of a  control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in  the normal course of pe  forming their assigned 
functions, to  prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of comp iance requirement of a 
federal  program  on  a  timely  basis.  A  material  weakness  in  internal  contro  over  compliance  is  a 
deficiency,  or  combination  of deficiencies,  in  internal  control  over -complianc  ,  such  that  there  is  a 
reasonable possihility that material noncompliance with a  type of compliance r  quirement of a federal 
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. 

A  significant  deficiency  in  internal  control  over  compliance  is  a  deficiency  or  a  combination  of 
~eficiencies, in  internal  control  over  compliance  with  a  type  of compliance  r  uirement  of a  federal 
program that is  less severe than a material weakness in  internal control over co  pliance, yet important 
enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our -consideration  of  internal  control  over  compliance  was  for  the  limi  ed  purpose  described 
in  the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficie  cies in internal control 
over compliance that might be significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses. 
e did  not identify any 
deficiencies  in  internal control over compliance that we consider to  be material weaknesses, as defined 
above.  However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose ofthis report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe  he scope of our tes!ing of 
internal l~ontrol over compliance and the results ofthat testing based on the requir  ments of OMB Circular 
A-l33.  Accordingly~ this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

STRS.  All full-time certificated employees participate in STRS, a cost-sharing, multiple-
employer  contributory  public  employee  retirement  system.    The  plan  provides  retirement  and 
disability  benefits  and  survivor  benefits  to  beneficiaries.  Benefit  provisions  are  established  by 
State  statutes,  as  legislatively  amended,  within  the  State  Teacher’s  Retirement  Law.  Each 
school district is required by statute to contribute 8.25% of eligible employee’s salaries to STRS

New  Legislation  Regarding  STRS  Contributions  Implemented  in  FY  2014-15.    In 
connection with the State’s adoption of its fiscal year 2014-15 Budget, the Governor signed into 
law  Assembly  Bill  1469  (“AB  1469”),  which  represents  a  legislative  effort  to  address  the 
unfunded  liabilities  of  the  STRS  pension  plan  (see  below  section  entitled  “State  Pension 
Trusts”).    AB  1469  addresses  the  funding  gap  by  increasing  contributions  of  plan  members, 
employers (including the District) and the State commencing in fiscal year 2014-15.  Pursuant to 
AB 1469, employer contribution rates to the STRS plan will increase over the next seven years, 
from  the  contribution  rate  of  8.25%  in  Fiscal  Year  2013-14  to  19.1%  in  Fiscal  Year  2020-21.  
Thereafter,  employer  contribution  rates  will  be  determined  by  the  STRS  board  to  reflect  the 
contribution  required  to  eliminate  unfunded  liabilities  by  June  30,  2046.    STRS  employer 
contribution rates under AB 1469 for Fiscal Years 2014-15 through 2020-21 are summarized in 
the following table.

State  Pensions  Trusts.    Both  the  PERS  and  STRS  systems  are  operated  on  a 
statewide basis.  District contribution rates to PERS can vary annually depending on changes in 
actuarial assumptions and other factors, such as liability.  Contributions to STRS can only be 
changed  legislatively.   Both  PERS  and  STRS  have  substantial  State  unfunded  actuarial 
liabilities, being $57 billion for PERS as of June 30, 2012 (the date of the last actuarial valuation 
for  PERS)  and  $73.7  billion  for  STRS  as  of  June  30,  2013  (the  date  of  the  last  actuarial 
valuation for STRS). 

 
Both  STRS  and  PERS  issue  separate  comprehensive  financial  reports  that  include 
financial  statements  and  required  supplemental  information.    Copies  of  such  reports  may  be 
obtained  from  STRS  and  PERS,  respectively,  as  follows:    (i)    STRS,  P.O.  Box  15275, 
Sacramento,  California  95851-0275;  (ii)  PERS,  P.O.  Box  942703,  Sacramento,  California 
94229-2703.  More  information  regarding  STRS  and  PERS  can  also  be  obtained  at  their 
websites, www.calstrs.com and www.calpers.ca.gov, respectively.  However, information in the 
financial reports and on the websites is not incorporated in this Official Statement by reference.

Pension Reform Act of 2013 (Assembly Bill 340).  On September 12, 2012, Governor 
Brown signed AB 340, a bill that enacted the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act 
of 2013 (“PEPRA”) and amends various sections of the California Education and Government 
Codes.  AB 340 (i) increases the retirement age for new State, school, and city and local agency 
employees  depending  on  job  function,  (ii)  caps  the  annual  PERS  and  STRS  pension  benefit 
payouts,  (iii)  addresses numerous  abuses  of  the  system,  and  (iv)  requires  State, school,  and 
certain city and local agency employees to pay at least half of the costs of their PERS pension 
benefits.    PEPRA  applies  to  all  public  employers  except  the  University  of  California,  charter 
cities and charter counties (except to the extent they contract with PERS.) 

 
The provisions of AB 340 went into effect on January 1, 2013 with respect to new State, 
school, and city and local agency employees hired on that date and after; existing employees 
who are members of employee associations, including employee associations of the District, will 
have a five-year window to negotiate compliance with AB 340 through collective bargaining.  If 
no  agreement  is  reached  by  January  1,  2018,  a  city,  public  agency  or  school  district  could 
require employees to pay a portion of the costs of PERS pension benefits. 

B-4 

 

 

 
PERS has predicted that the impact of AB 340 on employers, including the District and 
other  employers  in  the  STRS  system,  and  employees  will  vary,  based  on  each  employer’s 
current level of benefits. To the extent that the new formulas lower retirement benefits, employer 
contribution rates could decrease over time as current employees retire and employees subject 
to the new formulas make up a larger percentage of the workforce. This change would, in some 
circumstances,  result  in  a  lower  retirement  benefit  for  employees  than  they  currently  earn.  
Additionally,  PERS  has  noted  that  changes  arising  from  AB  340  could  ultimately  have  an 
adverse  impact  on  public  sector  recruitment  in  areas  that  have  historically  experienced 
recruitment challenges due to higher pay for similar jobs in the private sector. 

 
With respect to STRS, the provisions of AB 1469 effective as of July 1, 2014 effectively 

addressed the contribution requirements of STRS members, employers and the State.

Other Post-Employment Retirement Benefits  

 
GASB  45.    In  June 2004,  the  Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“GASB”) 
issued  Statement  No. 45,  Accounting  and  Financial  Reporting  by  Employers  for  Post 
Employment  Benefits  Other  Than  Pensions  (“GASB  45”).    The  pronouncement  requires 
employers providing healthcare benefits to retirees to recognize and account for the costs for 
providing these benefits on an accrual basis and provide footnote disclosure on the progress 
toward funding the benefits.  The implementation date for this pronouncement was staggered in 
three phases based upon the entity’s annual revenues, similar to the implementation for GASB 
Statement  No.  34  and  35.    GASB  45  was  effective  for  the  District  for  the  fiscal  year  ending 
June 30,  2008.    GASB  45  provides  that  school  districts  should  establish  a  reserve  fund  and 
annually transfer sufficient funds to this reserve in order to pay for retiree employment benefits 
other than pensions for the period of time agreed in union contracts.  

 
Plan  Description.    The  District  provides  post-retirement  health  care  benefits  for 
employees who retire between the age of 55 and 65, with certain years of service. At June 30, 
2013, 37 retirees met these requirements. The District pays medical premiums and dental and 
visions  premiums  for  all  employees  who  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  of  the  collective 
bargaining  agreements  or  employment  contracts.  If  the  premiums  exceed  certain  limits,  the 
retirees are responsible for the difference. The benefits are paid up to age 65. 
 

Annual  OPEB  Cost  and  Net  OPEB  Obligation.    The  District's  annual  other  post-
employment benefit (“OPEB”) cost is calculated based on the annual required contribution of 
the employer (“ARC”), an amount actuarially determined in accordance with the parameters of 
GASB  45.  GASB  45  requires  local  government  employers  who  provide  OPEB  as  part  of  the 
compensation offered to employees to recognize he expense and related liabilities and assets in 
their financial statements.   

 
The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to 

B-5 

 

cover normal cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities (“UAAL”) 
over  a  period  not  to  exceed  thirty  years.  The  following  table  shows  the  components  of  the 
District's  annual  OPEB  cost  for  the  year,  the  amount  actually  contributed  to  the  plan,  and 
changes in the School District's OPEB obligation to the Plan: 
 

Annual required contribution  
Interest on net OPEB obligation 
Annual pension cost 
Contributions made  
Increase (decrease)in net OPEB asset  
Net pension obligation beginning of year 
Net pension asset end of year 
 
Funding  Status  and  Funding  Progress.    As  of  September  1,  2010,  the  date  of  the 
most recent actuarial report, the plan was unfunded.  The UAAL for was $1,352,307 and the 
actuarial value of assets were zero.  The District has set aside $355,506 (as of June 30, 2013) 
in a reserve account for the payment of retiree benefits.

DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

 

The  information  in  this  and  other  sections  concerning  the  District's  operations  and 
operating budget is provided as supplementary information only, and it should not be inferred 
from the inclusion of this information in this Official Statement that the principal of or interest on 
the Refunding Bonds is payable from the General Fund of the District.  The Refunding Bonds 
are payable from the proceeds of an ad valorem tax required to be levied by the County in an 
amount sufficient for the payment thereof. 

Accounting Practices  

 
The  accounting  practices  of  the  District  conform  to  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles  in  accordance  with  policies  and  procedures  of  the  California  School  Accounting 
Manual.  This manual, according to Section 41010 of the California Education Code, is to be 
followed by all California school districts.   

 
District accounting is organized on the basis of funds, with each group consisting of a 
separate accounting entity.  The major fund classification is the general fund which accounts for 
all financial resources not requiring a special fund placement.  The District's fiscal year begins 
on July 1 and ends on June 30.  For more information on the District’s basis of accounting and 
fund accounting, see “APPENDIX A – Audited Financial Statements of the District for the Year 
ending June 30, 2013 – Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies” herein. 

 
The  Governmental  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“GASB”)  Statement  No.  34  “Basic 
Financial  Statements  –  and  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  –  for  State  and  Local 
Governments”  was  adopted  on  June  30,  1999.  Statement  No.  34  provides  guidelines  to 
auditors, state and local governments and special purpose governments such as school districts 
and public utilities, on new requirements for financial reporting for all governmental agencies in 
the  United  States.  The  District  implemented  Statement  No.  34  for  the  fiscal  year  2003-04 
audited financial statement. 

 

 

 

 

Financial Statements 

 
General.    The  District's  general  fund  finances  the  legally  authorized  activities  of  the 
District  for  which  restricted  funds  are  not  provided.    General  fund  revenues  are  derived  from 
such sources as State school fund apportionments, taxes, use of money and property, and aid 
from other governmental agencies.  The District's June 30, 2013 Audited Financial Statements 
were  prepared  by  May,  Abrahamsen  and  Barsanti,  McKinleyville,  California  (the  “Auditor”).   
Audited financial statements for the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, and prior 
fiscal years are on file with the District and available for public inspection at the Office of the 
Superintendent  of  the  District,  McKinleyville  Union  School  District,  2275  Central  Avenue, 
McKinleyville, CA 95519; telephone: (707) 839-1549.  See Appendix A hereto for the June 30, 
2013  Audited  Financial  Statements.    Copies  of  such  financial  statements  will  be  mailed  to 
prospective investors and their representatives upon written request to the District.  

 
The District has not requested nor did the District obtain permission from the Auditor to 
include the audited financial statements as an appendix to this Official Statement.  Accordingly, 
the Auditor has not performed any post-audit review of the financial condition or operations of 
the District.

Reserve  Levels.    The  District  has  successfully  maintained  its  reserve  for  economic 
uncertainties  above  the  State  requirement,  with  its  unrestricted  (reserved  for  economic 
uncertainties) general fund balance being 12.4% in 2012-13, and 7.2% projected for 2013-14.   
In connection with the State’s fiscal year 2014-15 Budget (Education Trailer Bill (SB 858)), the 
Education  Code  has  been  amended  to  provide  that,  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2015-16,  if  a 
district’s proposed budget includes a local reserve above the minimum recommended level, the 
governing  board  must  provide  the  information  for  review  at  the  annual  public  hearing  on  its 
proposed budget. In addition, pursuant to SB 858, a constitutional amendment will be presented 
to State voters at the November 4, 2014 general election.  The amendment establishes a rainy 
day  fund  at  the  State  level,  as  well  as  Proposition  98  reserve  to  attempt  to  minimize  large 
fluctuations from year to year in the State’s education spending.  If approved by voters, related 
legislation  will  become  effective  could  limit  the  amount  of  reserves  maintained  at  the  District 
level.    The  District  cannot  predict  how  this  legislation  will  impact  its  reserves  and  future 
spending.  See  “STATE  FUNDING  OF  EDUCATION;  RECENT  STATE  BUDGETS-  2014-15 
State Budget.” 

 
Assumptions  Used  with  Respect  to  2013-14  Budget.    Legislation  adopted  in 
connection with  the  State’s  2013-14  Budget  includes  the  implementation  of  the  Local  Control 
Funding Formula (the “LCFF”), which changes the formula by which school districts in California 
receive funding from the State.  At the time of District Budget preparation, the District included 
certain assumptions regarding funding in fiscal year 2013-14, including calculating anticipated 
revenue based on the economic recovery target attributed to the District through the LCFF. 

 
Local Control Funding Formula.  As described in more detail herein under the heading 
“STATE FUNDING OF EDUCATION; RECENT STATE BUDGETS,” the adoption of the 2013-
14  State  Budget  and  its  related  implementing  legislation  included  significant  reforms  to 
education finance in the State with the adoption of the LCFF.  Under the LCFF, the emphasis 
shifted from a State-controlled system with funding based largely on ADA and the revenue limit 
with  numerous  State-mandated  categorical  programs,  to  a  locally-controlled  system  with  a 
funding formula which attempts to better meet the needs of students, particularly those students 
which come from low-income families or are English language learners which may require more 
support for success in school, and which provides local school officials with the ability to decide 
how best to meet the needs of their students. 

 
Funding under the LCFF consists of the following: 
 
1.  Base grant equivalent to an average of $7,643 per ADA, plus  
 
2.  20% supplemental funding for English language learners, students from low-income 

families and foster youth, plus  

 
3.    A  concentration  grant  for  districts  with  enrollment  of  more  than  55%  of  English 
learners, students from low-income families and foster youth of up to 22.5% of a local education 
agency’s base grant, based on the number of such students, plus 

 
4.  An economic recovery target, to bring local agencies back to pre-recession funding 

 
The new legislation includes a “hold harmless” provision which provides that a district or 
charter school will maintain total revenue limit and categorical funding at least equal to its 2012-
13 level, unadjusted for changes in ADA, or cost of living adjustments. 

levels. 

B-10 

 

 

 
Of the District’s 1,179 enrollment in fiscal year 2013-14, 50.13% of the enrolled students 
represent  the  unduplicated  count  of  categories  for  additional  funding  under  the  LCFF.    As  a 
result, the District expects to receive the base grant funding and supplemental funding.  There 
are  many  variables  which  still  remain  to  be  finalized  with  respect  to  the  LCFF  model  of 
education  finance  and  the  District  is  unable  to  predict  at  this  time  all  of  the  impacts  that  this 
change in education funding will have on its finances. 

District Budget and Interim Financial Reporting 

 
Budgeting - Education Code Requirements.  The District is required by provisions of 
the  State  Education  Code  to  maintain  a  balanced  budget  each  year,  in  which  the  sum  of 
expenditures and the ending fund balance cannot exceed the sum of revenues and the carry-
over  fund  balance  from  the  previous  year.  The  State  Department  of  Education  imposes  a 
uniform  budgeting  and  accounting  format  for  school  districts.  The  budget  process  for  school 
districts  was  substantially  amended  by  Assembly  Bill  1200  (“AB 1200”),  which  became  State 
law on October 14, 1991. Portions of AB 1200 are summarized below. 

 
School districts must adopt a budget on or before July 1 of each year.  The budget must 
be submitted to the county superintendent within five days of adoption or by July 1, whichever 
occurs first.  A district may be on either a dual or single budget cycle.  The dual budget option 
requires  a  revised  and  readopted  budget  by  September  1  that  is  subject  to  State-mandated 
standards  and  criteria.    The  revised  budget  must  reflect  changes  in  projected  income  and 
expenses subsequent to July 1.  The single budget is only readopted if it is disapproved by the 
county office of education, or as needed.  The District is on a single budget cycle and adopts its 
budget on or before July 1.  The District adopted its 2010-11 Budget on June 29, 2010. 

 
For  both  dual  and  single  budgets  submitted  on  July  1,  the  county  superintendent  will 
examine  the  adopted  budget  for  compliance  with  the  standards  and  criteria  adopted  by  the 
State Board of Education and identify technical corrections necessary to bring the budget into 
compliance, will determine if the budget allows the district to meet its current obligations and will 
determine if the budget is consistent with a financial plan that will enable the district to meet its 
multi-year  financial  commitments.    On  or  before  August  15,  the  county  superintendent  will 
approve or disapprove the adopted budget for each school district.  Budgets will be disapproved 
if they fail the above standards.  The district board must be notified by August 15 of the county 
superintendent's  recommendations  for  revision  and  reasons  for  the  recommendations.    The 
county  superintendent  may  assign  a  fiscal  advisor  or  appoint  a  committee  to  examine  and 
comment on the superintendent's recommendations.  The committee must report its findings no 
later than August 20.  Any recommendations made by the county superintendent must be made 
available  by  the  district  for  public  inspection.    The  law  does  not  provide  for  conditional 
approvals;  budgets  must  be  either  approved  or  disapproved.    No  later  than  August  20,  the 
county superintendent must notify the Superintendent of Public Instruction of all school districts 
whose budget has been disapproved. 

 
For all dual budget options and for single and dual budget option districts whose budgets 
have  been  disapproved,  the  district  must  revise  and  readopt  its  budget  by  September  8, 
reflecting changes in projected income and expense since July 1, including responding to the 
county  superintendent's  recommendations.    The  county  superintendent  must  determine  if  the 
budget conforms with the standards and criteria applicable to final district budgets and not later 
than October 8, will approve or disapprove the revised budgets.  If the budget is disapproved, 
the county superintendent will call for the formation of a budget review committee pursuant to 

B-11 

 

 

 

Education Code Section 42127.1.  Until a district's budget is approved, the district will operate 
on the lesser of its proposed budget for the current fiscal year or the last budget adopted and 
reviewed for the prior fiscal year. 

 
Interim Certifications Regarding Ability to Meet Financial Obligations.  Under the 
provisions of AB 1200, each school district is required to file interim certifications with the county 
office of education as to its ability to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the then-
current  fiscal  year  and,  based  on  current  forecasts,  for  the  subsequent  two  fiscal  years.  The 
county  office  of  education  reviews  the  certification  and  issues  either  a  positive,  negative  or 
qualified certification. A positive certification is assigned to any school district that will meet its 
financial  obligations  for  the  current  fiscal  year  and  subsequent  two  fiscal  years.    A  negative 
certification is assigned to any school district that will be unable to meet its financial obligations 
for the remainder of the fiscal year or subsequent fiscal year. A qualified certification is assigned 
to  any  school  district  that  may  not  meet  its  financial  obligations  for  the  current  fiscal  year  or 
subsequent two fiscal years. 

 
Under California law, any school district and office of education that has a qualified or 
negative  certification  in  any  fiscal  year  may  not  issue,  in  that  fiscal  year  or  in  the  next 
succeeding fiscal year, certificates of participation, tax anticipation notes, revenue bonds or any 
other debt instruments that do not require the approval of the voters of the district, unless the 
applicable  county  superintendent  of  schools  determines  that  the  district’s  repayment  of 
indebtedness is probable. 

 
District’s  Budget  Approval/Disapproval  and  Certification  History.  The  District  has 
not  had  a  qualified  or  negative  certification  on  any  interim  budget  report  during  the  past  five 
years.  Each of their budgets have been approved during such period, and interim reports have 
received positive certifications. The District First Interim Report for 2013-14 and Second Interim 
Report for 2013-14 both were certified by the District Board as positive. 

 
Copies of the District’s budget, interim reports and certifications may be obtained upon 
request  from  the  District  Office  at  McKinleyville  Union  School  District,  2275  Central  Avenue, 
McKinleyville,  CA  95519;  telephone:  (707)  839-1549.    The  District  may  impose  charges  for 
copying, mailing and handling. 

State Funding of Education and Revenue Limitations 

 
Historically, annual State apportionments of basic and equalization aid to school districts 
for  general  purposes  have  been  computed  up  to  a  revenue  limit  per  unit  of  average  daily 
attendance (“ADA”). Such apportionments have, generally speaking, amounted to the difference 
between the District's revenue limit and the District's local property tax allocation.  Revenue limit 
calculations are adjusted annually in accordance with a number of factors designed primarily to 
provide cost of living increases and to equalize revenues among California school districts. As 
described  in  the  preceding  section  and  herein  under  the  heading  “STATE  FUNDING  OF 
EDUCATION; RECENT STATE BUDGETS,” with the implementation of the LCFF, commencing 
in fiscal year 2013-14, school districts will receive base funding based on ADA, and may also be 
entitled  to  supplemental  funding,  concentration  grants  and  funding  based  on  an  economic 
recovery target. 

 
A schedule of the District’s ADA and total revenue limit income received by the District 

during the past five fiscal years is set forth above under “Recent Enrollment Trends.”

Each of these revenue sources is described below. 
 
Revenue  Limit  Sources.    Since  fiscal  year  1973-74,  California  school  districts  have 
operated under general purpose revenue limits established by the State Legislature.  In general, 
the  revenue  limits  are  calculated  for  each  school  district  by  multiplying  (1)  the  ADA  for  such 
district by (2) a base revenue limit per unit of ADA.  The revenue limit calculations are adjusted 
annually in accordance with a number of factors designated primarily to provide cost of living 
increases and to equalize revenues among all California school districts of the same type.  

 
Funding of the District’s revenue limit is accomplished by a mix of local property taxes 
and State apportionments of basic and equalization aid.  Generally, the State apportionments 
amount to the difference between the District’s revenue limit and its local property tax revenues.  
See “STATE FUNDING OF EDUCATION; RECENT STATE BUDGETS” below. 

 
Beginning in 1978-79, Proposition 13 and its implementing legislation provided for each 
county to levy and collect all property taxes, and prescribed how levies on county-wide property 
values are to be shared with local taxing entities within each county.   

 
The principal component of local revenues is the school district’s property tax revenues, 
i.e.,  the  district’s  share  of  the  local  1%  property  tax,  received  pursuant  to  Sections  75  and 
following  and  Sections  95  and  following  of  the  California  Revenue  and  Taxation  Code.  
Education  Code  Section  42238(h)  itemizes  the  local  revenues  that  are  counted  towards  the 
base  revenue  limit  before  calculating  how  much  the  State  must  provide  in  equalization  aid.  
Historically, the more local property taxes a district received, the less State equalization aid it is 
entitled to. 

 
As  described  in  this  Official  Statement,  with  the  implementation  of  the  LCFF  in  fiscal 
year 2013-14, the amount of State funding provided to school districts will now be determined 
with  a  funding  model  which  attempts  to  better  meet  the  needs  of  students,  particularly  those 
students  which  come  from  low-income  families  or  are  English  language  learners  which  may 
require more support for success in school, and which provides local school officials with the 
ability  to  decide  how  best  to  meet  the  needs  of  their  students.  The  LCFF  affects  how  much 

B-13 

funding a district will receive, but generally not the source of such funding, being its share of 
local property taxes together with the State funding provided in the LCFF.   

 
Federal  Revenues.  The  federal  government  provides  funding  for  several  District 

programs, including special education programs. 

 
Other State Revenues. As discussed above, the District receives State apportionment 
of basic and equalization aid in an amount equal to the difference between the District's revenue 
limit  and  its  property  tax  revenues.    In  addition  to  such  apportionment  revenue,  the  District 
receives substantial other State revenues. 

 
These other State revenues have historically been primarily restricted revenues funding 
items  such  as  the  Special  Education  Master  Plan,  home-to-school  transportation,  Economic 
Impact  Aid,  and  mandated  cost  reimbursements.  Funds  from  two  existing  programs-  the 
Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant and Home–to–School Transportation program- 
are treated as add–ons to the LCFF.  Districts, such as the District, that received funding from 
these programs in 2012–13 will continue to receive that same amount of funding in addition to 
what the LCFF provides each year.  With the implementation of the LCFF, school districts will 
have more control of how additional State revenues are allocated. 
 

The  District  receives  State  aid  from  the  California  State  Lottery  (the  "Lottery"),  which 
was  established  by  a  constitutional  amendment  approved  in  the  November  1984  general 
election. Lottery revenues must be used for the education of students and cannot be used for 
non-instructional  purposes  such  as  real  property  acquisition,  facility  construction,  or  the 
financing  of  research.  Moreover,  State  Proposition  20  approved  in  March  2000  requires  that 
50%  of  the  increase  in  lottery  revenues  over  1997-98  levels  must  be  restricted  to  use  on 
instructional materials. Lottery revenues generally comprise approximately 2% of general fund 
revenues. 

 
Other  Local  Revenues.  In  addition  to  property  taxes,  the  District  receives  additional 
local  revenues  from  items  such  as  interest  earnings,  leases  and  rentals,  and  other  local 
sources.  
 
Existing Debt Obligations 

 
General Obligation Bonds.  The District has previously issued general obligation bonds 
pursuant to its 2008 Authorization as described under the heading “THE REFINANCING PLAN.”  
General obligation bonds and refunding general obligation bonds have been issued pursuant to 
this  authorization,  as  summarized  herein  under  “DEBT  SERVICE  SCHEDULES”  and  in  the 
District’s  Audited  Financial  Statement  for  year  Ended  June  30,  2013,  attached  hereto  as 
Appendix A, Note 10. 

 

 

 

Investment of District Funds 

 
In  accordance  with  Government  Code  Section  53600  et  seq.,  the  Humboldt  County 
Treasurer  manages  funds  deposited  with  it  by  the  District.    The  County  is  required  to  invest 
such funds in accordance with California Government Code Sections 53601 et seq.  In addition, 
counties are required to establish their own investment policies which may impose limitations 
beyond those required by the Government Code.

Effect of State Budget on Revenues  

 
Public school districts in California are dependent on revenues from the State for a large 
portion of their operating budgets.  California school districts generally receive the majority of 
their operating revenues from various State sources.  The primary source of funding for school 
districts is the revenue limit, which is a combination of State funds and local property taxes (see 
“—State Funding of Education and Revenue Limitations” above).  State funds typically make up 
the majority of a district’s revenue limit.  School districts also receive substantial funding from 
the State for various categorical programs.   

 
The  availability  of  State  funds  for  public  education  is  a  function  of  constitutional 
provisions  affecting  school  district  revenues  and  expenditures  (see  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND 
STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND APPROPRIATIONS”), the condition of the State 
economy (which affects total revenue available to the State general fund), and the annual State 
budget process.

STATE FUNDING OF EDUCATION; RECENT STATE BUDGETS 

 
State Funding of Education 

 

 

 
General.  The State requires that from all State revenues there first shall be set apart 
the moneys to be applied for support of the public school system and public institutions of higher 
education.  Public school districts in California are dependent on revenues from the State for a 
large portion of their operating budgets.  California school districts receive an average of about 
55  percent  of  their  operating  revenues  from  various  State  sources.    The  primary  source  of 
funding for school districts is the revenue limit, which is a combination of State funds and local 
property  taxes  (see  “–  State  Funding  of  Education  –  Revenue  Limits”  above).    State  funds 
typically make up the majority of a district’s revenue limit.   

 
The  availability  of  State  funds  for  public  education  is  a  function  of  constitutional 
provisions  affecting  school  district  revenues  and  expenditures  (see  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND 
STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT  REVENUES  AND  APPROPRIATIONS” 
below), the condition of the State economy (which affects total revenue available to the State 
general  fund),  and  the  annual  State  budget  process.    Decreases  in  State  revenues  may 
significantly affect appropriations made by the legislature to school districts. 

 
The following information concerning the State’s budgets for the current and most recent 
preceding years has been compiled from publicly-available information provided by the State.  
Neither the District, the County, nor the Underwriter are responsible for the information relating 
to the State’s budgets provided in this section.  Further information is available from the Public 
Finance Division of the State Treasurer’s Office. 

 
The Budget Process. The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30.  
The annual budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal 
year  (the  “Governor’s  Budget”).    Under  State  law,  the  annual  proposed  Governor’s  Budget 
cannot  provide  for  projected  expenditures  in  excess  of  projected  revenues  and  balances 
available  from  prior  fiscal  years.    Following  the  submission  of  the  Governor’s  Budget,  the 
Legislature takes up the proposal. 

 
Under the State Constitution, money may be drawn from the State Treasury only through 
an appropriation made by law.  The primary source of the annual expenditure authorizations is 
the Budget Act as approved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor.  The Budget Act 
must  be  approved  by  a  majority  vote  of  each  House  of  the  Legislature.    The  Governor  may 
reduce or eliminate specific line items in the Budget Act or any other appropriations bill without 
vetoing the entire bill.  Such individual line-item vetoes are subject to override by a two-thirds 
majority vote of each House of the Legislature. 

 
Appropriations  also  may  be  included  in  legislation  other  than  the  Budget  Act.    Bills 
containing appropriations (including for K-14 education) must be approved by a majority vote in 
each House of the Legislature, unless such appropriations require tax increases, in which case 
they must be approved by a two-thirds vote of each House of the Legislature, and be signed by 
the  Governor.  Continuing  appropriations,  available  without  regard  to  fiscal  year,  may  also  be 
provided by statute or the State Constitution. 

 
Funds necessary to meet an appropriation need not be in the State Treasury at the time 

such appropriation is enacted; revenues may be appropriated in anticipation of their receipt.

Area – Budget (State)”. 

 
Prior Years’ Budgeting Techniques.  Declining revenues and fiscal difficulties which 
arose in the State commencing in fiscal year 2008-09 led the State to undertake a number of 
budgeting strategies, which had subsequent impacts on local agencies within the State.  These 
techniques included the issuance of IOUs in lieu of warrants (checks), the enactment of statutes 
deferring amounts owed to public schools, until a later date in the fiscal year, or even into the 
following fiscal year (known as statutory deferrals), trigger reductions, which were budget cutting 
measures which were implemented or could have been implemented if certain State budgeting 
goals were not met, among others, and the dissolution of local redevelopment agencies in part 
to  make  available  additional  funding  for  local  agencies.    Although  the  fiscal  year  2013-14 
Budget  is  balanced  and  projects  a  balanced  budget  for  the  foreseeable  future,  largely 
attributable to the additional revenues generated due to the passage of Proposition 30 at the 
November  8,  2011  election,  as  well  as  other  spending  cuts,  there  can  be  no  certainty  that 
budget-cutting strategies such as those used in recent years will not be used in the future and if 
projections included in the budget do not materialize. 

 
Local Control Funding Formula. The 2013-14 State Budget contained the new LCFF, 
which changed the State funding system for school districts, charter schools and county offices 

B-17 

 

of  education  to  address  inequities  in  the  distribution  of  education  funding,  by,  among  other 
changes, consolidating most categorical programs with existing revenue limit structure to a new 
student  formula  phased  in  over  seven  years,  implementing  supplemental  and  concentration 
grants  to  English  learners  and  economically  disadvantaged  students.  The  LCFF  consists  of 
base,  supplemental  and  concentration 
funding  based  on  a  school  district’s  student 
demographics: 

 
  A base grant for each local education agency equivalent to $7,643 per unit of A.D.A. 
This  base  grant  is  $2,375  more  than  the  average  revenue  limit  provided  prior  to 
LCFF implementation. The actual amount of the base grant varies based on a school 
district’s grade span: 

-  An  adjustment  of  10.4%  on  the  base  grant  amount  for  K  through  3.  As  a 
condition  of  funding,  the  district  shall  progress  toward  an  average  class 
enrollment of no more than 24 pupils in K-3, unless the district has collectively 
bargained an annual alternative class size in those grades. 
- An adjustment of 2.6% on the base grant for grades 9-12. 

 
  A 20% (of the adjusted base grant) supplemental grant for English learners, students 
from low-income families and foster youth (“Targeted Students”) to reflect increased 
costs associated with educating these students. 
 

  An  additional  concentration  grant  equal  to  50%  of  the  adjusted  base  grant  when 

Targeted Students exceed 55% of a district’s enrollment. 
 

  An  economic  recovery  target  to  ensure  that  almost  every  local  education  agency 
receives  at  least  their  pre-recession  funding  level,  adjusted  for  inflation,  at  full 
implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula. 

 
The target LCFF amounts for State school districts and charter schools based on grade 

levels and Targeted Students is shown below. 

Grade Span Funding at Full LCFF Implementation (Target Amount) 

 
Accountability under the LCFF.  The LCFF moves from a State(cid:31)controlled system that 
emphasized inputs (largely in the form of categorical funding which required funds to be spent 
on specific projects and programs) to a locally(cid:31)controlled system in which local agencies decide 
the best way to spend funds, focused instead on improved outcomes. Local school districts will 
decide  the  best  way  to  target  funds,  but  will  be  required  to  increase  or  improve  services  for 
Targeted Students in proportion to the supplemental grant funding received. In addition, as part 
of  the  LCFF,  school  districts,  county  offices  of  education  and  charter  schools  are  required  to

2014-15 State Budget 

 
On  June  20,  2014,  Governor  Brown  approved  the  2014-15  Budget  Act  (the  “2014-15 
Budget”), projecting $108 billion in general fund revenues, which is $7.3 million more in general 
fund revenues than in fiscal year 2013-14. The 2014-15 Budget is balanced and projects paying 
down  more  than  $10  billion  in  unprecedented  amounts  of  budgetary  debt  from  past  years, 
including  paying  down  deferral  of  payments  to  schools  by  $5  billion,  paying  off  Economic 
Recovery  Bonds,  repaying  various  special  fund  loans,  and  funding  $100  million  in  mandate 
claims that have been owed to local governments since 2004. The budgetary deficit is projected 
to be reduced to below $5 billion by the end of 2016-17. The fiscal year begins with a 2014-15 
State  Budget  reserve  of  $2  billion  dollars,  including  $1.6  billion  in  the  State’s  Budget 
Stabilization Account, also known as the State’s rainy day fund.  Temporary revenues provided 
by the passage of Proposition 30 (Sales and Income Tax Revenue Increase approved by State 
voters at an election held on November 8, 2011) and spending cuts have allowed for continued 
economic  growth  in  the  State.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  also  contains  triggers  allowing  for 
additional spending, if various revenue benchmarks are exceeded. If revenues surpass certain 
estimates, then the Budget calls for more funds to be applied to higher education and to pay 
down debt. Certain highlights of the 2014-15 Budget are described below. 

 
Plan  for  Reducing  STRS  Unfunded  Liability.    The  California  State  Teachers’ 
Retirement System (“STRS”) has funded significant unfunded liability. Without changes to how 
the system is funded, STRS is expected to run out of money in about 33 years. To prevent this, 
the 2014-15 Budget sets forth a plan that shares responsibility among the school districts, the 
state, and teachers to better fund STRS. Contributions for the first year from all three of these 
sources will total $275 million. Contributions will increase in subsequent years, reaching more 
than $5 billion annually. This plan is projected to eliminate unfunded liability by 2046.  

 
Constitutional Amendment on November, 2014 Ballot:  Rainy Day Fund.  The 2014-
15  State  Budget  includes  a  proposed  constitutional  amendment  which  will  be  placed  before 
State voters in November, 2014.  The measure, upon approval, would alter the State’s existing 
requirements  for  the  Budget  Stabilization  Account,  the  State’s  existing  rainy  day  account.    If 
approved, this amendment would:  

  Require deposits into the Rainy Day Fund whenever capital gains revenues rise 
to  more  than  8  percent  of  General  Fund  tax  revenues,  and  would  set  the 

B-19 

 

maximum  size  of  the  Rainy  Day  Fund  at  10  percent  of  the  General  Fund 
revenues.  
 

  Require  half  of  each  year’s  deposit  for  the  next  15  years  be  used  for 

supplemental payments of debt or other long-term liabilities. 
 

  Allow  for  withdrawal  of  funds  only  for  a  disaster  or  if  spending  remains  at  or 
below  the  highest  level  of  spending  from  the  past  three  years.  The  maximum 
amount that could be withdrawn in the first year of a recession would be limited 
to half of the Rainy Day Fund’s balance. 
 

  Require that the state provide a multiyear budget forecast to better manage the 

state’s long-term finances. 
 

  Create  a  Proposition  98  reserve,  known  as  the  Public  School  System 
Stabilization Account, where spikes in funding would be saved for future years. 
This  is  intended  to  smooth  school  spending  and  minimize  future  cuts  to 
education funding.  

 
The Education Budget Trailer Bill (SB 858) amends Education Code section 42127 to 
provide that, beginning in 2015-16, if a district’s proposed budget includes a local reserve above 
the minimum recommended level, its governing board must provide the following information for 
review at the annual public hearing on its proposed budget: 

 
The minimum recommended reserve adopted by the State Board of Education; 
The district’s fund balance in excess of the recommended reserve; and 
A statement substantiating the need for the excess reserve level. 
 
This  information  is  to  be  included  in  a  district’s  budgetary  submission  to  its  county 
superintendent, and the county superintendent must verify that each district has complied with 
these  requirements.  Budgets  prepared  by  county  superintendents  must  also  comply  with  the 
above  requirements.  This  provision  is  not  contingent  on  the  voters  approving  the  “rainy  day 
fund”  in  November,  discussed  in  the  following  sentence.  If  approved  in  November,  additional 
legislation will become effective which could limit the amount school districts may maintain in 
reserves.  Specifically, the legislation provides that this bill would, in a fiscal year immediately 
after which a transfer is made into the Public School System Stabilization Account, which would 
be  created  by  an  Assembly  Constitutional  Amendment,  prohibit  a  school  district’s  adopted  or 
revised budget from containing a combined assigned or unassigned ending fund balance that is 
in  excess  of  either  two  or  three  times  the  minimum  recommended  reserve  for  economic 
uncertainties,  as  established  by  the  state  board,  depending  on  the  school  district’s  units  of 
average  daily  attendance.  The  bill  would  authorize  the  county  superintendent  of  schools  to 
waive  the  prohibition,  pursuant  to  specified  conditions,  for  up  to  two  consecutive  fiscal  years 
within  a  three-year  period  if  the  school  district  provides  documentation  indicating  that 
extraordinary fiscal circumstances substantiates the need for the balance. The bill would make 
operation  of  these  provisions  contingent  on  the  voter  approval  of  a  specified  Assembly 
Constitutional Amendment at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election.” 

 
K - 12 Budget Adjustments. The 2014-15 State Budget includes total funding of $76.6 
billion  ($45.3  billion  General  Fund  and  $31.3  billion  other  funds)  for  all  K-12  education 
programs.  Prop.  98  funding  has  contributed  $10  billion  to  the  total  funding  amount  and  the 

B-20 

 

 

2014-15 State Budget provides $1,954 more per K-12 student in 2014-15 than was provided in 
2011-12.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  also  provides  $4.7  billion  for  the  second  year  of 
implementing the LCFF and continues to commit most new funding to districts serving English 
language learners, students from low-income families, and youth in foster care. The Education 
Budget Trailer Bill (“SB 858”) is included in the 2014-15 State Budget and contains two separate 
provisions that have the potential to affect district reserve funds.  In addition, the 2014-15 State 
Budget includes the following:  

to 

the  LCFF.  This 

  Local Control Funding Formula. The 2014-15 State Budget contains an increase 
of  $4.75  billion  in  the  Proposition  98  General  Fund  to  continue  the  State’s 
transition 
funding 
implementation  gap  by  more  than  29  percent.  Additionally,  the  2014-15  State 
Budget addresses an administrative problem related to the collection of income 
eligibility forms that are used to determine student eligibility for free or reduced-
price meals.  
 

increase  will  close 

the  remaining 

 

  K-12 Deferrals. The 2014-15 State Budget repays nearly $4.7 billion Proposition 
98 General Fund for K-12 expenses that had been deferred from one year to the 
next during the past few years. This repayment will leave an outstanding balance 
of  less  than  $900  million  in  K-12  deferrals.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  also 
contains  a  trigger  mechanism  that  will  appropriate  any  additional  funding 
resources attributable to the 2013-14 and 2014-15 fiscal years subsequent to the 
enactment of the 2014-15 State Budget for the purpose of retiring the remaining 
$900 million in K-12 deferrals.  
 
Independent  Study.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  reduces  administrative  burdens 
and  frees  up  time  for  teachers  to  spend  on  student  instruction  and  support, 
making  it  easier  for  schools  to  offer  and  expand  instructional  opportunities 
available to students through non-classroom based instruction.  
 

  K-12 Mandates. The 2014-15 State Budget provides $400.5 million in one-time 
Proposition  98  General  Fund  to  reimburse  K-12  local  educational  agencies  for 
the costs of state-mandated programs. These funds will make a significant down 
payment  on  outstanding  mandate  debt,  while  providing  school  districts,  county 
offices of education, and charter schools with discretionary resources to support 
critical investments such as Common Core implementation.  
 

  K-12 High-Speed Internet Access. The 2014-15 State Budget increases the one-
time  Proposition  98  General  Fund  for  the  K-12  High  Speed  Network  by  $26.7 
million. This Fund provides technical assistance and grants to local educational 
agencies to address the technology requirements necessary for Common Core 
implementation.  
 

  Career  Technical  Education  Pathways  Program.  The  2014-15  State  Budget 
increases by $250 million the one-time Proposition 98 General Fund to support a 
second  cohort  of  competitive  grants  for  participating  K-12  local  educational 
agencies.  Established  in  the  2013  Budget  Act,  the  Career  Pathways  Trust 
Program  provides  grant  awards  to  improve  career  technical  programs  and 
linkages between employers, schools and community colleges.

Higher Education and Healthcare. The 2014-15 State Budget includes total funding of 
$26.2 billion ($14.7 billion General Fund and local property tax and $11.5 billion other funds). It 
also provides for up to a 20 percent increase in General Fund appropriations over a four-year 
period.  The  2014-15  Budget  includes  a  5  percent  increase  in  2014-15  for  each  university 
system,  which  equals  $284  million  total.  Regarding  healthcare,  the  state’s  adoption  of  the 
optional  expansion  of  Medi-Cal  under  federal  law  known  as  the  Affordable  Care  Act  created 
major  new  spending  commitments.  The  2014-15  Budget  assumes  an  additional  Medi-Cal 
caseload of 2.5 million individuals and a rise in costs of $2.4 billion over fiscal year 2012-13.   

 
Emergency Drought Response. On January 17, 2014, Governor Brown proclaimed a 
state  of  emergency  due  to  the  severe  drought  conditions  faced  by  the  state.  Legislation  was 
enacted  in  February  which  provided  $687.4  million  to  support  drought  relief.  The  2014-15 
Budget  includes  additional  one-time  resources  to  continue  immediate  drought-related  efforts 
started  in  2014,  such  as  an  increase  of  $53.8  million  General  Fund  and  $12.2  million  other 
funds for firefighting efforts, and an increase of $18.1 million General Fund to aid in assessing 
water conditions and provide public outreach regarding water conservation.   

 
Numerous Factors Affecting Budget and Projections. The execution of the 2014-15 
State Budget may be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to: (i) shifts of costs 
from  the  federal  government  to  the  State,  (ii)  national,  State  and  international  economic 
conditions,  (iii)  litigation  risk  associated  with  spending  reductions,  including  the  elimination  of 
redevelopment  agencies,  (iv)  rising  health  care  costs  (v)  large  unfunded  liabilities  for  retired 
State  employee’s  pensions  and  healthcare,  (vi)  deferred  maintenance  of  State’s  critical 
infrastructure and (vii) other factors, all or any of which could cause the revenue and spending 
projections made in 2014-15 State Budget  to be unattainable. The District cannot predict the 
impact that the 2014-15 State Budget, or subsequent budgets, will have on its own finances and 
operations.  Additionally, the District cannot predict the accuracy of any projections made in the 
State’s 2014-15 State Budget.  

 
The  complete  2014-15  State  Budget  is  available  from  the  California  Department  of 
Finance  website  at  www.dof.ca.gov.    The  District  can  take  no  responsibility  for  the  continued 
accuracy of this internet address or for the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of information 
posted  there,  and  such  information  is  not  incorporated  in  this  Official  Statement  by  such 
reference. The information referred to above should not be relied upon in making an investment 
decision with respect to the Bonds 

Uncertainty Regarding Future State Budgets 
 

The  District  cannot  predict  what  actions  will  be  taken  in  future  years  by  the  State 
Legislature and the Governor to address the State’s current or future budget deficits.  Future 
State budgets will be affected by national and state economic conditions and other factors over 
which  the  District  has  no  control.    The  District  cannot  predict  what  impact  any  future  budget 
proposals will have on the financial condition of the District.  To the extent that the State budget 
process  results  in  reduced  revenues  to  the  District,  the  District  will  be  required  to  make 
adjustments to its budgets.  

 
The State has not entered into any contractual commitment with the District, the County, 
or the Owners of the Refunding Bonds to provide State budget information to the District or the 
owners of the Refunding Bonds.  Although they believe the State sources of information listed 
above  are  reliable,  neither  the  District  nor  the  Underwriter  assumes  any  responsibility  for  the 
accuracy  of  the  State  Budget  information  set  forth  or  referred  to  in  this  Official  Statement  or 

B-22 

incorporated  herein.  However,  the  Refunding  Bonds  are  secured  by  ad  valorem  taxes  levied 
and collected on taxable property in the District, without limit as to rate or amount, and are not 
secured by a pledge of revenues of the District or its general fund. 

Legal Challenges to State Funding of Education 

 
The application of Proposition 98 and other statutory regulations has been the subject of 
various legal challenges in recent years, and is likely to be further challenged in the future.  For 
a discussion of how the provisions of Proposition 98 have been applied to school funding see “- 
State Funding of Education" and "-Recent State Budgets” above.

CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING 

DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS 

 
Principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds are payable from the proceeds of an ad 
valorem tax levied by the County for the payment thereof.  Articles XIIIA, XIIIB, XIIIC, and XIIID 
of the State Constitution, Propositions 62, 98, 111, 187 and 218, and certain other provisions of 
law  discussed  below,  are  included  in  this  section  to  describe  the  potential  effect  of  these 
Constitutional and statutory measures on the ability of the District to levy taxes and spend tax 
proceeds for operating and other purposes, and it should not be inferred from the inclusion of 
such materials that these laws impose any limitation on the ability of the District to levy taxes for 
payment of the Refunding Bonds.  The tax levied by the County for payment of the Refunding 
Bonds was approved by the District's voters in compliance with Article XIIIA and all applicable 
laws. 

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution 
 

Basic Property Tax Levy.  On June 6, 1978, California voters approved Proposition 13 
("Proposition 13"), which added Article XIIIA to the State Constitution ("Article XIIIA").  Article 
XIIIA  limits  the  amount  of  any  ad  valorem  tax  on  real  property  to  1%  of  the  full  cash  value 
thereof,  except  that  additional  ad  valorem  taxes  may  be  levied  to  pay  debt  service  on  (i) 
indebtedness approved by the voters prior to July 1, 1978, (ii) (as a result of an amendment to 
Article  XIIIA  approved  by  State  voters  on  June  3,  1986)  on  bonded  indebtedness  for  the 
acquisition or improvement of real property which has been approved on or after July 1, 1978 by 
two-thirds of the voters on such indebtedness (which provided the authority for the issuance of 
the Refunded Bonds), and (iii) (as a result of an amendment to Article XIIIA approved by State 
voters on November 7, 2000) bonded indebtedness incurred by a school district or community 
college  district  for  the  construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation  or  replacement  of  school 
facilities or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities, approved by 55% of the 
voters of the district, but only if certain accountability measures are included in the proposition. 
Article XIIIA defines full cash value to mean "the county assessor’s valuation of real property as 
shown on the 1975-76 tax bill under full cash value, or thereafter, the appraised value of real 
property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership have occurred after the 
1975 assessment".  This full cash value may be increased at a rate not to exceed 2% per year 
to account for inflation. 

 
Article XIIIA has subsequently been amended to permit reduction of the "full cash value" 
base in the event of declining property values caused by damage, destruction or other factors, 
to  provide  that  there  would  be  no  increase  in  the  "full  cash  value"  base  in  the  event  of 
reconstruction of property damaged or destroyed in a disaster and in other minor or technical 
ways. 

 
Both  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  and  the  California  State  Supreme  Court  have 

upheld the general validity of Article XIIIA. 

 
Legislation Implementing Article XIIIA. Legislation has been enacted and amended a 
number of times since 1978 to implement Article XIIIA.  Under current law, local agencies are no 
longer permitted to levy directly any property tax (except to pay voter-approved indebtedness).  
The 1% property tax is automatically levied by the county and distributed according to a formula 
among  taxing  agencies.    The  formula  apportions  the  tax  roughly  in  proportion  to  the  relative 
shares of taxes levied prior to 1979. 

 

 

 

B-24 

Increases  of  assessed  valuation  resulting  from  reappraisals  of  property  due  to  new 
construction,  change  in  ownership  or  from  the  annual  adjustment  not  to  exceed  2%  are 
allocated among the various jurisdictions in the “taxing area” based upon their respective “situs.”  
Any such allocation made to a local agency continues as part of its allocation in future years. 

 
Inflationary Adjustment of Assessed Valuation.  As described above, the assessed 
value  of  a  property  may  be  increased  at  a  rate  not  to  exceed  2%  per  year  to  account  for 
inflation.  On December 27, 2001, the Orange County Superior Court, in County of Orange v. 
Orange County Assessment Appeals Board No. 3, held that where a home’s taxable value did 
not increase for two years, due to a flat real estate market, the Orange County assessor violated 
the 2% inflation adjustment provision of Article XIIIA, when the assessor tried to "recapture" the 
tax  value  of  the  property  by  increasing  its  assessed  value  by  4%  in  a  single  year.    The 
assessors  in  most  California  counties,  including  the  County,  use  a  similar  methodology  in 
raising  the  taxable  values  of  property  beyond  2%  in  a  single  year.    The  State  Board  of 
Equalization has approved this methodology for increasing assessed values.  On appeal, the 
Appellate Court held that the trial court erred in ruling that assessments are always limited to no 
more than 2% of the previous year’s assessment.  On May 10, 2004 a petition for review was 
filed  with  the  California  Supreme  Court.    The  petition  has  been  denied  by  the  California 
Supreme  Court.    As  a  result  of  this  litigation,  the  “recapture”  provision  described  above  may 
continue to be employed in determining the full cash value of property for property tax purposes. 

Unitary Property 

 

 

 

 

 
Some amount of property tax revenue of the District is derived from utility property which 
is  considered  part  of  a  utility  system  with  components  located  in  many  taxing  jurisdictions 
(“unitary  property”).    Under  the  State  Constitution,  such  property  is  assessed  by  the  State 
Board of Equalization (“SBE”) as part of a “going concern” rather than as individual pieces of 
real or personal property.  State-assessed unitary and certain other property is allocated to the 
counties by SBE, taxed at special county-wide rates, and the tax revenues distributed to taxing 
jurisdictions  (including  the  District)  according  to  statutory  formulae  generally  based  on  the 
distribution of taxes in the prior year. 

Constitutional Appropriations Limitation 

 
Article XIIIB  (“Article XIIIB”)  of  the  State  Constitution,  as  subsequently  amended  by 
Propositions 98 and 111, respectively, limits the annual appropriations of the State and of any 
city,  county,  school  district,  authority  or  other  political  subdivision  of  the  State  to  the  level  of 
appropriations  of  the  particular  governmental  entity  for  the  prior  fiscal  year,  as  adjusted  for 
changes in the cost of living and in population and for transfers in the financial responsibility for 
providing services and for certain declared emergencies.  For fiscal years beginning on or after 
July 1, 1990, the appropriations limit of each entity of government shall be the appropriations 
limit for the 1986-87 fiscal year adjusted for the changes made from that fiscal year under the 
provisions of Article XIIIB, as amended. 

 
The  appropriations  of  an  entity  of  local  government  subject  to  Article XIIIB  limitations 
include  the  proceeds  of  taxes  levied  by  or  for  that  entity  and  the  proceeds  of  certain  state 
subventions to that entity.  “Proceeds of taxes” include, but are not limited to, all tax revenues 
and the proceeds to the entity from (a) regulatory licenses, user charges and user fees (but only 
to  the  extent  that  these  proceeds  exceed  the  reasonable  costs  in  providing  the  regulation, 
product or service), and (b) the investment of tax revenues. 

B-25 

 

 

Appropriations subject to limitation do not include (a) refunds of taxes, (b) appropriations 
for debt service, (c) appropriations required to comply with certain mandates of the courts or the 
federal  government,  (d) appropriations  of  certain  special  districts,  (e) appropriations  for  all 
qualified  capital  outlay  projects  as  defined  by  the  legislature,  (f) appropriations  derived  from 
certain  fuel  and  vehicle  taxes  and  (g) appropriations  derived  from  certain  taxes  on  tobacco 
products. 

 
Article XIIIB  includes  a  requirement  that  all  revenues  received  by  an  entity  of 
government other than the State in a fiscal year and in the fiscal year immediately following it in 
excess  of  the  amount  permitted  to  be  appropriated  during  that  fiscal year  and  the  fiscal  year 
immediately following it shall be returned by a revision of tax rates or fee schedules within the 
next two subsequent fiscal years. 

 
Article XIIIB also includes a requirement that 50% of all revenues received by the State 
in a fiscal year and in the fiscal year immediately following it in excess of the amount permitted 
to be appropriated during that fiscal year and the fiscal year immediately following it shall be 
transferred and allocated to the State School Fund under Section 8.5 of Article XVI of the State 
Constitution.   

Article XIIIC and Article XIIID of the California Constitution 

 
On November 5, 1996, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 218, 
popularly known as the “Right to Vote on Taxes Act.”  Proposition 218 added to the California 
Constitution Articles XIIIC and XIIID (respectively, “Article XIIIC” and “Article XIIID”), which 
contain a number of provisions affecting the ability of local agencies, including school districts, 
to levy and collect both existing and future taxes, assessments, fees and charges. 

 
According  to  the  “Title  and  Summary”  of  Proposition  218  prepared  by  the  California 
Attorney General, Proposition 218 limits “the authority of local governments to impose taxes and 
property-related assessments, fees and charges.”  Among other things, Article XIIIC establishes 
that  every  tax  is  either  a  “general  tax”  (imposed  for  general  governmental  purposes)  or  a 
“special  tax”  (imposed  for  specific  purposes),  prohibits  special  purpose  government  agencies 
such  as  school  districts  from  levying  general  taxes,  and  prohibits  any  local  agency  from 
imposing, extending or increasing any special tax beyond its maximum authorized rate without a 
two-thirds  vote;  and  also  provides  that  the  initiative  power  will  not  be  limited  in  matters  of 
reducing or repealing local taxes, assessments, fees and charges.  Article XIIIC further provides 
that  no  tax  may  be  assessed  on  property  other  than  ad  valorem  property  taxes  imposed  in 
accordance with Articles XIII and XIIIA of the California Constitution and special taxes approved 
by a two-thirds vote under Article XIIIA, Section 4.   

 
On November 2, 2010, Proposition 26 was approved by State voters, which amended 
Article XIIIC to expand the definition of “tax” to include “any levy, charge, or exaction of any kind 
imposed by a local government” except the following: (1) a charge imposed for a specific benefit 
conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and 
which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit or 
granting  the  privilege;  (2)  a  charge  imposed  for  a  specific  government  service  or  product 
provided  directly  to  the  payor  that  is  not  provided  to  those  not  charged,  and  which  does  not 
exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of providing the service or product; (3) a 
charge imposed for the reasonable regulatory costs to a local government for issuing licenses 
and permits, performing investigations, inspections , and audits, enforcing agricultural marketing 
orders, and the administrative enforcement and adjudication thereof; (4) a charge imposed for 

B-26 

 

 

entrance  to  or  use  of  local  government  property,  or  the  purchase,  rental,  or  lease  of  local 
government  property;  (5)  a  fine,  penalty,  or  other  monetary  charge  imposed  by  the  judicial 
branch  of  government  or  a  local  government,  as  a  result  of  a  violation  of  law;  (6)  a  charge 
imposed  as  a  condition  of  property  development;  and  (7)  assessments  and  property-related 
fees imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article XIIID.  Proposition 26 provides that the 
local government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy, 
charge, or other exaction is not a tax, that the amount is no more than necessary to cover the 
reasonable  costs  of  the  governmental  activity,  and  that  the  manner  in  which  those  costs  are 
allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor’s burdens on, or benefits 
received from, the governmental activity. 

 
Article  XIIID  deals  with  assessments  and  property-related  fees  and  charges,  and 
explicitly provides that nothing in Article XIIIC or XIIID will be construed to affect existing laws 
relating to the imposition of fees or charges as a condition of property development. 

 
Proposition 218 does not affect the ad valorem property taxes to be levied by the County 

to pay debt service on the Refunding Bonds. 

Proposition 62 

 
A statutory initiative (“Proposition 62”) was adopted by the voters at the November 4, 
1986, general election which (a) requires that any new or higher taxes for general governmental 
purposes  imposed  by  local  governmental  entities  such  as  the  District  be  approved  by  a  two-
thirds vote of the governmental entity’s legislative body and by a majority vote of the voters of 
the  governmental  entity  voting  in  an  election  on  the  tax,  (b) requires  that  any  special  tax 
(defined  as  taxes  levied  for  other  than  general  governmental  purposes)  imposed  by  a  local 
governmental entity be approved by a two-thirds vote of the voters of the governmental entity 
voting  in  an  election  on  the  tax,  (c) restricts  the  use  of  revenues  from  a  special  tax  to  the 
purposes or for the service for which the special tax was imposed, (d) prohibits the imposition of 
ad  valorem  taxes  on  real  property  by  local  governmental  entities  except  as  permitted  by 
Article XIIIA, (e) prohibits the imposition of transaction taxes and sales taxes on the sale of real 
property  by  local  governmental  entities,  and  (f) requires  that  any  tax  imposed  by  a  local 
governmental entity on or after August 1, 1985, be ratified by a majority vote of the voters voting 
in an election on the tax within two years of the adoption of the initiative or be terminated by 
November 15, 1988. 

 
California  appellate  court  cases  have  overturned  the  provisions  of  Proposition 62 
pertaining to the imposition of taxes for general government purposes.  However, the California 
Supreme  Court  upheld  Proposition 62  in  its  decision  on  August 28,  1995,  in  Fresno  County 
Transportation  Authority v.  Guardino. 
the  constitutionality  of 
Proposition 62.  Certain matters regarding Proposition 62 were not addressed in the Supreme 
Court’s decision, such as what remedies exist for taxpayers subject to a tax not in compliance 
with  Proposition 62,  and  whether  the  decision  applies  to  charter  cities.    The  District  has  not 
experienced any substantive adverse financial impact as a result of the passage of this initiative. 

  This  decision  reaffirmed 

 

Proposition 98 
 

On November 8, 1988, California voters approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative 
constitutional  amendment  and  statute  called  the  “Classroom  Instructional  Improvement  and 
Accountability  Act”  (the  “Accountability  Act”).    Certain  provisions  of  the  Accountability  Act 
have,  however,  been  modified  by  Proposition  111,  discussed  below,  the  provisions  of  which 

B-27 

became  effective  on  July  1,  1990.    The  Accountability  Act  changes  State  funding  of  public 
education below the university level and the operation of the State’s appropriations limit.  The 
Accountability  Act  guarantees  State  funding  for  K-12  school  districts  and  community  college 
districts  (hereinafter  referred  to  collectively  as  “K-14  school  districts”)  at  a  level  equal  to  the 
greater of (a) the same percentage of general fund revenues as the percentage appropriated to 
such  districts  in  1986-87,  and  (b)  the  amount  actually  appropriated  to  such  districts  from  the 
general fund in the previous fiscal year, adjusted for increases in enrollment and changes in the 
cost of living.  The Accountability Act permits the Legislature to suspend this formula for a one-
year period. 

 
The  Accountability  Act  also  changes  how  tax  revenues  in  excess  of  the  State 
appropriations limit are distributed.  Any excess State tax revenues up to a specified amount 
would, instead of being returned to taxpayers, be transferred to K-14 school districts.  Any such 
transfer to K-14 school districts would be excluded from the appropriations limit for K-14 school 
districts and the K-14 school district appropriations limit for the next year would automatically be 
increased  by  the  amount  of  such  transfer.    These  additional  moneys  would  enter  the  base 
funding calculation for K 14 school districts for subsequent years, creating further pressure on 
other portions of the State budget, particularly if revenues decline in a year following an Article 
XIIIB surplus.  The maximum amount of excess tax revenues which could be transferred to K 14 
school  districts  is  4%  of  the  minimum  State  spending  for  education  mandated  by  the 
Accountability Act. 

Proposition 111 
 

On  June  5,  1990,  the  voters  approved  Proposition  111  (Senate  Constitutional 
Amendment  No.  1)  called  the  “Traffic  Congestion  Relief  and  Spending  Limit  Act  of  1990” 
(“Proposition 111”) which further modified Article XIIIB and Sections 8 and 8.5 of Article XVI of 
the State Constitution with respect to appropriations limitations and school funding priority and 
allocation. 

 
The most significant provisions of Proposition 111 are summarized as follows: 
 
Annual Adjustments to Spending Limit.  The annual adjustments to the Article XIIIB 
spending limit were liberalized to be more closely linked to the rate of economic growth.  Instead 
of being tied to the Consumer Price Index, the “change in the cost of living” is now measured by 
the change in California per capita personal income.  The definition of “change in population” 
specifies that a portion of the State’s spending limit is to be adjusted to reflect changes in school 
attendance. 

 
Treatment  of  Excess  Tax  Revenues.    “Excess”  tax  revenues  with  respect  to  Article 
XIIIB  are  now  determined  based  on  a  two-year  cycle,  so  that  the  State  can  avoid  having  to 
return to taxpayers excess tax revenues in one year if its appropriations in the next fiscal year 
are under its limit.  In addition, the Proposition 98 provision regarding excess tax revenues was 
modified.  After any two-year period, if there are excess State tax revenues, 50% of the excess 
are to be transferred to K-14 school districts with the balance returned to taxpayers; under prior 
law, 100% of excess State tax revenues went to K-14 school districts, but only up to a maximum 
of 4% of the schools’ minimum funding level.  Also, reversing prior law, any excess State tax 
revenues  transferred  to  K-14  school  districts  are  not  built  into  the  school  districts’  base 
expenditures  for  calculating  their  entitlement  for  State  aid  in  the  next  year,  and  the  State’s 
appropriations limit is not to be increased by this amount. 

 

 

 

B-28 

 

 

Exclusions  from  Spending  Limit.    Two  exceptions  were  added  to  the  calculation  of 
appropriations which are subject to the Article XIIIB spending limit.  First, there are excluded all 
appropriations for “qualified capital outlay projects” as defined by the Legislature.  Second, there 
are excluded any increases in gasoline taxes above the 1990 level (then nine cents per gallon), 
sales and use taxes on such increment in gasoline taxes, and increases in receipts from vehicle 
weight  fees  above  the  levels  in  effect  on  January  1,  1990.    These  latter  provisions  were 
necessary  to  make  effective  the  transportation  funding  package  approved  by  the  Legislature 
and the Governor, which expected to raise over $15 billion in additional taxes from 1990 through 
2000 to fund transportation programs. 

 
Recalculation of Appropriations Limit.  The Article XIIIB appropriations limit for each 
unit of government, including the State, is to be recalculated beginning in fiscal year 1990-91.  It 
is  based  on  the  actual  limit  for  fiscal  year  1986-87,  adjusted  forward  to    1990-91  as  if 
Proposition 111 had been in effect. 

 
School Funding Guarantee.  There is a complex adjustment in the formula enacted in 
Proposition 98 which guarantees K-14 school districts a certain amount of State general fund 
revenues.  Under prior law, K-14 school districts were guaranteed the greater of (1) 40.9% of 
State general fund revenues (the “first test”) or (2) the amount appropriated in the prior year 
adjusted for changes in the cost of living (measured as in Article XIIIB by reference to per capita 
personal  income)  and  enrollment  (the  “second  test”).    Under  Proposition  111,  schools  will 
receive the greater of (1) the first test, (2) the second test, or (3) a third test, which will replace 
the second test in any  year when  growth in  per capita State general fund revenues from the 
prior year is less than the annual growth in California per capita personal income (the “third 
test”).    Under  the  third  test,  schools  will  receive  the  amount  appropriated  in  the  prior  year 
adjusted  for  change  in  enrollment  and  per  capita  State  general  fund  revenues,  plus  an 
additional small adjustment factor.  If the third test is used in any year, the difference between 
the third test and the second test will become a “credit” to schools which will be paid in future 
years when State general fund revenue growth exceeds personal income growth. 

Proposition 1A and Proposition 22 

 
On November 2, 2004, California voters approved Proposition 1A, which amended the 
State  constitution  to  significantly  reduce  the  State's  authority  over  major  local  government 
revenue sources.  Under  Proposition 1A, the State cannot (i) reduce local sales tax rates or  
alter the method of allocating the revenue generated by such taxes,  (ii) shift property taxes from 
local governments to schools or community colleges, (iii) change how property tax revenues are 
shared  among  local  governments  without  two-thirds  approval  of  both  houses  of  the  State 
Legislature or (iv) decrease Vehicle License Fee revenues without providing local governments 
with equal replacement funding.  Under Proposition 1A, beginning, in 2008-09, the State may 
shift  to  schools  and  community  colleges  a  limited  amount  of  local  government  property  tax 
revenue if certain conditions are met, including: (i) a proclamation by the  Governor that the shift 
is needed due to a severe financial hardship  of the State, and (ii) approval of the shift by the 
State  Legislature  with  a  two-thirds  vote  of  both  houses.    Under  such  a  shift,  the  State  must 
repay  local  governments  for  their  property  tax  losses,  with  interest,  within  three  years.  
Proposition  1A  does  allow  the  State  to  approve  voluntary    exchanges  of  local  sales  tax  and 
property tax revenues among local governments within a county.  Proposition 1A also amended 
the State Constitution to require the State to suspend certain State laws creating mandates in 
any year that the State does not fully reimburse local governments for their costs to comply with 
the  mandates.    This  provision  does  not  apply  to  mandates  relating  to  schools  or  community 
colleges or to those mandates relating to employee rights. 

B-29 

 

 

 

 
Proposition 22, a constitutional initiative entitled the “Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and 
Transportation Protection Act of 2010,” approved on November 2, 2010, superseded many of 
the  provision  of  Proposition  1A.    This  initiative  amends  the  State  constitution  to  prohibit  the 
legislature from diverting or shifting revenues that are dedicated to funding services provided by 
local  government  or  funds  dedicated  to  transportation  improvement  projects  and  services.  
Under this proposition, the State is not allowed to take revenue derived from locally imposed 
taxes, such as hotel taxes, parcel taxes, utility taxes and sales taxes, and local public transit 
and transportation funds.  Further, in the event that a local governmental agency sues the State 
alleging a violation of these provisions and wins, then the State must automatically appropriate 
the funds needed to pay that local government.  This Proposition was intended to, among other 
things, stabilize local government revenue sources by restricting the State’s control over local 
property taxes.  Proposition 22 did not prevent the California State Legislature from dissolving 
State  redevelopment  agencies  pursuant  to  AB  1X26,  as  confirmed  by  the  decision  of  the 
California  Supreme  Court  decision  in  California  Redevelopment  Association  v.  Matosantos 
(2011).  
 
Because  Proposition  22  reduces  the  State’s  authority  to  use  or  reallocate  certain 
revenue sources, fees and taxes for State general fund purposes, the State will have to take 
other actions to balance its budget, such as reducing State spending or increasing State taxes, 
and school and college districts that receive Proposition 98 or other funding from the State will 
be more directly dependent upon the State’s general fund. 

Application of Constitutional and Statutory Provisions; Recent Lawsuit 

 
The  application  of  Proposition  98  and  other  statutory  regulations  has  become 
increasingly difficult to predict accurately in recent years. For a discussion of how the provisions 
of  Proposition  98  have  been  applied 
funding  see  “DISTRICT  FINANCIAL 
INFORMATION - State Funding of Education and Recent State Budgets.”  In addition, a lawsuit 
is pending against the State with respect to the existing system of public school finance.  See 
“DISTRICT  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION    -  2010  Legal  Challenge  to  State  Funding  of 
Education.”

Future Initiatives 
 

Article XIIIA, Article XIIIB, Article XIIIC and Article XIIID of the California Constitution and 
Propositions 98, 111 and 22 were each adopted as measures that qualified for the ballot under 
the  State’s  initiative  process.    From  time  to  time  other  initiative  measures  could  be  adopted 
further affecting District revenues or the District’s ability to expend revenues.  The nature and 
impact of these measures cannot be anticipated by the District.

ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FOR  

HUMBOLDT COUNTY 

 
The  Refunding  Bonds  are  not  a  debt  of  the  County  of  Humboldt.    The  County  of 
Humboldt, including its Board of Supervisors, officers, officials, agents and other employees, are 
required, only to the extent required by law, to: (i) levy and collect ad valorem taxes for payment 
of the Refunding Bonds in accordance with the law; and (ii) transmit the proceeds of such taxes 
to the paying agent for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds at 
the time such payment is due. 
 
General 
 
Humboldt County was created from the western portion of Trinity County in 1853. The 
County’s name is derived from Humboldt Bay. Originally discovered in 1806 by a hunting party, 
the bay was not rediscovered until 1849 and then named in honor of the naturalist and explorer 
Baron  Alexander  Von  Humboldt.  Humboldt  County’s  3,600  square  miles  are  known  for  their 
rural beauty, roughly 80% of which is designated recreation areas and timber land. The County 
is home to the biggest and oldest redwood trees in the world. Natural resources also make the 
County  a  primary  tourist  destination.  Popular  sites  include:  Six  Rivers  National  Forest,  King 
Range National Conservation Area, Humboldt Redwoods State Park, Redwoods National Park, 
and Richardson Grove State Park.

Effective Buying Income 

 
“Effective Buying Income” is defined as personal income less personal tax and nontax 
payments, a number often referred to as “disposable” or “after-tax” income.  Personal income is 
the  aggregate  of  wages  and  salaries,  other  labor-related  income  (such  as  employer 
contributions  to  private  pension  funds),  proprietor’s  income,  rental  income  (which  includes 
imputed  rental  income  of  owner-occupants  of  non-farm  dwellings),  dividends  paid  by 
corporations, interest income from  all sources, and transfer payments  (such as pensions and 
welfare  assistance).    Deducted  from  this  total  are  personal  taxes  (federal,  state  and  local), 
nontax  payments  (fines,  fees,  penalties,  etc.)  and  personal  contributions  to  social  insurance.  
According  to  U.S.  government  definitions,  the  resultant  figure  is  commonly  known  as 
“disposable personal income.” 

 
The  following  table  summarizes  the  total  effective  buying  income  for  the  County,  the

Commercial Activity 

 
In 2009 the State Board of Equalization converted the business codes of sales and use 
tax permit holders to North American Industry Classification System codes. As a result of the 
coding change, data for 2009 is not comparable to that of prior years. A summary of historic 
taxable  sales  within  the  County  during  2008  through  2012  is  shown  in  the  following  table. 
Annual figures are not available for 2013. 

 
During the first quarter of calendar year 2013, total taxable transactions in the County 
were  reported  to  be  $406,718,000,  representing  a  6.13%  increase  over  the  total  taxable 
transactions  of  $383,236,000  that  were  reported  in  the  County  during  the  first  quarter  of 
calendar year 2012.

PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL 

[LETTERHEAD OF JONES HALL] 

October 2, 2014 

Board of Trustees 
McKinleyville Union School District 
McKinleyville, California   

 
 
OPINION: 

$7,327,431.25  McKinleyville  Union  School  District  (Humboldt  County, 
California) 2014 General Obligation Refunding Bonds 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
2. 

 
3. 

Members of the Board of Trustees: 

 
We have acted as bond counsel to the McKinleyville Union School District (the “District”) 
in  connection  with  the  issuance  by  the  District  of  its  McKinleyville  Union  School  District 
(Humboldt  County,  California),  2014  General  Obligation  Refunding  Bonds  in  the  aggregate 
principal  amount  of  $7,327,431.25  (the  “Refunding  Bonds”),  pursuant  to  Articles  9  and  11  of 
Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code (the “Bond Law”) 
and a resolution of the Board of Trustees of the District (the “Board”) adopted on August 13, 
2014 (the “Resolution”).  We have examined the law and such certified proceedings and other 
papers as we have deemed necessary to render this opinion. 

 
As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon representations of 
the  Board  contained  in  the  Resolution  and  in  the  certified  proceedings  and  certifications  of 
public  officials  and  others  furnished  to  us,  without  undertaking  to  verify  the  same  by 
independent investigation. 

 
Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows: 
 
1. 

The District is duly established and validly existing as a school district with the 
power to enter into the Resolution, to issue the Refunding Bonds and to perform its obligations 
under the Resolution. 

The Resolution has been duly approved by the Board and constitutes a valid and 

binding obligation of the District enforceable against the District in accordance with its terms. 

The Refunding Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the 
District  and  are  valid  and  binding  general  obligations  of  the  District,  and  the  Board  of 
Supervisors of Humboldt County is obligated under the laws of the State of California to cause 

D-1 

to be levied a tax without limit as to rate or amount upon the taxable property in the District for 
the payment when due of the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds. 

Interest  on  the  Refunding  Bonds  is  excluded  from  gross  income  for  federal 
income tax purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative 
minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations; it should be noted, however, that, for the 
purpose  of  computing  the  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  corporations  (as  defined  for 
federal income tax purposes), such interest is taken into account in determining certain income 
and earnings.  The Refunding Bonds are “qualified tax-exempt obligations” within the meaning 
of section 265(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), such that in the case of 
certain financial institutions (within the meaning of section 265(b)(5) of the Code), a deduction is 
allowed for 80 percent of that portion of such financial institutions' interest expense allocable to 
interest payable on the Bonds. The opinions set forth in the preceding sentence are subject to 
the condition that the District comply with all requirements of the Code which must be satisfied 
subsequent  to  the  issuance  of  the  Refunding  Bonds  in  order  that  interest  thereon  be,  or 
continue to be, excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.  The District has 
covenanted  in  the  Resolution  and  in  other  instruments  relating  to  the  Refunding  Bonds  to 
comply  with  each  of  such  requirements;  and  the  District  has  full  legal  authority  to  make  and 
comply with such covenants.  Failure to comply with certain of such requirements may cause 
the  inclusion  of  interest  on  the  Refunding  Bonds  in  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax 
purposes  to  be  retroactive  to  the  date  of  issuance  of  the  Refunding  Bonds.    We  express  no 
opinion regarding other federal tax consequences arising with respect to the Refunding Bonds. 

 

 
4. 

 
5. 

 
 

 

The  interest  on  the  Refunding  Bonds  is  exempt  from  personal  income  taxation 

imposed by the State of California. 

 
The rights of the owners of the Refunding Bonds and the enforceability of the Refunding 
Bonds and the Resolution may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium 
and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights heretofore or hereafter enacted and may also be 
subject to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases. 

Respectfully submitted, 
 
 
 
A Professional Law Corporation

engage a Dissemination Agent to assist it in carrying out its obligations under this Disclosure

Section  9.    Amendment;  Waiver.    Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this 
Disclosure Certificate, the District may amend this Disclosure Certificate, and any provision of 
this Disclosure Certificate may be waived, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: 

(a) 

if the amendment or  waiver relates to the provisions of Sections 
3(a), 4 or 5(a), it may only be made in connection with a change in circumstances 
that arises from a change in legal requirements, change in law, or change in the 
identity,  nature,  or  status  of  an  obligated  person  with  respect  to  the Refunding 
Bonds, or type of business conducted; 

 
(b) 

 
(c)  

the undertakings herein, as proposed to be amended or waived, 
would, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with 
the requirements of the Rule at the time of the primary offering of the Refunding 
Bonds, after taking into account any amendments or interpretations of the Rule, 
as well as any change in circumstances; and 

the  proposed  amendment  or  waiver  either  (i)  is  approved  by 
holders of the Refunding Bonds in the manner provided in the Refunding Bond 
Resolution for amendments to the Refunding Bond Resolution with the consent 
of holders, or (ii) does not, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, 
materially  impair  the  interests  of  the  holders  or  beneficial  owners  of  the 
Refunding Bonds. 
 

E-5 

 

 

If the annual financial information or operating data to be provided in the Annual Report 
is  amended  pursuant  to  the  provisions  hereof,  the  first  annual  financial  information  filed 
pursuant hereto containing the amended operating data or financial information shall explain, in 
narrative  form,  the  reasons  for  the  amendment  and  the  impact  of  the  change  in  the  type  of 
operating data or financial information being provided.  

 
If an amendment is made to the undertaking specifying the accounting principles to be 
followed in preparing financial statements, the annual financial information for the year in which 
the change is made shall present a comparison between the financial statements or information 
prepared on the basis of the new accounting principles and those prepared on the basis of the 
former  accounting  principles.    The  comparison  shall  include  a  qualitative  discussion  of  the 
differences  in  the  accounting  principles  and  the  impact  of  the  change  in  the  accounting 
principles  on  the  presentation  of  the  financial  information,  in  order  to  provide  information  to 
investors to enable them to evaluate the ability of the District to meet its obligations.  To the 
extent reasonably feasible, the comparison shall be quantitative.  A notice of the change in the 
accounting principles shall be filed in the same manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5(c). 

 
Section  10.    Additional  Information.    Nothing  in  this  Disclosure  Certificate  shall  be 
deemed  to  prevent  the  District  from  disseminating  any  other  information,  using  the  means  of 
dissemination set forth in this Disclosure Certificate or any other means of communication, or 
including any other information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event, 
in  addition  to  that  which  is  required  by  this  Disclosure  Certificate.    If  the  District  chooses  to 
include  any  information  in  any  Annual  Report  or  notice  of  occurrence  of  a  Listed  Event  in 
addition to that which is specifically required by this Disclosure Certificate, the District shall have 
no  obligation  under  this  Disclosure  Certificate  to  update  such  information  or  include  it  in  any 
future Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event. 

 
Section 11.  Default.  If the District fails to comply with any provision of this Disclosure 
Certificate,  the  Participating  Underwriter  or  any  holder  or  beneficial  owner  of  the  Refunding 
Bonds may take such actions as may be necessary and appropriate, including seeking mandate 
or specific performance by court order, to cause the District to comply with its obligations under 
this Disclosure Certificate.  A default under this Disclosure Certificate shall not be deemed an 
Event  of  Default  under  the  Refunding  Bond  Resolution,  and  the  sole  remedy  under  this 
Disclosure  Certificate  in  the  event  of  any  failure  of  the  District  to  comply  with  this  Disclosure 
Certificate shall be an action to compel performance. 

 
Section 12.  Duties, Immunities and Liabilities of Dissemination Agent.   
 
(a) 

The Dissemination Agent shall have only such duties as are specifically set forth 
in this Disclosure Certificate, and the District agrees to indemnify and save the Dissemination 
Agent, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless against any loss, expense and 
liabilities which they may incur arising out of or in the exercise or performance of its powers and 
duties  hereunder,  including  the  costs  and  expenses  (including  attorneys  fees)  of  defending 
against  any  claim  of  liability,  but  excluding  liabilities  due  to  the  Dissemination  Agent’s 
negligence  or  willful  misconduct.    The  Dissemination  Agent  will  have  no  duty  or  obligation  to 
review any information provided to it by the District hereunder, and shall not be deemed to be 
acting in any fiduciary capacity for the District, the Refunding Bondholders or any other party.  
The  obligations  of  the  District  under  this  Section  shall  survive  resignation  or  removal  of  the 
Dissemination Agent and payment of the Refunding Bonds. 

E-6 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

(b) The Dissemination Agent shall be paid compensation by the District for its services 
provided hereunder in accordance with its schedule of fees as amended from time to time, and 
shall  be  reimbursed  for  all  expenses,  legal  fees  and  advances  made  or  incurred  by  the 
Dissemination Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder. 

 
Section 13. Beneficiaries.  This Disclosure Certificate shall inure solely to the benefit of 
the District, the Dissemination Agent, the Participating Underwriter and holders and beneficial 
owners from time to time of the Refunding Bonds, and shall create no rights in any other person 
or entity.

APPENDIX F 

 

DTC AND THE BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM 

 

The following description of the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), the procedures and 
record keeping with respect to beneficial ownership interests in the Refunding Bonds, payment 
of  principal,  interest  and  other  payments  on  the  Refunding  Bonds  to  DTC  Participants  or 
Beneficial Owners, confirmation and transfer of beneficial ownership interest in the Refunding 
Bonds  and  other  related  transactions  by  and  between  DTC,  the  DTC  Participants  and  the 
Beneficial  Owners  is  based  solely  on  information  provided  by  DTC.    Accordingly,  no 
representations can be made concerning these matters and neither the DTC Participants nor 
the Beneficial Owners should rely on the foregoing information with respect to such matters, but 
should instead confirm the same with DTC or the DTC Participants, as the case may be.   

 
Neither  the  District  nor  the  Paying  Agent  take  any  responsibility  for  the  information 

contained in this Section.  

 
No  assurances  can  be  given  that  DTC,  DTC  Participants  or  Indirect  Participants  will 
distribute to the Beneficial Owners (a) payments of interest, principal or premium, if any, with 
respect  to  the  Refunding  Bonds,  (b) Bonds  representing  ownership  interest  in  or  other 
confirmation or ownership interest in the Refunding Bonds, or (c) redemption or other notices 
sent to DTC or Cede & Co., its nominee, as the registered owner of the Refunding Bonds, or 
that they will so do on a timely basis, or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants 
will act in the manner described in this Appendix.  The current "Rules" applicable to DTC are on 
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the current "Procedures" of DTC to be 
followed in dealing with DTC Participants are on file with DTC. 

 
1.    The  Depository  Trust  Company  (“DTC”),  New  York,  NY,  will  act  as  securities 
depository for the securities (in this Appendix, the “Bonds”).  The Bonds will be issued as fully-
registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such 
other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered 
Bond will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds, in the aggregate principal amount of such 
maturity,  and  will  be  deposited  with  DTC.  If,  however,  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  any 
maturity exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of 
principal  amount  and  an  additional  certificate  will  be  issued  with  respect  to  any  remaining 
principal amount of such issue. 

 
2.    DTC,  the  world’s  largest  securities  depository,  is  a  limited-purpose  trust  company 
organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the 
New  York  Banking  Law,  a  member  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System,  a  “clearing  corporation” 
within  the  meaning  of  the  New  York  Uniform  Commercial  Code,  and  a  “clearing  agency” 
registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity 
issues,  corporate  and  municipal  debt  issues,  and  money  market  instruments  (from  over  100 
countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC.  DTC also facilitates 
the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in 
deposited  securities,  through  electronic  computerized  book-entry  transfers  and  pledges 
between  Direct  Participants’  accounts.    This  eliminates  the  need  for  physical  movement  of 
securities certificates.  Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and 
dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations.  DTC is 

F-1 

 

a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is 
the  holding  company  for  DTC,  National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  and  Fixed  Income 
Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users 
of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both 
U.S.  and  non-U.S.  securities  brokers  and  dealers,  banks,  trust  companies,  and  clearing 
corporations  that  clear  through  or  maintain  a  custodial  relationship  with  a  Direct  Participant, 
either  directly  or  indirectly  (“Indirect  Participants”).  On  August  8,  2011,  Standard  &  Poor’s 
downgraded its rating of DTC to AA+ from AAA.  The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants 
are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be 
found at www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org. The information contained on this Internet site is not 
incorporated herein by reference. 

 
3.    Purchases  of  Bonds  under  the  DTC  system  must  be  made  by  or  through  Direct 
Participants, which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest 
of  each  actual  purchaser  of  each  Bond  (“Beneficial  Owner”)  is  in  turn  to  be  recorded  on  the 
Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation 
from  DTC  of  their  purchase.  Beneficial  Owners  are,  however,  expected  to  receive  written 
confirmations  providing  details  of  the  transaction,  as  well  as  periodic  statements  of  their 
holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into 
the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries 
made  on  the  books  of  Direct  and  Indirect  Participants  acting  on  behalf  of  Beneficial  Owners. 
Beneficial  Owners  will  not  receive  Bonds  representing  their  ownership  interests  in  Bonds, 
except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued. 

 
4.    To  facilitate  subsequent  transfers,  all  Bonds  deposited  by  Direct  Participants  with 
DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name 
as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DTC 
and  their  registration  in  the  name  of  Cede  &  Co.  or  such  other  nominee  do  not  effect  any 
change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the 
Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such 
Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect 
Participants  will  remain  responsible  for  keeping  account  of  their  holdings  on  behalf  of  their 
customers. 

 
5.  Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by 
Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to 
Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or 
regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may 
wish to take certain steps to augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with 
respect to the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the 
Bond  documents.  For  example,  Beneficial  Owners  of  Bonds  may  wish  to  ascertain  that  the 
nominee  holding  the  Bonds  for  their  benefit  has  agreed  to  obtain  and  transmit  notices  to 
Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and 
addresses to the registrar and request that copies of the notices be provided directly to them. 

 
6.  Redemption notices will be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within an issue 

are being redeemed, the Bonds will be redeemed on a pro rata basis. 

 
7.  Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with 
respect  to  the  Bonds  unless  authorized  by  a  Direct  Participant  in  accordance  with  DTC’s 
Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to District as soon as 

F-2 

 

possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting 
rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Bonds are credited on the record date 
(identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). 

 
8.    Redemption  proceeds,  distributions,  and  interest  payments  on  the  Bonds  will  be 
made  to  Cede  &  Co.,  or  such  other  nominee  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized 
representative  of  DTC.  DTC’s  practice  is  to  credit  Direct  Participants’  accounts,  upon  DTC’s 
receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from District or Paying Agent on payable 
date  in  accordance  with  their  respective  holdings  shown  on  DTC’s  records.  Payments  by 
Participants  to  Beneficial  Owners  will  be  governed  by  standing  instructions  and  customary 
practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or 
registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC nor 
its  nominee,  Paying  Agent,  or  District,  subject  to  any  statutory  or  regulatory  requirements  as 
may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend 
payments  to  Cede  &  Co.  (or  such  other  nominee  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized 
representative  of  DTC)  is  the  responsibility  of  District  or  Paying  Agent,  disbursement  of  such 
payments  to  Direct  Participants  will  be  the  responsibility  of  DTC,  and  disbursement  of  such 
payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. 

 
9.  DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to 
the  Bonds  at  any  time  by  giving  reasonable  notice  to  District  or  Paying  Agent.  Under  such 
circumstances, in the event that a successor securities depository is not obtained, Bonds are 
required to be printed and delivered. 

 
10.    The  District  may  decide  to  discontinue  use  of  the  system  of  book-entry-only 
transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates will 
be printed and delivered to DTC. 

 
11.  The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has 
been  obtained  from  sources  that  District  believes  to  be  reliable,  but  District  takes  no 
responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

BUILD  AMERICA  MUTUAL  ASSURANCE  COMPANY  (“BAM”),  for  consideration  received,  hereby  UNCONDITIONALLY 
AND IRREVOCABLY agrees to pay to the trustee (the “Trustee”) or paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the Bonds named above (as set 
forth in the documentation providing for the issuance and securing of the Bonds), for the benefit of the Owners or, at the election of BAM, 
directly to each Owner, subject only to the terms of this Policy (which includes each endorsement hereto), that portion of the principal of and 
interest on the Bonds that shall become Due for Payment but shall be unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Issuer. 

On  the  later  of  the  day  on  which  such  principal  and  interest  becomes  Due  for  Payment  or  the  first  Business  Day  following  the 
Business Day on which BAM shall have received Notice of Nonpayment, BAM will disburse (but without duplication in the case of duplicate 
claims for the same Nonpayment) to or for the benefit of each Owner of the Bonds, the face amount of principal of and interest on the Bonds 
that is then Due for Payment but is then unpaid by reason of Nonpayment by the Issuer, but only upon receipt by BAM, in a form reasonably 
satisfactory to it, of (a) evidence of the Owner’s right to receive payment of such  principal or interest then Due for Payment and (b) evidence, 
including any appropriate instruments of assignment, that all of the Owner’s rights with respect to payment of such principal or interest that is 
Due for Payment shall thereupon vest in BAM. A Notice of Nonpayment will be deemed received on a given Business Day if it is received 
prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on such Business Day; otherwise, it will be deemed received on the next Business Day.  If any Notice of 
Nonpayment received by BAM is incomplete, it shall be deemed not to have been received by BAM for purposes of the preceding sentence, 
and BAM shall promptly so advise the Trustee, Paying Agent or Owner, as appropriate, any of whom may submit an amended Notice of 
Nonpayment.  Upon disbursement under this Policy in respect of a Bond and to the extent of such payment, BAM shall become the owner of 
such Bond, any appurtenant coupon to such Bond and right to receipt of payment of principal of or interest on such Bond and shall be fully 
subrogated to the rights of the Owner, including the Owner’s right to receive payments under such Bond. Payment by BAM either to the 
Trustee  or  Paying  Agent  for  the  benefit  of  the  Owners,  or  directly  to  the  Owners,  on  account  of  any  Nonpayment  shall  discharge  the 
obligation of BAM under this Policy with respect to said Nonpayment. 

Except to the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, the following terms shall have the meanings specified for all 
purposes of this Policy.  “Business Day” means any day other than (a) a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on which banking institutions in the 
State of New York or the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent (as defined herein) are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.  
“Due for Payment” means (a) when referring to the principal of a Bond, payable on the stated maturity date thereof or the date on which the 
same shall have been duly called for mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by 
reason of call for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration or other advancement of maturity (unless BAM 
shall  elect,  in  its  sole  discretion,  to  pay  such  principal  due  upon  such  acceleration  together  with  any  accrued  interest  to  the  date  of 
acceleration) and (b) when referring to interest on a Bond, payable on the stated date for payment of interest. “Nonpayment” means, in respect 
of a Bond, the failure of the Issuer to have provided sufficient funds to the Trustee or, if there is no Trustee, to the Paying Agent for payment 
in full of all principal and interest that is Due for Payment on such Bond.  “Nonpayment” shall also include, in respect of a Bond, any payment 
made to an Owner by or on behalf of the Issuer of principal or interest that is Due for Payment, which payment has been recovered from such 
Owner pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code in accordance with a final, nonappealable order of a court having competent jurisdiction.  
“Notice” means delivery to BAM of a notice of claim and certificate, by certified mail, email or telecopy as set forth on the attached Schedule or 
other acceptable electronic delivery, in a form satisfactory to BAM, from and signed by an Owner, the Trustee or the Paying Agent, which notice 
shall specify (a) the person or entity making the claim, (b) the Policy Number, (c) the claimed amount, (d) payment instructions and (e) the date such 
claimed amount becomes or became Due for Payment.  “Owner” means, in respect of a Bond, the person or entity who, at the time of Nonpayment, is 
entitled under the terms of such Bond to payment thereof, except that “Owner” shall not include the Issuer, the Member or any other person or entity 
whose direct or indirect obligation constitutes the underlying security for the Bonds. 

 

 

 

BAM may appoint a fiscal agent (the “Insurer’s Fiscal Agent”) for purposes of this Policy by giving written notice to the Trustee, the 
Paying Agent, the Member and the Issuer specifying the name and notice address of the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent.  From and after the date of receipt of 
such notice by the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Member or the Issuer (a) copies of all notices required to be delivered to BAM pursuant to this 
Policy shall be simultaneously delivered to the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent and to BAM and shall not be deemed received until received by both and (b) all 
payments required to be made by BAM under this Policy may be made directly by BAM or by the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent on behalf of BAM.  The 
Insurer’s Fiscal Agent is the agent of BAM only, and the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent shall in no event be liable to the Trustee, Paying Agent or any Owner 
for any act of the Insurer’s Fiscal Agent or any failure of BAM to deposit or cause to be deposited sufficient funds to make payments due under this 
Policy. 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, BAM agrees not to assert, and hereby waives, only for the benefit of each Owner, all 
rights  (whether  by  counterclaim,  setoff  or  otherwise)  and  defenses  (including,  without  limitation,  the  defense  of  fraud),  whether  acquired  by 
subrogation, assignment or otherwise, to the extent that such rights and defenses may be available to BAM to avoid payment of its obligations under 
this Policy in accordance with the express provisions of this Policy.  This Policy may not be canceled or revoked. 

This Policy sets forth in full the undertaking of BAM and shall not be modified, altered or affected by any other agreement or instrument, 
including any modification or amendment thereto.  Except to the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, any premium paid in respect of 
this Policy is nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever, including payment, or provision being made for payment, of the Bonds prior to maturity. 
THIS POLICY IS NOT COVERED BY THE PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE SECURITY FUND SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 76 OF THE 
NEW YORK INSURANCE LAW.  THIS POLICY IS ISSUED WITHOUT CONTINGENT MUTUAL LIABILITY FOR ASSESSMENT.  

In witness whereof, BUILD AMERICA MUTUAL ASSURANCE COMPANY has caused this Policy to be executed on its behalf by its 

Authorized Officer.
