In  the  opinion  of  Jones  Hall,  A  Professional  Law  Corporation,  San  Francisco,  California,  Bond  Counsel,  subject,  however  to  certain 
qualifications described in this Official Statement, under existing law, interest on the Series C Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal 
income  tax  purposes,  and  such  interest  is  not  an  item  of  tax  preference  for  purposes  of  the  federal  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on 
individuals and corporations, although for the purpose of computing the alternative minimum tax imposed on certain corporations, interest on the 
Series C Bonds is taken into account in determining certain income and earnings, and the Series C Bonds are “qualified tax-exempt obligations” 
within the meaning of section 265(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Series C 
Bonds is exempt from California personal income taxes.  See “TAX MATTERS.”

For more information regarding the District and its finances, see Appendix A and Appendix 
B  attached  hereto.    See  also  Appendix  C  for  demographic  and  other  statistical  information 
regarding the City and the County. 

 
Purpose.    The  net  proceeds  of  the  Series  C  Bonds  will  be  used  to  finance  school

Section 53506 thereof (the “Bond Law”), and pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Governing

described herein.  See “THE SERIES C BONDS  – Optional Redemption.”  

 
Security and Sources of Payment for the Series C Bonds.  The Series C Bonds are 
general obligation bonds of the District payable solely from ad valorem property taxes levied on 
taxable  property  located  in  the  District and  collected  by  the  County.  The  County  is  empowered 
and is obligated to annually levy ad valorem taxes for the payment of interest on, and principal of,

amount (except with respect to certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates). The 
Series C Bonds are the third series of bonds issued pursuant to the authority obtained by District 
voters at the Bond Election.  See “SECURITY FOR THE SERIES C BONDS.” 

 
Bond  Insurance.    The  scheduled  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Series  C 
Bonds  when  due  will  be  guaranteed  under  a  municipal  bond  insurance  policy  to  be  issued 
concurrently with the delivery of the Series C Bonds by Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. See 
“BOND INSURANCE.”  

 
Tax-Exempt Status.   In the opinion of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, bond 
counsel to the District (“Bond Counsel”), interest on the Series C Bonds is excluded from gross 
income for federal income tax purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the 
federal  individual  and  corporate  alternative  minimum  taxes,  although  it  is  included  in  certain 
income and earnings in computing the alternative minimum tax imposed on certain corporations.  
In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, such interest is exempt from California personal income 
taxes.  See “TAX MATTERS” and Appendix D hereto for the forms of Bond Counsel’s opinions to 
be delivered concurrently with the Series C Bonds. 

 
Legal Opinion; Bank Qualified.  Upon delivery of the Bond Counsel will release its final 
approving legal opinion with respect to the Series C Bonds, regarding the validity and tax-exempt 
status  of  the  Series  C  Bonds,  in  the  form  attached  hereto  as  Appendix  D.    In  addition,  Bond 
Counsel  will  opine  that  the  Series  C  Bonds  are  “qualified  tax-exempt  obligations”  within  the 
meaning of section 265(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, subject to certain limitations 
as set forth in such opinion.

THE FINANCING PLAN 

 

The proceeds of the Series C Bonds will be used to finance projects approved by 
the voters at the Bond Election.  The abbreviated form of the ballot measure is as follows: 

“To  improve  local  schools  by  improving  classrooms,  vocational/agricultural  job 
training  and  technology;  fixing  deteriorating  roofs,  bathrooms,  plumbing/electrical 
systems;  removing  asbestos,  mold/lead  paint; 
fire  safety;  and 
constructing/equipping district facilities/sites shall Anderson Valley Unified School 
District issue $15,250,000 in bonds at legal interest rates, with independent audits, 
citizens'  oversight,  no  money  for  administrators'  salaries/pensions,  and  all  funds 
used locally?” 
 
The Series C Bonds were authorized at an election of the registered voters of the District 
held on June 8, 2010, which authorized the issuance of $15,250,000 principal amount of general 
obligation  bonds  (the  “Authorization”)  for  the  purpose  of  financing  the  renovation,  construction 
and improvement of school facilities. 

improving 

 
Pursuant to the Authorization, the District has issued: 
 

 

 

 

•  $2,200,000 Taxable Direct-Pay New Clean Renewable Energy General Obligation 

Bonds, 2010 Election, Series A (the “Series A Bonds”),  

•  $4,223,484.70  General  Obligation  Bonds,  2010  Election,  Series  B-1  (the  “Series 

B-1 Bonds”), and 

•  $60,000  Federally  Taxable  General  Obligation  Bonds,  2010  Election,  Series  B-2 

(the “Series B-2 Bonds”). 

 

The  Series  B-2  Bonds  matured  in  2011  and  are  no  longer  outstanding.  The  Series  A 
Bonds and the Series B-1 Bonds are payable from ad valorem taxes levied on taxable parcels in 
the  District.  In  addition,  the  Series  A  Bonds  are  further  secured  by  and  payable  from  the 
“Refundable Credit Payments” described in this paragraph. The District designated the Series A 
Bonds  as  “New  Clean  Renewable  Energy  Bonds”  under  Section  54C  of  the  Tax  Code  and  the 
Series A Bonds are “Specified Tax Credit Bonds” under Section 6431(f) of the Tax Code which 
makes the District eligible for the credit payable from the United States Treasury.  Although the 
District  has  pledged  the  Refundable  Credit  Payments  to  the  Series  A  Bonds,  the  District  has 
covenanted to cause the County to levy sufficient ad valorem taxes in the District to provide for 
the  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Series  A  Bonds.    Therefore,  in  the  event  the 
Refundable  Credit  Payments  are  not  received  and  deposited  in  the  Debt  Service  Fund,  the 
County will be required to levy ad valorem taxes in an amount sufficient to pay the full amount of 
debt service on the Series A Bonds.  

 
See  “DEBT  SERVICE  SCHEDULES”  for  the  remaining  debt  service  on  the  Outstanding 

Bonds.

Authority for Issuance 
 

THE SERIES C BONDS 

The Series C Bonds will be issued under the Bond Law and the Bond Resolution.  The 
Series C Bonds are the third series of bonds to be issued under the Authorization. After the Series 
C Bonds are issued, there will be $7,499,101.20 of Authorization remaining. 

 
See  “DEBT  SERVICE  SCHEDULES”  below  for  the  remaining  debt  service  on  the 

Outstanding Bonds. 
 
Description of the Series C Bonds 

 
The Series C Bonds are being issued as Current Interest Bonds and Capital Appreciation 
Bonds, both as described below. The Series C Bonds mature in the years and in the amounts as 
set forth on the inside cover page hereof.   The Series C Bonds will be issued in book-entry form 
only, and will be initially issued and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for DTC. 
Purchasers will not receive physical certificates representing their interest in the Series C Bonds. 
See  “Book-Entry  Only  System”  below  and  “APPENDIX  F  –  DTC  and  the  Book-Entry  Only 
System.”   

 
Current Interest Bonds. The Current Interest Bonds shall be issued in the denominations 
of $5,000 principal amount each or any integral multiple thereof. Interest on the Current Interest 
Bonds is payable semiannually on each February 1 and August 1, commencing August 1, 2015 
(each,  an  “Interest  Payment  Date”).    Each  Current  Interest  Bond  will  bear  interest  from  the 
Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of registration and authentication thereof unless (i) 
it is authenticated as of an Interest Payment Date, in which event it will bear interest from such 
date, or (ii) it is authenticated prior to an Interest Payment Date and after the close of business on 
the fifteenth (15th) day of the month preceding the Interest Payment Date (the “Record Date”), in 
which event it will bear interest from such Interest Payment Date, or (iii) it is authenticated prior to 
July 15, 2015, in which event it will bear interest from the date of delivery of the Series C Bonds 
identified  on  the  cover  page  hereof.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  interest  on  any  Current 
Interest  Bond  is  in  default  at  the  time  of  authentication  thereof,  such  Current  Interest  Bond  will 
bear interest from the Interest Payment Date to which interest has previously been paid or made 
available  for  payment  thereon.    Payments  of  principal  of  and  interest  on  the  Current  Interest 
Bonds will be paid by the Paying Agent to DTC for subsequent disbursement to DTC Participants 
who will remit such payments to the beneficial owners of the Current Interest Bonds. 

 
Capital  Appreciation  Bonds.    The  Capital  Appreciation  Bonds  are  dated  the  date  of 
delivery,  and  accrete  interest  from  such  date.  The  Capital  Appreciation  Bonds  are  issuable  in 
denominations of $5,000 Maturity Value (defined below) or any integral multiple thereof (except 
that one Capital Appreciation Bond may be issued in a denomination the Maturity Value of which 
is not an integral multiple of $5,000). The Capital Appreciation Bonds are payable only at maturity 
or upon earlier redemption, according to the amounts set forth in the accreted value table. See 
“APPENDIX H - TABLE OF ACCRETED VALUES.”  

 
The  Capital  Appreciation  Bonds  do  not  bear  current  interest,  but  accrete  in  value, 
compounded on each February 1 and August 1, commencing on August 1, 2015, to maturity, from 
their  original  principal  amounts  (the  “Denominational  Amount”)  on  the  date  of  delivery  to  its 
stated  value  at  maturity  (the  “Maturity  Value”).  See  “APPENDIX  H  -  TABLE  OF  ACCRETED 
VALUES.” 

-5- 

 
The  interest  portion  of  the  Maturity  Value  of  any  Capital  Appreciation  Bond  which  is 
payable on the date of maturity shall represent interest accrued and coming due on such date. 
The Maturity Value of any Capital Appreciation Bond at maturity shall be payable by check mailed 
by  first-class  mail,  in  lawful  money  of  the  United  States  of  America  upon  presentation  and 
surrender of such Capital Appreciation Bond at the Office of the Paying Agent.  

Book-Entry Only System 

 
 The Series C Bonds will be issued in book-entry form only, and will be initially issued and 
registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, 
New York (“DTC”).  Purchasers of the Series C Bonds (the “Beneficial Owners”) will not receive 
physical certificates representing their interest in the Series C Bonds.  Payments of principal of 
and interest on the Series C Bonds will be paid by The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, 
N.A.,  Dallas,  Texas  (the  “Paying  Agent”)  to  DTC  for  subsequent  disbursement  to  DTC 
Participants which will remit such payments to the Beneficial Owners of the Series C Bonds.   

 
As long as DTC’s book-entry method is used for the Series C Bonds, the Paying Agent will 
send any notice of prepayment or other notices to owners only to DTC.  Any failure of DTC to 
advise any DTC Participant, or of any DTC Participant to notify any Beneficial Owner, of any such 
notice and its content or effect will not affect the validity or sufficiency of the proceedings relating 
to the prepayment of the Series C Bonds called for prepayment or of any other action premised 
on such notice.  See “APPENDIX F - DTC AND THE BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM.” 

 
The  Paying  Agent,  the  District,  and  the  Underwriter  of  the  Series  C  Bonds  have  no 
responsibility or liability for any aspects of the records relating to or payments made on account of 
beneficial ownership, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to beneficial 
ownership, of interests in the Series C Bonds. 

 

 

Optional Redemption 

 
Current Interest Bonds.  The Current Interest Bonds are subject to redemption prior to 
maturity, at the option of the District, in whole or in part among maturities on such basis as shall 
be designated by the District and by lot within a maturity, from any available source of funds, on 
August  1,  2025,  or  on  any  date  thereafter,  at  a  price  equal  to  100%  of  the  principal  amount 
thereof, without premium, together with accrued interest thereon to the redemption date. 

 
Capital  Appreciation  Bonds.    The  Capital  Appreciation  Bonds  maturing  on  or  after 
August 1, 2025 are subject to redemption prior to maturity, at the option of the District, in whole or 
in part among maturities on such basis as shall be designated by the District and by lot within a 
maturity, from any available source of funds, on February 1, 2025, or on any date thereafter, at a 
price equal to 100% of the Accreted Value thereof as of the date of redemption, without premium. 

 
Selection  of  Bonds  for  Purpose  of  Redemption.    For  the  purpose  of  selection  for 
optional  redemption,  Series  C  Bonds  will  be  deemed  to  consist  of  $5,000  portions  (principal 
amount  or  Maturity  Value,  as  applicable),  and  any  such  portion  may  be  separately  redeemed. 
Whenever less than all of the outstanding Series C Bonds of any one maturity are designated for 
redemption, the Paying Agent shall select the outstanding Series C Bonds of such maturity to be 
redeemed by lot in any manner deemed fair by the Paying Agent.  For purposes of such selection, 
each Series C Bond will be deemed to consist of individual bonds of $5,000 portions (principal 
amount or Maturity Value, as applicable).  The Series C Bonds may all be separately redeemed. 

-6- 

 

Notice of Redemption 

 
The Paying Agent is required to give notice of the redemption of the Series C Bonds, at 
the expense of the District, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for 
redemption. Notice of any redemption of Series C Bonds shall specify:  (a) the Series C Bonds or 
designated portions thereof (in the case of redemption of the Series C Bonds in part but not in 
whole) which are to be redeemed, (b) the date of redemption, (c) the place or places where the 
redemption will be made, including the name and address of the Paying Agent, (d) the redemption 
price,  (e)  the  CUSIP  numbers  (if  any)  assigned  to  the Series  C  Bonds  to  be  redeemed,  (f)  the 
Series C Bond numbers of the Series C Bonds to be redeemed in whole or in part and, in the 
case of any Series C Bond to be redeemed in part only, the principal amount of such Series C 
Bond  to  be  redeemed,  and  (g)  the  original  issue  date,  interest  rate  and  stated  maturity  date  of 
each Series C Bond to be redeemed in whole or in part.  Such notice shall further state that on the 
specified date there shall become due and payable upon each Series C Bond or portion thereof 
being redeemed the redemption price thereof, and that from and after such date, interest thereon 
shall cease to accrue. 

 
Neither failure to receive or failure to send any notice of redemption nor any defect in any 
such redemption notice so given shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the redemption 
of the affected Series C Bonds. 

Partial Redemption of Bonds 

 
Upon the surrender of any Series C Bond redeemed in part only, the Paying Agent shall 
execute and deliver to the Owner thereof a new Series C Bond or Bonds of like tenor and maturity 
and  of  authorized  denominations  equal  in  transfer  amounts  to  the  unredeemed  portion  of  the 
Series C Bond surrendered.  Such partial redemption shall be valid upon payment of the amount 
required  to  be  paid  to  such  Owner,  and  the  County  and  the  District  shall  be  released  and 
discharged thereupon from all liability to the extent of such payment. 
 
Right to Rescind Notice of Redemption 

 
The  District  has  the  right  to  rescind  any  notice  of  the  optional  redemption  of  Series  C 
Bonds  by  written  notice  to  the  Paying  Agent  on  or  prior  to  the  date  fixed  for  redemption.    Any 
notice of redemption shall be cancelled and annulled if for any reason funds will not be or are not 
available on the date fixed for redemption for the payment in full of the Series C Bonds then called 
for redemption.  The District and the Paying Agent have no liability to the Bond owners or any 
other party related to or arising from such rescission of redemption.  The Paying Agent shall mail 
notice of such rescission of redemption in the same manner as the original notice of redemption 
was sent under the Bond Resolution. 

Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Bonds 

 
If  the  book  entry  system  is  discontinued,  the  District  shall  cause  the  Paying  Agent  to 
maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and records necessary for the 
registration, exchange and transfer of the Series C Bonds. 

 
If the book entry system is discontinued, the person in whose name a Series C Bond is 
registered on the Bond Register shall be regarded as the absolute owner of that Bond.  Payment 
of the principal of and interest on any Series C Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of 

 

 

-7- 

that person; neither the District, the County nor the Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice 
to the contrary, but the registration may be changed as provided the Bond Resolution.   

 
Bonds  may  be  exchanged  at  the  principal  corporate  trust  office  of  the  Paying  Agent  in 
Dallas,  Texas  for  a  like  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Series  C  Bonds  of  authorized 
denominations and of the same maturity.  Any Series C Bond may, in accordance with its terms, 
but only if (i) the District determines to no longer maintain the book entry only status of the Series 
C Bonds, (ii) DTC determines to discontinue providing such services and no successor securities 
depository  is  named  or  (iii)  DTC  requests  the  District  to  deliver  Series  C  Bond  certificates  to 
particular DTC Participants, be transferred, upon the books required to be kept pursuant to the 
provisions of the Bond Resolution, by the person in whose name it is registered, in person or by 
his duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of such Series C Bond for cancellation at the office of 
the Paying Agent, accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer in a form approved 
by the Paying Agent, duly executed. 

 
No exchanges of Series C Bonds shall be required to be made (a) fifteen days prior to an 
Interest  Payment  Date  or  the  date  established  by  the  Paying  Agent  for  selection  of  Series  C 
Bonds for redemption until the close of business on the Interest Payment Date or day on which 
the  applicable  notice  of  redemption  is  given  or  (b)  with  respect  to  a  Series  C  Bond  after  such 
Series C Bond has been selected or called for redemption in whole or in part.  

 
The Series C Bonds may be paid by the District, in whole or in part, in any one or more of 

 

Defeasance 

the following ways: 

(i)  lawful  money  of  the  United  States  of  America  in  an  amount  equal  to  the 
principal amount of such Series C Bonds and all unpaid interest thereon to 
maturity,  except  that,  in  the  case  of  Series  C  Bonds  which  are  to  be 
redeemed  prior  to  maturity  and  in  respect  of  which  notice  of  such 
redemption  is  given  as  provided  in  the  Bond  Resolution  or  provision 
satisfactory to the Paying Agent is made for the giving of such notice, the 
amount to be deposited or held will be the principal amount or redemption 

-8- 

by  paying  or  causing  to  be  paid  the  principal  or  redemption  price  of  and 
interest on such Series C Bonds, as and when the same become due and 
payable; 

by irrevocably depositing, in trust, at or before maturity, money or securities 
in  the  necessary  amount  (as  provided  in  the  Bond  Resolution)  to  pay  or 
redeem such Series C Bonds; or 

by delivering such Series C Bonds to the Paying Agent for cancellation by 
it. 

 
Whenever in the Bond Resolution it is provided or permitted that there be deposited with 
or  held  in  trust  by  the  Paying  Agent  money  or  securities  in  the  necessary  amount  to  pay  or 
redeem any Series C Bonds, the money or securities so to be deposited or held may be held by 
the  Paying  Agent  or  by  any  other  fiduciary.  Such  money  or  securities  may  include  money  or 
securities  held  by  the  Paying  Agent  in  the  funds  and  accounts  established  under  the  Bond 
Resolution and will be: 

 
(a) 

 
(b) 

 
(c) 

 

price  of  such  Series  C  Bonds  and  all  unpaid  interest  thereon  to  the 
redemption date; or 

 
(ii)  Federal Securities (not callable by the issuer thereof prior to maturity) the 
principal  of  and  interest  on  which  when  due,  in  the  opinion  of  a  certified 
public  accountant  delivered  to  the  County  and  the  District,  will  provide 
money sufficient to pay the principal or redemption price of and all unpaid 
interest to maturity, or to the redemption date, as the case may be, on the 
Series  C  Bonds  to  be  paid  or  redeemed,  as  such  principal  or  redemption 
price and interest become due, provided that, in the case of Series C Bonds 
which  are  to  be  redeemed  prior  to  the  maturity  thereof,  notice  of  such 
redemption  is  given  as  provided  in  the  Bond  Resolution  or  provision 
satisfactory to the Paying Agent is made for the giving of such notice. 

 
Upon the deposit, in trust, at or before maturity, of money or securities in the necessary 
amount (as described above) to pay or redeem any outstanding Series C Bond (whether upon or 
prior to its maturity or the redemption date of such Bond), then all liability of the County and the 
District in respect of such Series C Bond will cease and be completely discharged, except only 
that thereafter the owner thereof will be entitled only to payment of the principal of and interest on 
such Series C Bond by the District, and the District will remain liable for such payment, but only 
out of such money or securities deposited with the Paying Agent for such payment. 

 
“Federal Securities” means United States Treasury notes, bonds, bills or certificates of 
indebtedness, or obligations issued by any agency or department of the United States which are 
secured, directly or indirectly, by the full faith and credit of the United States.

APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF THE SERIES C BONDS 

  

Building Fund 
  

Pursuant to the Bond Resolution, the net proceeds from the sale of the Series C Bonds 
will  be  paid  and  credited  to  the  fund  established  and  held  by  the Mendocino  County  Treasurer 
(the “County Treasurer”) and designated as the “Anderson Valley Unified School District, 2015 
Building Fund”  (the “Building Fund”).  Amounts credited to the Building Fund will be expended 
by  the  District  for  the  purpose  of  financing  any  of  the  projects  for  which  the  Series  C  Bond 
proceeds  are  authorized  to  be  expended  under  the  Authorization  and  further  including  all 
incidental  expenses  and  related  costs  of  issuance.    All  interest  and  other  gain  arising  from  the 
investment of proceeds of the Series C Bonds will be retained in the Building Fund and used for 
the  purposes  thereof.    All  moneys  held  in  the  Building  Fund  will  be  invested  in  Authorized 
Investments (as defined in the Bond Resolution) in accordance with the investment policies of the 
County, as such policies exist at the time of investment.  Pursuant to the Bond Resolution and 
applicable provisions of the Education Code, a portion of the proceeds of the Series C Bonds may 
be  deposited  with  a  fiscal  agent  for  the  purpose  of  paying  costs  of  issuance.    See  also

INVESTMENT REPORT” herein. 
  
Debt Service Fund 
  

-  MENDOCINO  COUNTY 

Pursuant to the Bond Resolution, premium, if any, received by the County from the sale of 
the Series C Bonds, will be deposited and kept separate and apart in the fund established and 
held  by  the  County  Treasurer  and  designated  as  the  “Anderson  Valley  Unified  School  District, 
2015  Debt  Service  Fund”  (the  “Debt  Service  Fund”),  which  is  pledged  for  the  payment  of  the 
principal of and interest on the Series C Bonds when and as the same become due.  All taxes 
levied by the County for the payment of the principal of and interest and premium (if any) on the 
Series  C  Bonds  will  be  deposited  in  the  Debt  Service  Fund  by  the  County  promptly  upon 
apportionment of said levy. 
  

Any moneys remaining in the Debt Service Fund after the Series C Bonds and the interest 
thereon have been paid, shall be transferred to any other interest and sinking fund or account for 
general obligation bond indebtedness of the District, including refunding bonds, and in the event 
there is no such debt outstanding, shall be transferred to the District’s general fund upon the order 
of the County Auditor, as provided in Section 15234 of the Education Code. 
  
Investment of Proceeds of Series C Bonds 
  

All  moneys  held  in  any  of  the  funds  or  accounts  established  with  the  County  under  the 
Bond Resolution will be invested in Authorized Investments (as defined in the Bond Resolution) in 
accordance  with  the  investment  policies  of  the  County,  as  such  policies  exist  at  the  time  of 
investment.  Obligations purchased as an investment of moneys in any fund or account will be 
deemed to be part of such fund or account.  All interest or gain derived from the investment of 
amounts in any of the funds or accounts established under the Bond Resolution will be deposited 
in  the  fund  or  account  from  which  such  investment  was  made,  and  will  be  expended  for  the 
purposes thereof. 

  
In  accordance  with  Government  Code  Section  53600  et  seq.,  the  County  Treasurer 
manages funds deposited with it by the District.  The County is required to invest such funds in 
accordance with California Government Code Sections 53601 et seq.  In addition, counties are 

-12- 

required  to  establish  their  own  investment  policies  which  may  impose  limitations  beyond  those 
required by the Government Code.  See “APPENDIX G - MENDOCINO COUNTY INVESTMENT 
POLICY AND QUARTERLY INVESTMENT REPORT.” 
 

SECURITY FOR THE SERIES C BONDS 

 

 
Ad Valorem Taxes 
 

Bonds  Payable  from  Ad  Valorem  Property  Taxes.    The  Series  C  Bonds  are  general 
obligations  of  the  District,  payable  solely  from  ad  valorem  property  taxes  levied  on  taxable 
property  within  the  District  and  collected  by  the  County.    The  County  is  empowered  and  is 
obligated  to  annually  levy  ad  valorem  taxes  for  the  payment  of  the  Series  C  Bonds  and  the 
interest  thereon  upon  all  property  within  the  District  subject  to  taxation  by  the  District,  without 
limitation  of  rate  or  amount  (except  certain  personal  property  which  is  taxable  at  limited  rates). 
The District has other series of general obligation bonds outstanding that are similarly paid from 
ad valorem taxes levied on taxable parcels in the District.  

 
Other  Debt  Payable  from  Ad  Valorem  Property  Taxes.    In  addition  to  the  Series  A 
Bonds  and  the  Series  B-1  Bonds,  there  is  other  debt  issued  by  entities  with  jurisdiction  in  the 
District,  which  is  payable  from  ad  valorem  taxes  levied  on  parcels  in  the  District.    See 
“PROPERTY TAXATION – Tax Rates” and “- Direct and Overlapping Debt” below. 

 
Levy  and  Collection.    The  County  will  levy  and  collect  such  ad  valorem  taxes  in  such 
amounts and at such times as is necessary to ensure the timely payment of debt service.  Such 
taxes, when collected, will be deposited into a debt service fund for the Series C Bonds, which is 
maintained by the County and which is irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and 
interest on the Series C Bonds when due.  

 
District property taxes are assessed and collected by the County in the same manner and 
at the same time, and in the same installments as other ad valorem taxes on real property, and 
will have the same priority, become delinquent at the same times and in the same proportionate 
amounts,  and  bear  the  same  proportionate  penalties  and  interest  after  delinquency,  as  do  the 
other ad valorem taxes on real property.  

 
Annual  Tax  Rates.    The  amount  of  the  annual  ad  valorem  tax  levied  by  the  County  to 
repay the Series C Bonds will be determined by the relationship between the assessed valuation 
of  taxable  property  in  the  District  and  the  amount  of  debt  service  due  on  the  Series  C  Bonds.  
Fluctuations in the annual debt service on the Series C Bonds and the assessed value of taxable 
property in the District may cause the annual tax rate to fluctuate.   

 
Economic  and  other  factors  beyond  the  District’s  control,  such  as  economic  recession, 
deflation of land values, a relocation out of the District or financial difficulty or bankruptcy by one 
or  more  major  property  taxpayers,  or  the  complete  or  partial  destruction  of  taxable  property 
caused  by,  among  other  eventualities,  earthquake,  flood,  fire  or  other  natural  disaster,  could 
cause  a  reduction  in  the  assessed  value  within  the  District  and  necessitate  a  corresponding 
increase in the annual tax rate.  

 

-13- 

Debt Service Fund 

 
The  County  will  establish  the  Debt  Service  Fund  for  the  Series  C  Bonds,  which  will  be 
established as a separate fund to be maintained distinct from all other funds of the County.  All 
taxes levied by the County for the payment of the principal of and interest and premium (if any) on 
the Series C Bonds will be deposited in the Debt Service Fund by the County promptly upon the 
receipt.  The Debt Service Fund is pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest and 
premium (if any) on the Series C Bonds when and as the same become due.  The County will 
transfer amounts in the Debt Service Fund to the Paying Agent to the extent necessary to pay the 
principal of and interest and premium (if any) on the Series C Bonds as the same becomes due 
and payable. 

 
If, after payment in full of the Series C Bonds, any amounts remain on deposit in the Debt 
Service Fund, the District shall transfer such amounts to its general fund, to be applied solely in a 
manner which is consistent with the requirements of applicable state and federal tax law. 

 

 

Not a County Obligation  

 
The Series C Bonds are payable solely from the proceeds of an ad valorem tax levied and 
collected  by  the  County,  for  the  payment  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  Series  C  Bonds.  
Although the County is obligated to collect the  ad valorem tax for the payment of the Series C 
Bonds, the Series C Bonds are not a debt of the County.

Property Tax Collection Procedures  

PROPERTY TAXATION 

 
In  California,  property  which  is  subject  to ad  valorem  taxes  is  classified  as  “secured”  or 
“unsecured.”    The  “secured  roll”  is  that  part  of  the  assessment  roll  containing  state  assessed 
public  utilities’  property  and  real  property,  the  taxes  on  which  create  a  lien  on  such  property 
sufficient, in the opinion of the county assessor, to secure payment of the taxes.  A tax levied on 
unsecured property does not become a lien against such unsecured property, but may become a 
lien on certain other property owned by the taxpayer.  Every tax which becomes a lien on secured 
property has priority over all other liens arising pursuant to State law on such secured property, 
regardless  of  the  time  of  the  creation  of  the  other  liens.    Secured  and  unsecured  property  are 
entered  separately  on  the  assessment  roll  maintained  by  the  county  assessor.    The  method  of 
collecting delinquent taxes is substantially different for the two classifications of property. 

 
Property  taxes  on  the  secured  roll  are  due  in  two  installments,  on  November  1  and 
February 1 of each fiscal year.  If unpaid, such taxes become delinquent after December 10 and 
April  10,  respectively,  and  a  10%  penalty  attaches  to  any  delinquent  payment.    In  addition, 
property on the secured roll with respect to which taxes are delinquent is declared tax defaulted 
on or about June 30 of the fiscal year.  Such property may thereafter be redeemed by payment of 
the delinquent taxes and a delinquency penalty, plus a redemption penalty of 1-1/2% per month to 
the  time  of  redemption.    If  taxes  are  unpaid  for  a  period  of  five  years  or  more,  the  property  is 
subject to sale by the County. 

 
Property  taxes  are  levied  for  each  fiscal  year  on  taxable  real  and  personal  property 
situated in the taxing jurisdiction as of the preceding January 1.  A bill enacted in 1983, SB813 
(Statutes  of  1983,  Chapter  498),  however,  provided  for  the  supplemental  assessment  and 
taxation  of  property  as  of  the  occurrence  of  a  change  of  ownership  or  completion  of  new 
construction.  Thus, this legislation eliminated delays in the realization of increased property taxes 
from new assessments.  As amended, SB813 provided increased revenue to taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent that supplemental assessments of new construction or changes of ownership occur 
subsequent to the January 1 lien date and result in increased assessed value. 

 
Property  taxes  on  the  unsecured  roll  are  due  on  the  January  1  lien  date  and  become 
delinquent, if unpaid on the following August 31.  A 10% penalty is also attached to delinquent 
taxes in respect of property on the unsecured roll, and further, an additional penalty of 1-1/2% per 
month accrues with respect to such taxes beginning the first day of the third month following the 
delinquency date.  The taxing authority has four ways of collecting unsecured personal property 
taxes: (1) a civil action against the taxpayer; (2) filing a certificate in the office of the county clerk 
specifying certain facts in order to obtain a judgment lien on certain property of the taxpayer; (3) 
filing a certificate of delinquency for record in the county recorder’s office, in order to obtain a lien 
on certain property of the taxpayer; and (4) seizure and sale of personal property, improvements 
or  possessory  interests  belonging  or  assessed  to  the  assessee.    The  exclusive  means  of 
enforcing the payment of delinquent taxes in respect of property on the secured roll is the sale of 
the property securing the taxes for the amount of taxes which are delinquent. 

Taxation of State-Assessed Utility Property 

 
The State Constitution provides that most classes of property owned or used by regulated 
utilities  be  assessed  by  the  State  Board  of  Equalization  (“SBE”)  and  taxed  locally.    Property 

 

 

-15- 

valued by the SBE as an operating unit in a primary function of the utility taxpayer is known as 
“unitary  property”,  a  concept  designed  to  permit  assessment  of  the  utility  as  a  going  concern 
rather  than  assessment  of  each  individual  element  of  real  and  personal  property  owned  by  the 
utility  taxpayer.    State-assessed  unitary  and  “operating  nonunitary”  property  (which  excludes 
nonunitary property of regulated railways) is allocated to the counties based on the situs of the 
various components of the unitary property.  Except for unitary property of regulated railways and 
certain other excepted property, all unitary and operating nonunitary property is taxed at special 
county-wide  rates  and  tax  proceeds  are  distributed  to  taxing  jurisdictions  according  to  statutory 
formulae generally based on the distribution of taxes in the prior year.

Appeals of Assessed Value  

tax revenues within the District. 
 

 
There are two types of appeals of assessed values that could adversely impact property 

Appeals may be based on Proposition 8 of November 1978, which requires that for each 
January 1 lien date, the taxable value of real property must be the lesser of its base year value, 
annually adjusted by the inflation factor pursuant to Article XIIIA of the State Constitution, or its full 
cash  value,  taking  into  account  reductions  in  value  due  to  damage,  destruction,  depreciation, 
obsolescence,  removal  of  property  or  other  factors  causing  a  decline  in  value.    See 
“CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND 
APPROPRIATIONS – Article XIIIA of the California Constitution” in Appendix B.  
 

Under  California  law,  property  owners  may  apply  for  a  Proposition  8  reduction  of  their 
property tax assessment by filing a written application, in form prescribed by the State Board of 
Equalization, with the County board of equalization or assessment appeals board.  In most cases, 
the  appeal  is  filed  because  the  applicant  believes  that  present  market  conditions  (such  as 

-18- 

residential  home  prices)  cause  the  property  to  be  worth  less  than  its  current  assessed  value.  
Proposition 8 reductions may also be unilaterally applied by the County Assessor. 
 

Any reduction in the assessment ultimately granted as a result of such appeal applies to 
the year for which application is made and during which the written application was filed.  These 
reductions are subject to yearly reappraisals and are adjusted back to their original values when 
market conditions improve.  Once the property has regained its prior value, adjusted for inflation, it 
once again is subject to the annual inflationary factor growth rate allowed under Article XIIIA. 
 

A second type of assessment appeal involves a challenge to the base year value of an 
assessed property.  Appeals for reduction in the base year value of an assessment, if successful, 
reduce  the  assessment  for  the  year  in  which  the  appeal  is  taken  and  prospectively  thereafter.  
The base year is determined by the completion date of new construction or the date of change of 
ownership.  Any base year appeal must be made within four years of the change of ownership or 
new construction date.  

 
The District cannot predict the changes in assessed values that might result from pending 
or  future  appeals  by  taxpayers.    Any  reduction  in  aggregate  District  assessed  valuation  due  to 
appeals, as with any reduction in assessed valuation due to other causes, will cause the tax rate 
levied to repay the Series C Bonds to increase accordingly, so that the fixed debt service on the 
Series C Bonds (and other outstanding general obligation bonds, if any) may be paid. 

 
 The table below summarizes the total ad valorem tax rates levied by all taxing entities in a 
representative  tax  rate  area  (TRA  53-008)  during  fiscal  years  2010-11  through  2014-15.  The 
2014-15 assessed valuation in TRA 53-008 is $254.2 million, or 45.8% of the total District 2014-
15 assessed valuation.

Tax Levies and Delinquencies 

 
The Board of Supervisors of the County has adopted the Alternative Method of Distribution 
of Tax Levies and Collections and of Tax Sale Proceeds (the “Teeter Plan”), as provided for in 
Section 4701 et seq. of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. Under the Teeter Plan, each 
entity levying property taxes in the County may draw on the amount of uncollected secured taxes 
credited to its fund, in the same manner as if the amount credited had been collected.  The District 
participates  in  the  Teeter  Plan,  and  thus  receives  100%  of  secured  property  taxes  levied  in 

-19- 

exchange  for  foregoing  any  interest  and  penalties  collected  on  delinquent  taxes.  Currently,  the 
County includes the District’s general obligation bond levies in its Teeter Plan. 

 
So  long  as  the  Teeter  Plan  remains  in  effect  and  the  County  continues  to  include  the 
District in the Teeter Plan, the District’s receipt of revenues with respect to the levy of ad valorem 
property taxes will not be dependent upon actual collections of the ad valorem property taxes by 
the County.  However, under the statute creating the Teeter Plan, the Board of Supervisors could 
under certain circumstances terminate the Teeter Plan in its entirety and, in addition, the Board of 
Supervisors could terminate the Teeter Plan with respect to the District if the delinquency rate for 
all ad valorem property taxes levied within the District in any year exceeds 3%. On July 15, 2008, 
the  County  adopted  Resolution  No.  08-322,  which  determined  that,  because  the  “…County  of 
Mendocino  Supplemental  Secured  Property  Tax  Roll  is  now  severely  delinquent  and,  by  such 
delinquency, impairs, impedes and disrupts the County of Mendocino’s general fund cash flow…”, 
the  County  discontinued  the  use  of  the  Teeter    Plan  as  it  applies  to  the  supplemental  secured 
property tax rolls.  In the event that the Teeter Plan were terminated with regard to the secured 
tax roll, the amount of the levy of ad valorem property taxes in the District would depend upon the 
collections of the ad valorem property taxes and delinquency rates experienced with respect to 
the parcels within the District.

Concentration of Ownership.  The District derives a portion of its revenues from its share of the 
one percent levy for general purposes.  In addition, the Series C Bonds are secured by the levy 
and collection of voter-approved ad valorem property taxes.  The top twenty property owners in 
the  District  account  for  22.64%  of  the  total  assessed  valuation  in  the  District,  with  the  top  ten 
secured  taxpayers  accounting  for  over  16%  of  the  District’s  secured  assessed  valuation.  
Because the County has adopted the Teeter Plan, whereby taxing entities such as the District are 
paid  the  full  amount  of  taxes  levied  on  their  behalf,  notwithstanding  delinquencies  or  non-
payment, failure by a large property taxpayer in the District to pay property taxers is unlikely to 
have  a  negative  impact  on  the  District’s  tax  collections.    Should  the  County  remove  tax  levies 
such as ad valorem taxes levied for general obligation bonds from the Teeter Plan, or terminate 
the  Teeter  Plan,  the  District’s  receipt  of  its  share  of  property  taxes  could  become  subject  to 
delinquencies, although the District would then be entitled to interest and penalties accruing on 
such delinquencies.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the County is under a statutory duty to levy 
and collect sufficient taxes for payment of the Series C Bonds. 
 
Direct and Overlapping Debt 

 
Set forth below is a direct and overlapping debt report (the “Debt Report”) prepared by 
California  Municipal  Statistics,  Inc.  for  debt  issued  as  of  March  1,  2015.  The  Debt  Report  is 

-21- 

included for general information purposes only. The District has not reviewed the Debt Report for 
completeness or accuracy and makes no representation in connection therewith. 

 
The Debt Report generally includes long-term obligations sold in the public credit markets 
by public agencies whose boundaries overlap the boundaries of the District in whole or in part. 
Such  long-term  obligations  generally  are  not  payable  from  revenues  of  the  District  (except  as 
indicated) nor are they necessarily obligations secured by land within the District. In many cases, 
long-term obligations issued by a public agency are payable only from the general fund or other 
revenues of such public agency.

Bond Insurance Policy 
 

BOND INSURANCE 

Concurrently with the issuance of the Series C Bonds, Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. 
("AGM") will issue its Municipal Bond Insurance Policy for the Series C Bonds (the "Policy").  The 
Policy guarantees the scheduled payment of principal of and interest on the Series C Bonds when 
due as set forth in the form of the Policy included as an exhibit to this Official Statement. 

 
The Policy is not covered by any insurance security or guaranty fund established under 

New York, California, Connecticut or Florida insurance law. 
Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp.  
 

 

AGM  is  a  New  York  domiciled  financial  guaranty  insurance  company  and  an  indirect 
subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. (“AGL”), a Bermuda-based holding company whose shares 
are  publicly  traded  and  are  listed  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  under  the  symbol  “AGO”.  
AGL, through its operating subsidiaries, provides credit enhancement products to the U.S. and 
global public finance, infrastructure and structured finance markets.  Neither AGL nor any of its 
shareholders or affiliates, other than AGM, is obligated to pay any debts of AGM or any claims 
under any insurance policy issued by AGM. 

 
AGM’s  financial  strength  is  rated  “AA”  (stable  outlook)  by  Standard  and  Poor’s  Ratings 
Services, a Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC business (“S&P”), “AA+” (stable outlook) by 
Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. (“KBRA”) and “A2” (stable outlook) by Moody’s Investors Service, 
Inc. (“Moody’s”).  Each rating of AGM should be evaluated independently.  An explanation of the 
significance of the above ratings may be obtained from the applicable rating agency.  The above 
ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any security, and such ratings are subject to 
revision  or  withdrawal  at  any  time  by  the  rating  agencies,  including  withdrawal  initiated  at  the 
request of AGM in its sole discretion.  In addition, the rating agencies may at any time change 
AGM’s long-term rating outlooks or place such ratings on a watch list for possible downgrade in 
the near term.  Any downward revision or withdrawal of any of the above ratings, the assignment 
of a negative outlook to such ratings or the placement of such ratings on a negative watch list may 
have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  market  price  of  any  security  guaranteed  by  AGM.    AGM  only 
guarantees scheduled principal and scheduled interest payments payable by the issuer of bonds 
insured by AGM on the date(s) when such amounts were initially scheduled to become due and 
payable (subject to and in accordance with the terms of the relevant insurance policy), and does 
not guarantee the market price or liquidity of the securities it insures, nor does it guarantee that 
the ratings on such securities will not be revised or withdrawn. 

 

Current Financial Strength Ratings 
 

On November 13, 2014, KBRA assigned an insurance financial strength rating of “AA+” 
(stable outlook) to AGM.  AGM can give no assurance as to any further ratings action that KBRA 
may take. 

 
On  July  2,  2014,  S&P  issued  a  credit  rating  report  in  which  it  affirmed  AGM’s  financial 
strength rating of “AA” (stable outlook).  AGM can give no assurance as to any further ratings 
action that S&P may take. 

-23- 

 
On July 2, 2014, Moody’s issued a rating action report stating that it had affirmed AGM’s 
insurance  financial  strength  rating  of  “A2”  (stable  outlook).    On  February  18,  2015,  Moody’s 
published a credit opinion under its new financial guarantor ratings methodology maintaining its 
existing rating and outlook on AGM.  AGM can give no assurance as to any further ratings action 
that Moody’s may take. 

 
For  more  information  regarding  AGM’s  financial  strength  ratings  and  the  risks  relating 

thereto, see AGL’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. 

Capitalization of AGM 

 

 

 
At  March  31,  2015,  AGM’s  policyholders’  surplus  and  contingency  reserve  were 
approximately $3,730 million and its net unearned premium reserve was approximately $1,702 
million.  Such  amounts  represent  the  combined  surplus,  contingency  reserve  and  net  unearned 
premium reserve of AGM, AGM’s wholly owned subsidiary Assured Guaranty (Europe) Ltd. and 
60.7%  of  AGM’s  indirect  subsidiary  Municipal  Assurance  Corp.;  each  amount  of  surplus, 
contingency  reserve  and  net  unearned  premium  reserve  for  each  company  was  determined  in 
accordance with statutory accounting principles.

Tax Exemption 

TAX MATTERS 

 
Federal Tax Status.  In the opinion of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, San 
Francisco, California, Bond Counsel, subject, however to the qualifications set forth below, under 
existing law, the interest on the Series C Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income 
tax  purposes  and  such  interest  is  not  an  item  of  tax  preference  for  purposes  of  the  federal 
alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  individuals  and  corporations,  although  for  the  purpose  of 
computing  the  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  certain  corporations,  such  interest  is  taken 
into account in determining certain income and earnings. The Series C Bonds are "qualified tax-
exempt  obligations"  within  the  meaning  of  Section  265(b)(3)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of 
1986 (the “Tax Code”) such that, in the case of certain financial institutions (within the meaning of 
section  265(b)(5)  of  the  Code),  a  deduction  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  is  allowed  for  80 
percent of that portion of such financial institution's interest expense allocable to interest payable 
on the Series C Bonds. 

 
The  opinions  set  forth  in  the  preceding  paragraph  are  subject  to  the  condition  that  the 
District  comply  with  all  requirements  of  the  Tax  Code  that  must  be  satisfied  subsequent  to  the 
issuance of the Series C Bonds in order that such interest be, or continue to be, excluded from 
gross income for federal income tax purposes.  The District has covenanted to comply with each 
such requirement.  Failure to comply with certain of such requirements may cause the inclusion of 
such  interest  in  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  to  be  retroactive  to  the  date  of 
issuance  of  the  Series  C  Bonds,  and  may  cause  the  Series  C  Bonds  to  lose  their  status  as 
"qualified tax-exempt obligations" within the meaning of Section 265(b)(3) of the Tax Code. 

 
Bank Qualified.  The Code generally prohibits the deduction of interest on indebtedness 
incurred or continued to purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations, such as the Series C Bonds.  
Banks  and  financial  institutions,  however,  are  permitted  an  80%  deduction  for  their  interest 
expense  allocable  to  “qualified  tax-exempt  obligations”  of  small  governmental  units  (a)  that 
together  with  their  subordinate  entities  or  entities  issuing  on  their  behalf  and  entities  on  whose 
behalf they issue do not reasonably expect to issue in the aggregate more than $10,000,000 of 
tax-exempt obligations (not including private activity bonds other than qualified 501(c)(3) bonds in 
a calendar year), and (b) that designate such obligations as “qualified tax-exempt obligations”.  By 
resolution,  the  District  has  (a)  represented  that  it  expects  that  it  and  all  of  the  above-described 
entities  will  not  issue  in  the  aggregate  more  than  $10,000,000  of  tax-exempt  obligations  during 
calendar year 2015, and (b) designated the Series C Bonds as “qualified tax-exempt obligations”. 

 
Tax Treatment of Original Issue Discount and Premium. If the initial offering price to 
the public (excluding bond houses and brokers) at which a Series C Bond is sold is less than the 
amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference constitutes "original issue discount" 
for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income taxes. If the initial 
offering price to the public (excluding bond houses and brokers) at which a Series C Bond is sold 
is greater than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference constitutes "original 
issue premium" for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income 
taxes.  De minimis original issue discount and original issue premium is disregarded.  

 
Under the Tax Code, original issue discount is treated as interest excluded from federal 
gross income and exempt from State of California personal income taxes to the extent properly 
allocable to each owner thereof subject to the limitations described in the first paragraph of this 
section.  The original issue discount accrues over the term to maturity of the Series C Bond on the 

-26- 

basis  of  a  constant  interest  rate  compounded  on  each  interest  or  principal  payment  date  (with 
straight-line interpolations between compounding dates).  The amount of original issue discount 
accruing during each period is added to the adjusted basis of such Series C Bonds to determine 
taxable gain upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Series 
C  Bond.    The  Tax  Code  contains  certain  provisions  relating  to  the  accrual  of  original  issue 
discount in the case of purchasers of the Series C Bonds who purchase the Series C Bonds after 
the  initial  offering  of  a  substantial  amount  of  such  maturity.    Owners  of  such  Series  C  Bonds 
should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Series 
C Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do not purchase 
in the original offering, the allowance of a deduction for any loss on a sale or other disposition, 
and  the  treatment  of  accrued  original  issue  discount  on  such  Series  C  Bonds  under  federal 
individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes. 

 
Under the Tax Code, original issue premium is amortized on an annual basis over the term 
of the Series C Bond (said term being the shorter of the Series C Bond's maturity date or its call 
date).  The amount of original issue premium amortized each year reduces the adjusted basis of 
the owner of the Series C Bond for purposes of determining taxable gain or loss upon disposition.  
The amount of original issue premium on a Series C Bond is amortized each year over the term to 
maturity  of  the  Series  C  Bond  on  the  basis  of  a  constant  interest  rate  compounded  on  each 
interest or principal payment date (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates).  
Amortized bond premium is not deductible for federal income tax purposes.  Owners of premium 
Series C Bonds, including purchasers who do not purchase in the original offering, should consult 
their own tax advisors with respect to State of California personal income tax and federal income 
tax consequences of owning such Series C Bonds. 

 
California Tax Status.  In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Series C 

Bonds is exempt from California personal income taxes. 

 
Form of Opinion.  A copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is attached 

hereto as Appendix D.  

Other Tax Considerations 
 

Owners of the Series C Bonds should also be aware that the ownership or disposition of, 
or  the  accrual  or  receipt  of  interest  on,  the  Series  C  Bonds  may  have  federal  or  state  tax 
consequences  other  than  as  described  above.    Bond  Counsel  expresses  no  opinion  regarding 
any federal or state tax consequences arising with respect to the Series C Bonds other than as 
expressly described above. 

 
Future legislation, if enacted into law, or clarification of the Tax Code may cause interest 
on the Series C Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation, or otherwise 
prevent owners of the Series C Bonds from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of 
such interest.  The introduction or enactment of any such future legislation or clarification of the 
Tax  Code  may  also  affect  the  market  price  for,  or  marketability  of,  the  Series  C  Bonds.  
Prospective  purchasers  of  the  Series  C  Bonds  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding 
any pending or proposed federal tax legislation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

Legality for Investment 
 

CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS 

Under  provisions  of  the  California  Financial  Code,  the  Series  C  Bonds  are  legal 
investments  for  commercial  banks  in  California  to  the  extent  that  the  Series  C  Bonds,  in  the 
informed  opinion  of  the  bank,  are  prudent  for  the  investment  of  funds  of  depositors,  and  under 
provisions of the California Government Code, the Series C Bonds are eligible to secure deposits 
of public moneys in California. 

 

 

Absence of Litigation 
 

No litigation is pending or threatened concerning the validity of the Series C Bonds, and a 
certificate to that effect will be furnished to purchasers at the time of the original delivery of the 
Series C Bonds. The District is not aware of any litigation pending or threatened that (i) questions 
the political existence of the District, (ii) contests the District's ability to receive ad valorem taxes 
or to collect other revenues or (iii) contests the District's ability to issue and retire the Series C 
Bonds. 
 
The  District  is  routinely  subject  to  lawsuits  and  claims.  In  the  opinion  of  the  District,  the 
aggregate amount of the uninsured liabilities of the District under these lawsuits and claims will 
not materially affect the financial position or operations of the District.

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE 

 

The  District  will  execute  a  Continuing  Disclosure  Certificate  in  connection  with  the 
issuance  of  the  Series  C  Bonds  in  the  form  attached  hereto  as  Appendix  E.    The  District  has 
covenanted  therein,  for  the  benefit  of  holders  and  beneficial  owners  of  the  Series  C  Bonds  to 
provide  certain  financial  information  and  operating  data  relating  to  the  District  to  the  Municipal 
Securities Rulemaking Board (an “Annual Report”) not later than nine months after the end of 
the District’s fiscal year (which currently is June 30), commencing March 31, 2016 with the report 
for  the  2014-15  Fiscal  Year,  and  to  provide  notices  of  the  occurrence  of  certain  enumerated 
events. Such notices will be filed by the District with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.  
The  specific  nature  of  the  information  to  be  contained  in  an  Annual  Report  or  the  notices  of 
enumerated  events  is  set  forth  in  “APPENDIX  E  –  FORM  OF  CONTINUING  DISCLOSURE 
CERTIFICATE.”    These  covenants  have  been  made  in  order  to  assist  the  Underwriter  of  the 
Series C Bonds in complying with S.E.C. Rule 15c2-12(b)(5) (the “Rule”).  

 
The District has prior undertakings pursuant to the Rule.  In the previous five years, the 
District failed to make many filings required by the Rule such as audited financial statements and 
updated  annual  operating  data..  Such  filings  have  since  been  made.    Identification  of  such 
instances of non-compliance does not constitute a representation that such non-compliance was 
material. The District has undertaken training of District staff to act as its own dissemination agent 

-28- 

in the future and is now aware of the requirements under the Rule and will be changing internal 
policies  to  ensure  future  compliance.    The  District  will  serve  as  its  dissemination  agent  with 
respect to all of such undertakings pursuant to the Rule. 

 
Neither the County nor any other entity other than the District shall have any obligation or 
incur  any  liability  whatsoever  with  respect  to  the  performance  of  the  District’s  duties  regarding 
continuing disclosure. 
 
 

RATINGS 

Standard  &  Poor’s  Ratings  Services,  a  Standard  &  Poor’s  Financial  Services  LLC 
business  (“S&P”)  is  expected  to  assign  ratings  of  “AA,”  to  the  Series  C  Bonds,  with  the 
understanding that AGM will issue the Policy with respect to the Series C Bonds at closing.  

 
In addition, S&P has assigned its rating of “A+” to the Series C Bonds.  The District has 
provided certain additional information and materials to S&P (some of which does not appear in 
this  Official  Statement).    Such  rating  reflects  only  the  view  of  S&P  and  explanations  of  the 
significance of such rating may be obtained only from S&P.  There is no assurance that any credit 
ratings given to the Series C Bonds will be maintained for any period of time or that the rating may 
not  be  lowered  or  withdrawn  entirely  by  S&P  if,  in  such  agency’s  judgment,  circumstances  so 
warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of a rating may have an adverse effect on the 
market price of the Series C Bonds.  

 
 

UNDERWRITING 

 

 

The  Series  C  Bonds  are  being  purchased  by  Stifel,  Nicolaus  &  Company,  Incorporated 
(the “Underwriter”).  The Underwriter has agreed to purchase the Series C Bonds at a price of 
$1,252,504.87  which  is  equal  to  the  initial  principal  amount  of  the  Series  C  Bonds  of 
$1,267,414.10,  less  original  issue  discount  of  $3,502.50,  less  an  Underwriter’s  discount  of 
$11,406.73.  The obligations of the Underwriter are subject to certain conditions precedent, and it 
will be obligated to purchase all such Series C Bonds if any Series C Bonds are purchased. The 
Underwriter intends to offer the Series C Bonds to the public initially at the prices and/or yields set 
forth on the cover page of this Official Statement, which prices or yields may subsequently change 
without any requirement of prior notice. 

 
The Underwriter reserves the right to join with dealers and other underwriters in offering 
the Series C Bonds to the public. The Underwriter may offer and sell Series C Bonds to certain 
dealers (including dealers depositing Series C Bonds into investment trusts) at prices lower than 
the  public  offering  prices,  and  such  dealers  may  reallow  any  such  discounts  on  sales  to  other 
dealers.  In  reoffering  Series  C  Bonds  to  the  public,  the  Underwriter  may  overallocate  or  effect 
transactions  which  stabilize  or  maintain  the  market  prices  for  Series  C  Bonds  at  levels  above 
those  which  might  otherwise  prevail.  Such  stabilization,  if  commenced,  may  be  discontinued  at 
any time.

FOR THE ANDERSON VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 

APPENDIX B 

 

 

The  information  in  this  and  other  sections  concerning  the  District's  operations  and 
operating budget is provided as supplementary information only, and it should not be inferred 
from the inclusion of this information in this Official Statement that the principal of or interest on 
the Series C Bonds is payable from the general fund of the District.  The Series C Bonds are 
payable solely from the proceeds of an ad valorem tax required to be levied by the County in an 
amount sufficient for the payment thereof.  See "SECURITY FOR THE SERIES C BONDS" in 
the front half of the Official Statement. 

The District 

 
The District was established on July 1, 1963 and serves the areas in and around the City 
of Boonville in Mendocino County.  The District currently operates one elementary school, one 
junior/senior  high  school  and  one  preschool.      Enrollment  for  fiscal  year  2014-15  is  540 
students. 

 
Anderson Valley is located approximately 150 miles north of San Francisco, between the 
City of Cloverdale on the U.S. Highway 101 corridor to the southeast, and U.S. Highway 1 to the 
West. Highway 128 parallels the Navarro River and travels through the tiny towns of Yorkville, 
Boonville, Philo and Navarro. Only about fifteen miles long, this valley is filled with panoramic 
views  of  apple  orchards,  olive  groves,  grazing  sheep,  vineyards  and  rolling  hills  studded  with 
giant oaks in the southern portion of the valley, giving way to the redwoods in the north. 

 
Historically,  the  valley’s  economy  has  been  dominated  by  the  lumber  industry,  the 
raising  of  sheep,  and  farming.  In  recent  years,  the  addition  of  many  wineries  has  been  a 
growing source of economy for the valley. 

Administration 

 
Board of Education. The District is governed by a five-member Governing Board, with 
each member elected to a four-year term in alternate slates of two and three. Current members 
of the Governing Board, together with their office and the date their current term expires, are

Employee Relations 

 
The  California  Teacher’s  Association  has  been  selected  as  the  bargaining  agent  for 
certificated personnel and the California Schools Employee’s Association has been selected as 
the bargaining agent for classified personnel.  Both contracts will expire on June 30, 2016.   

Risk Management  

 
During fiscal year 2013-14, the District participated in several joint powers agreements 
(“JPAs”)  to  mange  risks  related  to  theft,  damage  and  destruction  of  assets;  errors  and 
omissions, injuries to employees and certain natural disasters.   

 
The  Schools  Insurance  Group  Northern  Alliance  provides  workers’  compensation  and 
property/liability insurance to member districts. The Schools Excess Liability Fund provides self-
funding  and  risk  management  to  member  districts.  The  Mendocino  Stay  Well  Joint  Powers 
Authority provides self-insurance for medical claims to member districts.  

 
The  JPAs  are  governed  by  boards  consisting  of  representatives  from  the  member 
agencies.  The  boards  control  the  operations  of  the  JPAs,  including  selection  of  management 
and  approval  of  operating  budgets.  Each  member  district  pays  premiums  commensurate  with 
the level of coverage or service requested, and shares in surpluses and deficits in proportion to 
participation in the JPA.

DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

 
The  information  in  this  and  other  sections  concerning  the  District's  operations  and 
operating budget is provided as supplementary information only, and it should not be inferred 
from the inclusion of this information in this Official Statement that the principal of or interest on 
the Series B Bonds is payable from the general fund of the District.  The Series B Bonds are 
payable  from  the  proceeds  of  an  ad  valorem  tax  required  to  be  levied  by  the  County  in  an 
amount sufficient for the payment thereof. 

Education Funding Generally 
 

School districts in California receive operating income primarily from two sources:   the 
State  funded  portion  which  is  derived  from  the  State’s  general  fund,  and  a  locally  funded 
portion, being the district’s share of the one percent general ad valorem tax levy authorized by 
the California Constitution.  As a result, decreases or deferrals in education funding by the State 
could significantly affect a school district’s revenues and operations. 

 
From  1973-74  to  2012-13,  California  school  districts  operated  under  general  purpose 
revenue limits established by the State Legislature.  In general, revenue limits were calculated 
for each school district by multiplying (1) the average daily attendance (“ADA”) for such district 
by  (2)  a  base  revenue  limit  per  unit  of  ADA.  The  revenue  limit  calculations  were  adjusted 
annually in accordance with a number of factors designated primarily to provide cost of living 
increases  and  to  equalize  revenues  among  all  California  school  districts  of  the  same  type. 
Funding of the District's revenue limit was provided by a mix of local property taxes and State 
apportionments of basic and equalization aid. Generally, the State apportionments amounted to 
the difference between the District's revenue limit and its local property tax revenues. 

 
The fiscal year 2013-14 State budget package (the “2013-14 State Budget”) replaced 
the  previous  K-12  finance  system  with  a  new  formula  known  as  the  Local  Control  Funding 
Formula (the “LCFF”).  Under the LCFF, revenue limits and most state categorical programs 
were eliminated. School districts instead receive funding based on the demographic profile of 
the students they serve and gain greater flexibility to use these funds to improve outcomes of 
students.  The  LCFF  creates  funding  targets  based  on  student  characteristics.  For  school 
districts  and  charter  schools,  the  LCFF  funding  targets  consist  of  grade  span-specific  base 
grants  plus  supplemental  and  concentration  grants  that  reflect  student  demographic  factors.  
The LCFF includes the following components: 

 

 

 
•  A base grant for each local education agency per unit of ADA, which varies with 
respect  to  different  grade  spans.  The  base  grant  is  $2,375  more  than  the 
average  revenue  limit  provided  prior  to  LCFF  implementation.  The  base  grants 
will be adjusted upward each year to reflect cost-of-living increases. In addition, 
grades K-3 and 9-12 are subject to adjustments of 10.4% and 2.6%, respectively, 
to  cover  the  costs  of  class  size  reduction  in  grades  K-3  and  the  provision  of 
career technical education in grades 9-12. 

 
•  A  20%  supplemental  grant  for  English  learners,  students  from  low-income 
families  and  foster  youth  to  reflect  increased  costs  associated  with  educating 
those students. 

 
•  An  additional  concentration  grant  of  up  to  50%  of  a  local  education  agency’s 
base grant, based on the number of English learners, students from low-income 

B-3 

families  and  foster  youth  served  by  the  local  agency  that  comprise  more  than 
55% of enrollment. 

 
•  An economic recovery target to ensure that almost every local education agency 
receives  at  least  their  pre-recession  funding  level,  adjusted  for  inflation,  at  full 
implementation of the LCFF. 

 
The LCFF was implemented for fiscal year 2013-14 and will be phased in gradually. 
Beginning  in  fiscal  year  2013-14,  an  annual  transition  adjustment  was  required  to  be 
calculated  for  each  school  district,  equal  to  each  district’s  proportionate  share  of  the 
appropriations  included  in  the  State  budget  (based  on  the  percentage  of  each  district’s 
students who are low-income, English learners, and foster youth (“Targeted Students”), to 
close  the  gap  between  the  prior-year  funding  level  and  the  target  allocation  at  full 
implementation  of  LCFF.  In  each  year,  districts  will  have  the  same  proportion  of  their 
respective  funding  gaps  closed,  with  dollar  amounts  varying  depending  on  the  size  of  a 
district’s funding gap. 

 
Based on revenue projections, districts will reach what is referred to as “full funding” 
in eight years, being fiscal year 2020-21.  This projection assumes that the State’s economy 
will improve each year; if the economy falters it could take longer to reach full funding.  

 
The target LCFF amounts for State school districts and charter schools based on grade 

levels and Targeted Students is shown below.

The new legislation included a “hold harmless” provision which provided that a district or 
charter  school  would  maintain  total  revenue  limit  and  categorical  funding  at  least  equal  to  its 
fiscal year 2012-13 level, unadjusted for changes in ADA or cost of living adjustments. 

 
The LCFF includes an accountability component.  Districts are required to increase or 
improve  services  for  English  language  learners,  low  income,  and  foster  youth  students  in 
proportion to supplemental and concentration grant funding received.  All school districts, county 
offices  of  education,  and  charter  schools  are  required  to  develop  and  adopt  local  control  and 
accountability plans, which identify local goals in areas that are priorities for the State, including 
pupil achievement, parent engagement, and school climate. 

 
County  superintendents  review  and  provide  support 

the  districts  under their 
jurisdiction,  and  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  performs  a  corresponding  role  for 
county  offices  of  education.  In  addition,  the  2013-14  State  Budget  created  the  California 
Collaborative  for  Education  Excellence  to  advise  and  assist  school  districts,  county offices  of 

to 

B-4 

 

 

 

education, and charter schools in achieving the goals identified in their plans.  Under the LCFF 
and  related  legislation,  the  State  will  continue  to  measure  student  achievement  through 
statewide assessments, produce an Academic Performance Index for schools and subgroups of 
students, determine the contents of the school accountability report card, and establish policies 
to implement the federal accountability system. 

District Accounting Practices 

 
The  accounting  practices  of  the  District  conform  to  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles  in  accordance  with  policies  and  procedures  of  the  California  School  Accounting 
Manual.  This manual, according to Section 41010 of the California Education Code, is to be 
followed by all California school districts.   

 
District accounting is organized on the basis of fund groups, with each group consisting 
of  a  separate  set  of  self-balancing  accounts  containing  assets,  liabilities,  fund  balances, 
revenues and expenditures.  The major fund classification is the general fund which accounts 
for  all  financial  resources  not  requiring  a  special  fund  placement.    The  District's  fiscal  year 
begins on July 1 and ends on June 30.   

 
District  expenditures  are  accrued  at  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  to  reflect  the  receipt  of 
goods and services in that year.  Revenues generally are recorded on a cash basis, except for 
items  that  are  susceptible  to  accrual  (measurable  and/or  available  to  finance  operations).  
Current taxes are considered susceptible to accrual.  Revenues from specific state and federally 
funded  projects  are  recognized  when  qualified  expenditures  have  been  incurred.    State  block 
grant apportionments are accrued to the extent that they are measurable and predictable.  The 
State  Department  of  Education  sends  the  District  updated  information  from  time  to  time 
explaining the acceptable accounting treatment of revenue and expenditure categories.   

 
The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) published its Statement No. 
34 “Basic Financial Statements – and Management’s Discussion and Analysis – for State and 
Local Governments” on June 30, 1999. Statement No. 34 provides guidelines to auditors, state 
and  local  governments  and  special  purpose  governments  such  as  school  districts  and  public 
utilities, on new requirements for financial reporting for all governmental agencies in the United 
States. Generally, the basic financial statements and required supplementary information should 
include (i) Management’s Discussion and Analysis; (ii) financial statements prepared using the 
economic measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, (iii) fund financial statements 
prepared  using  the  current  financial  resources  measurement  focus  and  the  modified  accrual 
method of accounting and (iv) required supplementary information.   

Financial Statements 

 
General.  The  District's  general  fund  finances  the  legally  authorized  activities  of  the 
District  for  which  restricted  funds  are  not  provided.    General  fund  revenues  are  derived  from 
such sources as State school fund apportionments, taxes, use of money and property, and aid 
from  other  governmental  agencies.    The  District's  Audited  Financial  Statements  for  the  fiscal 
year ending fiscal year 2013-14 were prepared by Nigro & Nigro, A Professional Accountancy 
Corporation, Murrieta, California (the “Auditor”). Audited financial statements for the District for 
the  fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2014,  and  prior  fiscal  years  are  on  file  with  the  District  and 
available  for  public  inspection  at  the  Superintendent’s  Office.  See  Appendix  B  hereto  for  the 
2013-14  Audited  Financial  Statements.  Copies  of  such  financial  statements  will  be  mailed  to 
prospective investors and their representatives upon written request to the District.  The District 

B-5 

 

 

 
 

 

has not requested nor did the District obtain permission from the Auditor to include the audited 
financial statements as an appendix to this Official Statement.  Accordingly, the Auditor has not 
performed any post-audit review of the financial condition or operations of the District. 

General  Fund  Revenues,  Expenditures  and  Changes  in  Fund  Balance.    The

District Budget and Interim Financial Reporting 
 

Budgeting - Education Code Requirements.  The District is required by provisions of 
the  State  Education  Code  to  maintain  a  balanced  budget  each  year,  in  which  the  sum  of 
expenditures and the ending fund balance cannot exceed the sum of revenues and the carry-
over  fund  balance  from  the  previous  year.  The  State  Department  of  Education  imposes  a 
uniform  budgeting  and  accounting  format  for  school  districts.  The  budget  process  for  school 
districts  was  substantially  amended  by  Assembly  Bill  1200  (“AB  1200”),  which  became  State 
law on October 14, 1991. Portions of AB 1200 are summarized below. 

 
School districts must adopt a budget on or before July 1 of each year.  The budget must 
be submitted to the county superintendent within five days of adoption or by July 1, whichever 
occurs first.  A district may be on either a dual or single budget cycle.  The dual budget option 
requires  a  revised  and  readopted  budget  by  September  1  that  is  subject  to  State-mandated 
standards  and  criteria.    The  revised  budget  must  reflect  changes  in  projected  income  and 
expenses subsequent to July 1.  The single budget is only readopted if it is disapproved by the 
county office of education, or as needed.  The District is on a single budget cycle and adopts its 
budget on or before July 1. 

  
For  both  dual  and  single  budgets  submitted  on  July  1,  the  county  superintendent  will 
examine  the  adopted  budget  for  compliance  with  the  standards  and  criteria  adopted  by  the 
State Board of Education and identify technical corrections necessary to bring the budget into 
compliance, will determine if the budget allows the district to meet its current obligations and will 
determine if the budget is consistent with a financial plan that will enable the district to meet its 
multi-year  financial  commitments.    On  or  before  August  15,  the  county  superintendent  will 
approve or disapprove the adopted budget for each school district.  Budgets will be disapproved 
if they fail the above standards.  The district board must be notified by August 15 of the county 
superintendent's  recommendations  for  revision  and  reasons  for  the  recommendations.    The 
county  superintendent  may  assign  a  fiscal  advisor  or  appoint  a  committee  to  examine  and 
comment on the superintendent's recommendations.  The committee must report its findings no 
later than August 20.  Any recommendations made by the county superintendent must be made 
available  by  the  district  for  public  inspection.    The  law  does  not  provide  for  conditional 
approvals;  budgets  must  be  either  approved  or  disapproved.    No  later  than  August  20,  the 
county superintendent must notify the Superintendent of Public Instruction of all school districts 
whose budget has been disapproved. 

 
For all dual budget options and for single and dual budget option districts whose budgets 
have  been  disapproved,  the  district  must  revise  and  readopt  its  budget  by  September  8, 
reflecting changes in projected income and expense since July 1, including responding to the 
county  superintendent's  recommendations.    The  county  superintendent  must  determine  if  the 
budget conforms with the standards and criteria applicable to final district budgets and not later 
than October 8, will approve or disapprove the revised budgets.  If the budget is disapproved, 
the county superintendent will call for the formation of a budget review committee pursuant to 
Education Code Section 42127.1.  Until a district's budget is approved, the district will operate 
on the lesser of its proposed budget for the current fiscal year or the last budget adopted and 
reviewed for the prior fiscal year. 

 
Interim  Certifications Regarding Ability to Meet Financial Obligations.    Under  the 
provisions of AB 1200, each school district is required to file interim certifications with the county 
office of education as to its ability to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the then-
current  fiscal  year  and,  based  on  current  forecasts,  for  the  subsequent  two  fiscal  years.  The 

B-7 

 

 

county  office  of  education  reviews  the  certification  and  issues  either  a  positive,  negative  or 
qualified certification. A positive certification is assigned to any school district that will meet its 
financial  obligations  for  the  current  fiscal  year  and  subsequent  two  fiscal  years.  A  negative 
certification is assigned to any school district that will be unable to meet its financial obligations 
for the remainder of the fiscal year or subsequent fiscal year. A qualified certification is assigned 
to  any  school  district  that  may  not  meet  its  financial  obligations  for  the  current  fiscal  year  or 
subsequent two fiscal years. 

 
Under California law, any school district and office of education that has a qualified or 
negative  certification  in  any  fiscal  year  may  not  issue,  in  that  fiscal  year  or  in  the  next 
succeeding fiscal year, certificates of participation, tax anticipation notes, revenue bonds or any 
other debt instruments that do not require the approval of the voters of the district, unless the 
applicable  county  superintendent  of  schools  determines  that  the  district’s  repayment  of 
indebtedness is probable. 

 
District’s  Budget  Approval/Disapproval  and  Certification  History.  During  the  past 
five  years,  each  of  the  District’s  adopted  budgets  have  been  approved  by  the  County 
Superintendent and the District has received positive certifications on all of its interim reports.  

 
Copies of the District’s budget, interim reports and certifications may be obtained upon 
request  from  the  District  Office  at  Anderson  Valley  Unified  School  District,  12300  Anderson 
Valley  Way,  Boonville,  CA    95415;  (707)  895-3774.  The  District  may  impose  charges  for

Assumptions Used with Respect to 2014-15 Budget.  The District’s fiscal year 2014-
15  Budget  was  adopted  on  June  25,  2014.    The  budget  development  takes  into  account  the 
Governor’s May Revision of the proposed 2015-16 State Budget. See “STATE FUNDING OF 
EDUCATION; RECENT STATE BUDGETS.“ 

 
District Reserves.  The District’s ending fund balance is the accumulation of surpluses 
from prior years.  This fund balance is used to meet the State’s minimum required reserve of 3% 
of  expenditures,  plus  any  other  allocation  or  reserve  which  might  be  approved  as  an 
expenditure by the District in the future. Pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board, a formal 
economic reserve policy established a minimum 4% reserve level for the District. Consequently, 
the District maintains an unrestricted reserve which exceeds the State’s minimum requirements. 

 
In connection with legislation adopted in connection with the State’s fiscal year 2014-15 
Budget (“SB 858”), the Education Code was amended to provide that, beginning in fiscal year 
2015-16,  if  a  district’s  proposed  budget  includes  a  local  reserve  above  the  minimum 
recommended level, the governing board must provide the information for review at the annual 

B-9 

 

 

 

public hearing on its proposed budget. In addition, SB 858 included a provision which limits the 
amount of reserves which may be maintained at the District level.  This proposed reserve fund 
“cap”  was  conditioned  on  the  success  of  Proposition  2  on  the  November  4,  2014  statewide 
ballot,  which  was  approved  by  voters.      The  District  cannot  predict  how  this  legislation  will 
impact  its  reserves  and  future  spending.  See  “STATE  FUNDING  OF  EDUCATION;  RECENT 
STATE BUDGETS- 2014-15 State Budget.” 

Attendance - Revenue Limit and LCFF Funding 

 
As  described  herein,  prior  to  fiscal  year  2013-14,  school  districts  in  California  derived 
most  State  funding  based  on  a  formula  which  considered  a  revenue  limit  per  unit  of  average 
daily  attendance  (“ADA”).  With  the  implementation  of  the  LCFF,  commencing  in  fiscal  year 
2013-14,  school  districts  receive  base  funding  based  on  ADA,  and  may  also  be  entitled  to 
supplemental funding, concentration grants and funding based on an economic recovery target.  
The following two tables set forth historical revenue limit funding for the District through fiscal 
year  2012-13,  and  LCFF  funding  for  the  District  for  fiscal  year  2013-14  through  2015-15 
(Budgeted).

Revenue Sources 

 
The  District  categorizes  its  general  fund  revenues  into  four  sources,  being  LCFF, 
Federal  Revenues,  Other  State  Revenues  and  Local  Revenues.    Each  of  these  revenue 
sources is described below. 

 
LCFF Sources.  District funding is provided by a mix of (1) local property taxes and (2) 
State  apportionments  of  funding  under  the  LCFF.    Generally,  the  State  apportionments  will 
amount to the difference between the District's LCFF funding entitlement and its local property 
tax revenues. 

 
Beginning  in  fiscal  year  1978-79,  Proposition  13  and  its  implementing  legislation 
provided for each county to levy (except for levies to support prior voter-approved indebtedness) 
and collect all property taxes, and prescribed how levies on county-wide property values are to 
be shared with local taxing entities within each county. 

 
The principal component of local revenues is the school district’s property tax revenues, 
i.e.,  the  district’s  share  of  the  local  1%  property  tax,  received  pursuant  to  Sections  75  and 
following  and  Sections  95  and  following  of  the  California  Revenue  and  Taxation  Code.  
Education  Code  Section  42238(h)  itemizes  the  local  revenues  that  are  counted  towards  the 
base  revenue  limit  before  calculating  how  much  the  State  must  provide  in  equalization  aid.  
Historically, the more local property taxes a district received, the less State equalization aid it is 
entitled to. 

 
Federal  Revenues.  The  federal  government  provides  funding  for  several  District 
programs,  including  special  education  programs,  programs  under  No  Child  Left  Behind,  the 
Individuals  With  Disabilities  Education  Act,  and  specialized  programs  such  as  Drug  Free 
Schools.  

 
Other State Revenues.  As discussed above, the District receives State apportionment 
of basic and equalization aid in an amount equal to the difference between the District's revenue 
limit  and  its  property  tax  revenues.    In  addition  to  such  apportionment  revenue,  the  District 
receives other State revenues. 

 

 

B-11 

The  District  receives  State  aid  from  the  California  State  Lottery  (the  "Lottery"),  which 
was  established  by  a  constitutional  amendment  approved  in  the  November  1984  general 
election. Lottery revenues must be used for the education of students and cannot be used for 
non-instructional  purposes  such  as  real  property  acquisition,  facility  construction,  or  the 
financing  of  research.    Moreover,  State  Proposition  20  approved  in  March  2000  requires  that 
50% of the increase in Lottery revenues over fiscal year 1997-98 levels must be restricted to 
use on instruction material. 

 
For  additional  discussion  of  State  aid  to  school  districts,  see  “-State  Funding  of 

Education.” 

 
Other  Local  Revenues.    In  addition  to  local  property  taxes,  the  District  receives 

additional local revenues from items such as interest earnings and other local sources. 
 
District Retirement Systems 

 
Qualified employees are covered under multiple-employer defined benefit pension plans 
maintained by agencies of the State of California.  Certificated employees are members of the 
State  Teachers'  Retirement  System  (“STRS”)  and  classified  employees  are  members  of  the 
Public Employees' Retirement System (“PERS”). 

 
STRS.  All full-time certificated employees participate in STRS, a cost-sharing, multiple-
employer  contributory  public  employee  retirement  system.    The  plan  provides  retirement  and 
disability  benefits  and  survivor  benefits  to  beneficiaries.  Benefit  provisions  are  established  by 
State statutes, as legislatively amended, within the State Teacher’s Retirement Law.  Due to the 
implementation  of  the  Public  Employee  Pension  Reform  Act  of  2013  (“PEPRA”)  (see  below 
summary),  new  members  must  pay  at  least  50%  of  the  normal  costs  of  the  plan,  which  can 
fluctuate  from  year  to  year.    For  2013-14,  the  required  contribution  rate  for  new  members  is 
8.0%. "Classic" plan members are also required to contribute 8.0% of their salary. The District is 
required to contribute an actuarially determined rate.  The actuarial methods and assumptions 
used for determining the rate are those adopted by the STRS Teachers' Retirement Board.  The 
required  employer  contribution  rate  for  fiscal  year  2013-14  was  8.25%  of  annual  payroll.  The 
contribution requirements of the plan members are established by State statute.  The District’s 
contributions to STRS for the past three and current budgeted fiscal years are set forth in the 
following table.  These contributions represent 100% of the required contribution for each year.

New  Legislation  Regarding  STRS  Contributions  Implemented  in  FY  2014-15.    In 
connection with the State’s adoption of its fiscal year 2014-15 Budget, the Governor signed into 
law  Assembly  Bill  1469  (“AB  1469”),  which  represents  a  legislative  effort  to  address  the 
unfunded  liabilities  of  the  STRS  pension  plan  (see  below  section  entitled  “State  Pension

PERS.    All  full-time  and  some  part-time  classified  employees  participate  in  PERS,  an 
agent multiple-employer contributory public employee retirement system that acts as a common 
investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State of California.  
The District is part of a "cost-sharing" pool within PERS.  As a result of the implementation of 
PEPRA,  new  members  must  pay  at  least  50%  of  the  normal  costs  of  the  plan,  which  can 
fluctuate from year to year.  For 2013-14, the normal cost is 11.85%, which rounds to a 6.0% 
contribution rate. "Classic" plan members continue to contribute 7.0%.  The District is required 
to contribute an actuarially determined rate.  The actuarial methods and assumptions used for 
determining  the  rate  are  those  adopted  by  the  PERS  Board  of  Administration.    The  required 
employer  contribution  rate  for  fiscal  year  2013-14  was  11.442%  of  covered  payroll.    The 
contribution requirements of the plan members are established by State statute.  The District’s 
contributions to PERS for the past three and current projected fiscal years are set forth in the 
following table.  These contributions represent 100% of the required contribution for each year 

Trusts”).    AB  1469  addresses  the  funding  gap  by  increasing  contributions  of  plan  members, 
employers (including the District) and the State commencing in fiscal year 2014-15.  Pursuant to 
AB 1469, employer contribution rates to the STRS plan will increase over the next seven years, 
from  the  contribution  rate  of  8.25%  in  fiscal  year  2013-14  to  19.1%  in  fiscal  year  2020-21.  
Thereafter,  employer  contribution  rates  will  be  determined  by  the  STRS  board  to  reflect  the 
contribution  required  to  eliminate  unfunded  liabilities  by  June  30,  2046.    STRS  employer 
contribution rates under AB 1469 for fiscal years 2014-15 through 2020-21 are summarized in 
the following table.

PERS Board Adopts New Employer Contribution Rates.  On April 16, 2014, the Board of 
Administration of PERS (the “PERS Board”) approved new contribution rates beginning on July 
1, 2014.  School district employer contribution rates will reflect new demographic assumptions 

B-13 

and  other  changes  in  actuarial  assumptions  which  were  adopted  by  the  PERS  Board  in 
February  2014.    The  new  assumptions,  which  are  aimed  eliminating  the  unfunded  liability  of 
PERS in approximately 30 years, will be implemented for school districts beginning in fiscal year 
2016-17, with the costs spread over twenty years and the increases phased in over the first five 
years.    These  new  employer  contribution  rates  continue  to  recognize  asset  losses  from  prior 
years.  Projected employer contribution rates for school districts are as follows:

State  Pensions  Trusts.    Both  the  PERS  and  STRS  systems  are  operated  on  a 
statewide basis.  District contribution rates to PERS can vary annually depending on changes in 
actuarial assumptions and other factors, such as liability.  Contributions to STRS can only be 
changed  legislatively.   Both  PERS  and  STRS  have  substantial  State  unfunded  actuarial 
liabilities,  being  $49.5  billion  for  PERS  as  of  June  30,  2013  (the  date  of  the  last  actuarial 
valuation  for  PERS)  and  $73.7  billion  for  STRS  as  of  June  30,  2013  (the  date  of  the  last 
actuarial valuation for STRS).  As described above, AB 1469 was enacted in connection with 
the State’s 2014-15 Budget in an attempt to reduce and eliminate the unfunded liability of the 
STRS  pension  plan,  and  the  PERS  Board  has  recently  taken  actions  to  increase  contribution 
rates in order to address unfunded liabilities. 

 
Both  STRS  and  PERS  issue  separate  comprehensive  financial  reports  that  include 
financial  statements  and  required  supplemental  information.    Copies  of  such  reports  may  be 
obtained  from  STRS  and  PERS,  respectively,  as  follows:    (i)    STRS,  P.O.  Box  15275,

Pension Reform Act of 2013 (Assembly Bill 340).  On September 12, 2012, Governor 
Brown signed AB 340, enacting the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 
(“PEPRA”) and amending various sections of the California Education and Government Codes.  
AB  340  (i)  increased  the  retirement  age  for  new  State,  school,  and  city  and  local  agency 
employees depending on job function, (ii) capped the annual PERS and STRS pension benefit 
payouts, (iii) addressed numerous abuses of the system, and (iv) required State, school, and 
certain city and local agency employees to pay at least half of the costs of their PERS pension 
benefits.    PEPRA  applies  to  all  public  employers  except  the  University  of  California,  charter 
cities and charter counties (except to the extent they contract with PERS.) 

 
The provisions of AB 340 went into effect on January 1, 2013 with respect to new State, 
school, and city and local agency employees hired on that date and after; existing employees 
who are members of employee associations, including employee associations of the Districts, 
have a five-year window to negotiate compliance with AB 340 through collective bargaining.  If 
no  deal  is  reached  by  January  1,  2018,  a  city,  public  agency  or  school  district  could  force 
employees  to  pay  their  half  of  the  costs  of  PERS  pension  benefits,  up  to  8%  of  pay  for  civil 
workers and 11% or 12% for public safety workers.

PERS has predicted that the impact of AB 340 on employees and employers, including 
the  Districts  and  other  employers  in  the  STRS  system,  will  vary,  based  on  each  employer’s 
current level of benefits. To the extent that the new formulas lower retirement benefits, employer 
contribution rates could decrease over time as current employees retire and employees subject 
to the new formulas make up a larger percentage of the workforce. This change would, in some 
circumstances,  result  in  a  lower  retirement  benefit  for  employees  than  they  currently  earn.  
Additionally,  PERS  has  noted  that  changes  arising  from  AB  340  could  ultimately  have  an 
adverse  impact  on  public  sector  recruitment  in  areas  that  have  historically  experienced 
recruitment challenges due to higher pay for similar jobs in the private sector. 

 
With respect to STRS, the provisions of AB 1469 effective as of July 1, 2014 effectively 

addressed the contribution requirements of STRS members, employers and the State.

Other Post-Employment Retirement Benefits 

 
The District does not currently provide other post-employment benefits to retirees. 
 

Long-Term Debt 

 
General Obligation Bonds.  Pursuant to the Authorization received at the June 8, 2010 

election, the District has outstanding: 

 

 

 

 

 

•  $2,200,000  Taxable  Direct-Pay  New  Clean  Renewable  Energy  General 
Obligation  Bonds,  2010  Election,  Series  A  (the  “Series  A  Bonds”),  currently 
outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $1,900,000, and 

•  $4,223,484.70 General Obligation Bonds, 2010 Election, Series B-1 (the “Series 
B-1  Bonds”)  currently  outstanding  in  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of 
$4,181,635.90 (not including accrued interest). 

 

The Series A Bonds and the Series B-1 Bonds are payable from ad valorem taxes levied 
on  taxable  parcels  in  the  District.  In  addition,  the  Series  A  Bonds  are  further secured  by  and 
payable  from  the  “Refundable  Credit  Payments”  described  in  this  paragraph.  The  District  has 
designated the Series A Bonds as “New Clean Renewable Energy Bonds” under Section 54C of 
the  Tax  Code  and  intends  that  the  Series  A  Bonds  be  “Specified  Tax  Credit  Bonds”  under 
Section 6431(f) of the Tax Code which makes the District eligible for the credit payable from the 
United States Treasury.  Although the District has pledged the Refundable Credit Payments to 
the  Series  A  Bonds,  the  District  has  covenanted  to  cause  the  County  to  levy  sufficient  ad 
valorem taxes in the District to provide for the payment of principal of and interest on the Series 
A  Bonds.    Therefore,  in  the  event  the  Refundable  Credit  Payments  are  not  received  and 
deposited in the Debt Service Fund, the County will be required to levy ad valorem taxes in an 
amount sufficient to pay the full amount of debt service on the Series A Bonds.

Investment of District Funds 

 
In  accordance  with  Government  Code  Section  53600  et  seq.,  the  Mendocino  County 
Treasurer  manages  funds  deposited  with  it  by  the  District.    The  County  is  required  to  invest 
such funds in accordance with California Government Code Sections 53601 et seq.  In addition, 
counties  are  required  to  establish  their  own  investment  policies  which  may  impose  limitations 
beyond those required by the Government Code.  See “APPENDIX H - MENDOCINO COUNTY 
INVESTMENT POLICY.” 
 
Effect of State Budget on Revenues  

 
Public school districts in California are dependent on revenues from the State for a large 
portion of their operating budgets.  California school districts generally receive the majority of 
their operating revenues from various State sources.  The primary source of funding for school 
districts is the revenue limit, which is a combination of State funds and local property taxes (see 
“—State  Funding  of  Education  –  Revenue  Limits”  above).    State  funds  typically  make  up  the 
majority  of  a  district’s  revenue  limit.    School  districts  also  receive  funding  from  the  State  for 
various categorical programs.   

 
The  availability  of  State  funds  for  public  education  is  a  function  of  constitutional 
provisions  affecting  school  district  revenues  and  expenditures  (see  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND 
STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT  REVENUES  AND  APPROPRIATIONS” 
below), the condition of the State economy (which affects total revenue available to the State 
general fund), and the annual State budget process.

STATE FUNDING OF EDUCATION; RECENT STATE BUDGETS 

 
State Funding of Education 

 

 

 
General.  The State requires that from all State revenues there first shall be set apart 
the moneys to be applied for support of the public school system and public institutions of higher 
education.  Public school districts in California are dependent on revenues from the State for a 
large portion of their operating budgets.  California school districts receive an average of about 
55% of their operating revenues from various State sources.  The primary source of funding for 
school  districts  is  funding  under  the  LCFF,  which  is  a  combination  of  State  funds  and  local 
property  taxes  (see  “DISTRICT  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION  –  Education  Funding  Generally” 
above).  State funds typically make up the majority of a district’s LCFF entitlement   

 
The  availability  of  State  funds  for  public  education  is  a  function  of  constitutional 
provisions  affecting  school  district  revenues  and  expenditures  (see  “CONSTITUTIONAL  AND 
STATUTORY  PROVISIONS  AFFECTING  DISTRICT  REVENUES  AND  APPROPRIATIONS” 
below), the condition of the State economy (which affects total revenue available to the State 
general  fund),  and  the  annual  State  budget  process.    Decreases  in  State  revenues  may 
significantly affect appropriations made by the legislature to school districts. 

 
The following information concerning the State’s budgets for the current and most recent 
preceding years has been compiled from publicly-available information provided by the State.  
Neither the District, the County, nor the Underwriter is responsible for the information relating to 
the  State’s  budgets  provided  in  this  section.    Further  information  is  available  from  the  Public 
Finance Division of the State Treasurer’s Office. 

 
The Budget Process. The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30.  
The annual budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal 
year  (the  “Governor’s  Budget”).    Under  State  law,  the  annual  proposed  Governor’s  Budget 
cannot  provide  for  projected  expenditures  in  excess  of  projected  revenues  and  balances 
available  from  prior  fiscal  years.    Following  the  submission  of  the  Governor’s  Budget,  the 
Legislature takes up the proposal. 

 
Under the State Constitution, money may be drawn from the State Treasury only through 
an appropriation made by law.  The primary source of the annual expenditure authorizations is 
the Budget Act as approved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor.  The Budget Act 
must  be  approved  by  a  majority  vote  of  each  house  of  the  Legislature.    The  Governor  may 
reduce or eliminate specific line items in the Budget Act or any other appropriations bill without 
vetoing the entire bill.  Such individual line-item vetoes are subject to override by a two-thirds 
majority vote of each House of the Legislature. 

 
Appropriations  also  may  be  included  in  legislation  other  than  the  Budget  Act.    Bills 
containing appropriations (including for K-14 education) must be approved by a majority vote in 
each house of the Legislature, unless such appropriations require tax increases, in which case 
they must be approved by a two-thirds vote of each house of the Legislature, and be signed by 
the  Governor.  Continuing  appropriations,  available  without  regard  to  fiscal  year,  may  also  be 
provided by statute or the State Constitution. 

 
Funds necessary to meet an appropriation need not be in the State Treasury at the time 

such appropriation is enacted; revenues may be appropriated in anticipation of their receipt.

Prior Years’ Budgeting Techniques.    Declining  revenues  and  fiscal  difficulties  which 
arose in the State commencing in fiscal year 2008-09 led the State to undertake a number of 
budgeting strategies, which had subsequent impacts on local agencies within the State.  These 
techniques included the issuance of IOUs in lieu of warrants (checks), the enactment of statutes 
deferring amounts owed to public schools, until a later date in the fiscal year, or even into the 
following fiscal year (known as statutory deferrals), trigger reductions, which were budget cutting 
measures which were implemented or could have been implemented if certain State budgeting 
goals were not met, among others, and the dissolution of local redevelopment agencies in part 
to make available additional funding for local agencies.  Although the fiscal year 2014-15 State 
Budget  is  balanced  and  projects  a  balanced  budget  for  the  foreseeable  future,  largely 
attributable to the additional revenues generated due to the passage of Proposition 30 at the 
November 2, 2012 statewide election, there can be no certainty that budget-cutting strategies 
such as those used in recent years will not be used in the future should the State Budget again 
be stressed and if projections included in such budget do not materialize. 

 
2013-14  State  Budget:    Significant  Change  in  Education  Funding.      As  described 
previously  herein,  the  2013-14  State  Budget  and  its  related  implementing  legislation  enacted 
significant  reforms  to  the  State’s  system  of  K-12  education  finance  with  the  enactment  of  the 
LCFF.    Significant  reforms  such  as  the  LCFF  and  other  changes  in  law  may  have  significant 
impacts on the District’s finances. 

2014-15 Adopted State Budget 

 
On  June  20,  2014,  Governor  Brown  approved  the  2014-15  Budget  Act  (the  “2014-15 
Budget”), projecting $108 billion in general fund revenues, which is $7.3 million more in general 
fund  revenues  than  in  fiscal  year  2013-14.    The  2014-15  Budget  is  balanced  and  projects 
paying  down  more  than  $10  billion  in  unprecedented  amounts  of  budgetary  debt  from  past 
years, including paying down deferral of payments to schools by $5 billion, paying off Economic 
Recovery  Bonds,  repaying  various  special  fund  loans,  and  funding  $100  million  in  mandate 
claims that have been owed to local governments since 2004. The budgetary deficit is projected 
to be reduced to below $5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2016-17.  The fiscal year begins with 
a 2014-15 State Budget reserve of $2 billion dollars, including $1.6 billion in the State’s Budget 
Stabilization Account, also known as the State’s rainy day fund.  Temporary revenues provided 

B-18 

by the passage of Proposition 30 (Sales and Income Tax Revenue Increase approved by State 
voters at an election held on November 6, 2012) and spending cuts have allowed for continued 
economic  growth  in  the  State.    The  2014-15  State  Budget  also  contains  triggers  allowing  for 
additional spending, if various revenue benchmarks are exceeded.  If revenues surpass certain 
estimates, then the 2014-15 Budget calls for more funds to be applied to higher education and 
to pay down debt. Certain highlights of the 2014-15 Budget are described below. 

 
Plan  for  Reducing  STRS  Unfunded  Liability.    The  California  State  Teachers’ 
Retirement System (“STRS”) has funded significant unfunded liability. Without changes to how 
the system is funded, STRS is expected to run out of money in about 33 years. To prevent this, 
the 2014-15 Budget sets forth a plan that shares responsibility among the school districts, the 
State, and teachers to better fund STRS. Increased contributions for the first year from all three 
of  these  sources  will  total  $275  million.  Contributions  will  increase  in  subsequent  years, 
reaching more than $5 billion annually.  This plan is projected to eliminate unfunded liability by 
2046.  

 
Constitutional Amendment on November, 2014 Ballot:  Rainy Day Fund.  The 2014-
15 State Budget included a proposed constitutional amendment which was placed before State 
voters on November 4, 2014.  The measure was approved by voters, resulting in a change to 
the  State’s  previously  existing  requirements  for  the  Budget  Stabilization  Account,  the  State’s 
existing rainy day account.  This amendment: 

Requires  deposits  into  the  Rainy  Day  Fund  whenever  capital 
gains  revenues  rise  to  more  than  8%  of  general  fund  tax 
revenues,  and  would  set  the  maximum  size  of  the  Rainy  Day 
Fund at 10% of State general fund revenues. 

Requires  half  of  each  year’s  deposit  for  the  next  15  years  be 
used  for  supplemental  payments  of  debt  or  other  long-term 
liabilities. 

Allows for withdrawal of funds only for a disaster or if spending 
remains at or below the highest level of spending from the past 
three  years.  The  maximum  amount  that  could  be  withdrawn  in 
the first year of a recession would be limited to half of the Rainy 
Day Fund’s balance. 

Requires  that  the  State  provide  a  multiyear  budget  forecast  to 
better manage the State’s long-term finances. 

Creates  a  Proposition  98  reserve,  known  as  the  Public  School 
System Stabilization Account, where spikes in funding would be 
saved  for  future  years.  This  is  intended  to  smooth  school 
spending and minimize future cuts to education funding.

In  addition,  approval  of  this  amendment  had  the  effect  of  enacting  a  related  trailer  bill 
(SB  858),  which

42127.01, operative December 15, 2014, and provides that in any fiscal year immediately after 
a  fiscal  year  in  which  a  transfer  is  made  to  the  Public  School  System  Stabilization  Account 
(referenced in the last bullet point above), a school district may not adopt a budget that contains

a reserve for economic uncertainties in excess of twice the applicable minimum recommended 
reserve for economic uncertainties established by the State Board (for school districts with ADA 
over 400,000, the limit is three times the amount).  Exemptions can be granted by the County 
Superintendent  under  certain  circumstances.   AB  146  is  currently  pending  in  the  California 
legislature, which would repeal Education Code Section 42127.01. 

 
K - 12 Budget Adjustments. The 2014-15 State Budget includes total funding of $76.6 
billion ($45.3 billion general fund and $31.3 billion other funds) for all K-12 education programs. 
Proposition 98 funding has contributed $10 billion to the total funding amount and the fiscal year 
2014-15 State Budget provides $1,954 more per K-12 student in 2014-15 than was provided in 
fiscal year 2011-12. The 2014-15 State Budget also provides $4.7 billion for the second year of 
implementing the LCFF and continues to commit most new funding to districts serving English 
language learners, students from low-income families, and youth in foster care. The Education 
Budget Trailer Bill (“SB 858”) is included in the 2014-15 State Budget and contains two separate 
provisions that have the potential to affect district reserve funds.  In addition, the 2014-15 State 
Budget includes the following:  

•  Local Control Funding Formula. The 2014-15 State Budget contains an increase 
of $4.75 billion in the Proposition 98 funding to continue the State’s transition to 
the LCFF. This increase will close the remaining funding implementation gap by

the  2014-15  State  Budget  addresses  an 
administrative problem related to the collection of income eligibility forms that are 
used to determine student eligibility for free or reduced-price meals.  

than  29%.  Additionally, 

•  K-12  Deferrals.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  repays  nearly  $4.7  billion  in 
Proposition 98 funding for K-12 expenses that had been deferred from one year 
to the next during the past few years. This repayment will leave an outstanding 
balance  of  less  than  $900  million  in  K-12  deferrals.  The  2014-15  State  Budget 
also  contains  a  trigger  mechanism  that  will  appropriate  any  additional  funding 
resources attributable to the 2013-14 and 2014-15 fiscal years subsequent to the 
enactment of the 2014-15 State Budget for the purpose of retiring the remaining 
$900 million in K-12 deferrals.  

 

 

 

 

 

• 

Independent  Study.  The  2014-15  State  Budget  reduces  administrative  burdens 
and  frees  up  time  for  teachers  to  spend  on  student  instruction  and  support, 
making  it  easier  for  schools  to  offer  and  expand  instructional  opportunities 
available to students through non-classroom based instruction.  

•  K-12 Mandates. The 2014-15 State Budget provides $400.5 million in one-time 
Proposition 98 funding to reimburse K-12 local educational agencies for the costs 
of state-mandated programs. These funds will make a significant down payment 
on outstanding mandate debt, while providing school districts, county offices of 
education,  and  charter  schools  with  discretionary  resources  to  support  critical 
investments such as Common Core implementation.  

•  K-12 High-Speed Internet Access. The 2014-15 State Budget increases the one-
time Proposition 98 funding for the K-12 High Speed Network by $26.7 million.

Higher Education and Healthcare. The 2014-15 State Budget includes total funding of 
$26.2 billion ($14.7 billion general fund and local property tax and $11.5 billion other funds). It 
also provides for up to a 20% increase in general fund appropriations over a four-year period. 
The  2014-15  Budget  includes  a  5%  increase  in  2014-15  for  each  university  system,  which 
equals $284 million total. Regarding healthcare, the State’s adoption of the optional expansion 
of  Medi-Cal  under  the  federal  law  known  as  the  Affordable  Care  Act  created  major  new 
spending commitments. The 2014-15 Budget assumes an additional Medi-Cal caseload of 2.5 
million individuals and a rise in costs of $2.4 billion over fiscal year 2012-13.   

 
Emergency Drought Response. On January 17, 2014, Governor Brown proclaimed a 
state  of  emergency  due  to  the  severe  drought  conditions  faced  by  the  State.  Legislation  was 
enacted in February which provided $687.4 million to support drought relief. The 2014-15 State 
Budget  includes  additional  one-time  resources  to  continue  immediate  drought-related  efforts 
started in 2014, such as an increase of $53.8 million from the State’s general fund and $12.2 
million  other  funds  for  firefighting  efforts,  and  an  increase  of  $18.1  million  from  the  State’s 
general fund to aid in assessing water conditions and provide public outreach regarding water 
conservation.   

 
Numerous Factors Affecting Budget and Projections. The execution of the 2014-15 
State Budget may be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to: (i) shifts of costs 
from  the  federal  government  to  the  State,  (ii)  national,  State  and  international  economic 
conditions,  (iii)  litigation  risk  associated  with  spending  reductions,  including  the  elimination  of 
redevelopment  agencies,  (iv)  rising  health  care  costs  (v)  large  unfunded  liabilities  for  retired 
State  employee’s  pensions  and  healthcare,  (vi)  deferred  maintenance  of  State’s  critical 
infrastructure and (vii) other factors, all or any of which could cause the revenue and spending 
projections made in 2014-15 State Budget  to be unattainable. The District cannot predict the 
impact that the 2014-15 State Budget, or subsequent budgets, will have on its own finances and 
operations.  Additionally, the District cannot predict the accuracy of any projections made in the 
State’s 2014-15 State Budget.  

 
The  complete  2014-15  State  Budget  is  available  from  the  California  Department  of 
Finance  website  at  www.dof.ca.gov.    The  District  can  take  no  responsibility  for  the  continued

California Spending Plan.  In October 2014 the Legislative Analyst’s Office released its 
California  Spending  Plan  (a  publication  summarizing  the  State’s  current  spending  plan, 
including  legislative  and  gubernatorial  action  through  October  2014).  The  Spending  Plan 
reports, among other things:  

•  Career  Technical  Education  Pathways  Program.  The  2014-15  State  Budget 
increases  by  $250  million  the  one-time  Proposition  98  funding  to  support  a 
second  cohort  of  competitive  grants  for  participating  K-12  local  educational 
agencies.  Established  in  the  2013  Budget  Act,  the  Career  Pathways  Trust 
Program  provides  grant  awards  to  improve  career  technical  programs  and 
linkages between employers, schools and community colleges.  

•  The State General Fund and Education Protection Fund are $107 billion 

in 2014-15 (an increase of nearly 5% over the prior year’s levels).

•  The State’s 2014-15 fiscal year is projected to end with $2.1 billion in total 

reserves. 

•  The  2014-15  Proposition  98  minimum  guarantee  is  up  $2.6  billion  over 

the revised 2013-14 levels. 

• 

In 2014-15, $5.2 billion in outstanding K-14 deferrals and $450 million in 
outstanding education mandates are expected to be paid down.  

•  An  expected  $4.7  billion  in  additional  funding  for  LCFF  implementation 
(12%  higher  than  the  2013-14  level,  and  sufficient  to  close  29%  of  the 
funding gap). 

 
These  gains  are  largely  due  to  modest  revenue  growth  assumed  in  2014-15  from 
personal income taxes, sales and use taxes, and corporation taxes.  The complete California

2015-16 Proposed State Budget 

 
On  January  9,  2015,  Governor  Brown  presented  his  proposed  budget  for  the  2015-16 
Fiscal  Year  (the  “2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget”).    The  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget 
proposes  a  multiyear  plan  that  is  balanced,  maintains  a  $3.4  billion  reserve,  and  pays  down 
budgetary debt from past years.  Under the 2015-16 Proposed State Budget, funding levels for 
the  K-12  [Local  Control  Funding  Formula  (“LCFF”)]  will  increase  by  $4  billion  to  $13,462  per 
pupil,  and  funding  levels  for  workforce  education  and  training  will  increased  by  $876  million.  
Funding is also increased for the University of California and California State University higher 
education  systems.    The  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget  includes  a  $115  million  allocation 
from  the  State’s  General  Fund  to  address  the  drought,  and  addresses  deferred  maintenance 
issues with $500 million from the State’s General Fund. 

 
The  complete  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget  is  available  from  the  California 
Department of Finance website at www.dof.ca.gov. The District can take no responsibility for the 
continued accuracy of this internet address or for the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of 
information posted there, and such information is not incorporated in this Official Statement by 
such  reference.  The  information  referred  to  above  should  not  be  relied  upon  in  making  an 
investment decision with respect to the Series C Bonds. 

 
The execution of 2015-16 Proposed State Budget may be affected by numerous factors, 
including  but  not  limited  to:  (i)  shifts  of  costs  from  the  federal  government  to  the  State,  (ii) 
national, State and international economic conditions, (ii) litigation risk associated with proposed 
spending reductions, (iii) rising health care costs and (iv) other factors, all or any of which could 
cause the revenue and spending projections made in the 2015-16 Proposed State Budget to be 
unattainable. The District cannot predict the impact that the 2015-16 Proposed State Budget, or 
subsequent  budgets,  will  have  on  its  own  finances  and  operations.    Additionally,  the  District 
cannot predict the accuracy of any projections made in the 2015-16 Proposed State Budget. 

 
2015-16 May Revision.  On May 14, 2015 Governor Brown released the 2015-16 May 
Revision  (the  “May  Revision”).  Overall,  the  May  Revision  reflects  a  $6.7  billion  increase  in 

B-22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  Fund  revenues  compared  to  the  2015-16  Proposed  State  Budget.  Due  to  higher 
expected revenues, the May Revision reflects: 

• 

Increased  State  general  fund  spending  by  $5.5  billion  for  K-12  schools  and 
community colleges due to Proposition 98 requirements. 

•  An additional $633 million saved in the Rainy Day Fund and an additional $633 
million  used  to  pay  down  State  debts  and  liabilities  due  to  Proposition  2 
requirements 

•  Creation  of  a  California  Earned  Income  Tax  Credit  to  assist  the  states  lowest 

income workers. 

•  Holding  tuition  flat  at  the  State’s  universities  for  California  undergraduate 
students for two more years by providing increased ongoing funding to California 
State  Universities  and  temporary  assistance  to  the  Universities  of  California  to 
pay down unfunded pension liabilities. 

•  Providing  health  care  and  other  safety  net  services  to  currently  undocumented 
immigrants who gain Permanent Residence Under Color of Law status under the 
United States President’s executive actions. 

 
However, the Governor cautions that the 2015-16 Budget remains precariously balanced 
and  could  face  deficits  in  succeeding  years.  The  State  has  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  in 
existing  liabilities,  such  as  deferred  maintenance  on  roads  and  other  infrastructure,  and  an 
unfunded liability for future retiree health care benefits for state employees and various pension 
benefits. 
 
Uncertainty  Regarding  Future  State  Budgets.    The  District  cannot  predict  what 
actions will be taken in future years by the State Legislature and the Governor to address the 
State’s current or future budget deficits.  Future State budgets will be affected by national and 
state economic conditions and other factors over which the District has no control.  The District 
cannot predict what impact any future budget proposals will have on the financial condition of 
the  District.    To  the  extent  that  the  State  budget  process  results  in  reduced  revenues  to  the 
District, the District will be required to make adjustments to its budgets.  

 
The State has not entered into any contractual commitment with the District, the County, 
or the Owners of the Series C Bonds to provide State budget information to the District or the 
owners  of  the  Series  C  Bonds.    Although  they  believe  the  State  sources  of  information  listed 
above  are  reliable,  neither  the  District  nor  the  Underwriter  assumes  any  responsibility  for  the 
accuracy  of  the  State  Budget  information  set  forth  or  referred  to  in  this  Official  Statement  or 
incorporated herein. However, the Series C Bonds are secured by ad valorem taxes levied and 
collected  on  taxable  property  in  the  District,  without  limit  as  to  rate  or  amount,  and  are  not 
secured by a pledge of revenues of the District or its general fund.

Legal Challenges to State Funding of Education 

 
The application of Proposition 98 and other statutory regulations has been the subject of 
various legal challenges in recent years, and is likely to be further challenged in the future.  For 
a discussion of how the provisions of Proposition 98 have been applied to school funding see “- 
State Funding of Education" and "-Recent State Budgets” above. 

CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING 

DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS 

 
Principal of and interest on the Series C Bonds are payable from the proceeds of an ad 
valorem tax levied by the County for the payment thereof.  Articles XIIIA, XIIIB, XIIIC, and XIIID 
of the State Constitution, Propositions 62, 98, 111, 187 and 218, and certain other provisions of 
law  discussed  below,  are  included  in  this  section  to  describe  the  potential  effect  of  these 
Constitutional and statutory measures on the ability of the District to levy taxes and spend tax 
proceeds for operating and other purposes, and it should not be inferred from the inclusion of 
such materials that these laws impose any limitation on the ability of the District to levy taxes for 
payment  of  the  Series  C  Bonds.    The  tax  levied  by  the  County  for  payment  of  the  Series  C 
Bonds was approved by the District's voters in compliance with Article XIIIA and all applicable 
laws. 

Constitutionally Required Funding of Education 

 
The State Constitution requires that from all State revenues, there shall be first set apart 
the moneys to be applied by the State for the support of the public school system and public 
institutions  of  higher  education.    School  districts  receive  a  significant  portion  of  their  funding 
from  State  appropriations.    As  a  result,  decreases  and  increases  in  State  revenues  can 
significantly affect appropriations made by the State Legislature to school districts. 

 

 
 

 

 

 

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution 
 

Basic Property Tax Levy.  On June 6, 1978, California voters approved Proposition 13 
("Proposition 13"), which added Article XIIIA to the State Constitution ("Article XIIIA").  Article 
XIIIA  limits  the  amount  of  any  ad  valorem  tax  on  real  property  to  1%  of  the  full  cash  value 
thereof,  except  that  additional  ad  valorem  taxes  may  be  levied  to  pay  debt  service  on  (i) 
indebtedness approved by the voters prior to July 1, 1978, (ii) (as a result of an amendment to 
Article  XIIIA  approved  by  State  voters  on  June  3,  1986)  on  bonded  indebtedness  for  the 
acquisition or improvement of real property which has been approved on or after July 1, 1978 by 
two-thirds of the voters on such indebtedness (which provided the authority for the issuance of 
the Refunded Bonds), and (iii) (as a result of an amendment to Article XIIIA approved by State 
voters on November 7, 2000) bonded indebtedness incurred by a school district or community 
college  district  for  the  construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation  or  replacement  of  school 
facilities or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities, approved by 55% of the 
voters of the district, but only if certain accountability measures are included in the proposition. 
Article XIIIA defines full cash value to mean "the county assessor’s valuation of real property as 
shown on the 1975-76 tax bill under full cash value, or thereafter, the appraised value of real 
property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership have occurred after the 
1975 assessment".  This full cash value may be increased at a rate not to exceed 2% per year 
to account for inflation.  

B-24 

 

 

Article XIIIA has subsequently been amended to permit reduction of the "full cash value" 
base in the event of declining property values caused by damage, destruction or other factors, 
to  provide  that  there  would  be  no  increase  in  the  "full  cash  value"  base  in  the  event  of 
reconstruction of property damaged or destroyed in a disaster and in other minor or technical 
ways. 

 
Legislation Implementing Article XIIIA. Legislation has been enacted and amended a 
number of times since 1978 to implement Article XIIIA.  Under current law, local agencies are no 
longer permitted to levy directly any property tax (except to pay voter-approved indebtedness).  
The 1% property tax is automatically levied by the county and distributed according to a formula 
among  taxing  agencies.    The  formula  apportions  the  tax  roughly  in  proportion  to  the  relative 
shares of taxes levied prior to 1979. 

 
Increases  of  assessed  valuation  resulting  from  reappraisals  of  property  due  to  new 
construction,  change  in  ownership  or  from  the  annual  adjustment  not  to  exceed  2%  are 
allocated among the various jurisdictions in the “taxing area” based upon their respective “situs.”  
Any such allocation made to a local agency continues as part of its allocation in future years. 

 
Inflationary Adjustment of Assessed Valuation.  As described above, the assessed 
value  of  a  property  may  be  increased  at  a  rate  not  to  exceed  2%  per  year  to  account  for 
inflation.  On December 27, 2001, the Orange County Superior Court, in County of Orange v. 
Orange County Assessment Appeals Board No. 3, held that where a home’s taxable value did 
not increase for two years, due to a flat real estate market, the Orange County assessor violated 
the 2% inflation adjustment provision of Article XIIIA, when the assessor tried to "recapture" the 
tax  value  of  the  property  by  increasing  its  assessed  value  by  4%  in  a  single  year.    The 
assessors  in  most  California  counties,  including  the  County,  use  a  similar  methodology  in 
raising  the  taxable  values  of  property  beyond  2%  in  a  single  year.    The  State  Board  of 
Equalization  has  approved  this  methodology  for  increasing  assessed  values.    On  appeal,  the 
Appellate Court held that the trial court erred in ruling that assessments are always limited to no 
more than 2% of the previous year’s assessment.  On May 10, 2004 a petition for review was 
filed  with  the  California  Supreme  Court.    The  petition  has  been  denied  by  the  California 
Supreme  Court.    As  a  result  of  this  litigation,  the  “recapture”  provision  described  above  may 
continue to be employed in determining the full cash value of property for property tax purposes. 

Article XIIIB of the California Constitution 
 

Article XIIIB  (“Article XIIIB”)  of  the  State  Constitution,  as  subsequently  amended  by 
Propositions 98 and 111, respectively, limits the annual appropriations of the State and of any 
city,  county,  school  district,  authority  or  other  political  subdivision  of  the  State  to  the  level  of 
appropriations  of  the  particular  governmental  entity  for  the  prior  fiscal  year,  as  adjusted  for 
changes in the cost of living and in population and for transfers in the financial responsibility for 
providing services and for certain declared emergencies.  For fiscal years beginning on or after 
July 1, 1990, the appropriations limit of each entity of government shall be the appropriations 
limit for the 1986-87 fiscal year adjusted for the changes made from that fiscal year under the 
provisions of Article XIIIB, as amended. 

 
The  appropriations  of  an  entity  of  local  government  subject  to  Article XIIIB  limitations 
include  the  proceeds  of  taxes  levied  by  or  for  that  entity  and  the  proceeds  of  certain  state 
subventions to that entity.  “Proceeds of taxes” include, but are not limited to, all tax revenues 
and the proceeds to the entity from (a) regulatory licenses, user charges and user fees (but only 

B-25 

 

to  the  extent  that  these  proceeds  exceed  the  reasonable  costs  in  providing  the  regulation, 
product or service), and (b) the investment of tax revenues. 

 
Appropriations subject to limitation do not include (a) refunds of taxes, (b) appropriations 
for debt service, (c) appropriations required to comply with certain mandates of the courts or the 
federal  government,  (d) appropriations  of  certain  special  districts,  (e) appropriations  for  all 
qualified  capital  outlay  projects  as  defined  by  the  legislature,  (f) appropriations  derived  from 
certain  fuel  and  vehicle  taxes  and  (g) appropriations  derived  from  certain  taxes  on  tobacco 
products. 

 
Article XIIIB  includes  a  requirement  that  all  revenues  received  by  an  entity  of 
government other than the State in a fiscal year and in the fiscal year immediately following it in 
excess  of  the  amount  permitted  to  be  appropriated  during  that  fiscal  year  and  the  fiscal  year 
immediately following it shall be returned by a revision of tax rates or fee schedules within the 
next  two  subsequent  fiscal  years.    However,  in  the  event  that  a  school  district’s  revenues 
exceed its spending limit, the district may in any fiscal year increase its appropriations limit to 
equal its spending by borrowing appropriations limit from the State. 

 
Article XIIIB also includes a requirement that 50% of all revenues received by the State 
in a fiscal year and in the fiscal year immediately following it in excess of the amount permitted 
to  be  appropriated  during  that  fiscal  year  and  the  fiscal  year  immediately  following  it  shall  be 
transferred and allocated to the State School Fund under Section 8.5 of Article XVI of the State 
Constitution.   
 
Unitary Property 
 

Some amount of property tax revenue of the District is derived from utility property which 
is  considered  part  of  a  utility  system  with  components  located  in  many  taxing  jurisdictions 
(“unitary  property”).    Under  the  State  Constitution,  such  property  is  assessed  by  the  State 
Board of Equalization (“SBE”) as part of a “going concern” rather than as individual pieces of 
real or personal property.  State-assessed unitary and certain other property is allocated to the 
counties by SBE, taxed at special county-wide rates, and the tax revenues distributed to taxing 
jurisdictions  (including  the  District)  according  to  statutory  formulae  generally  based  on  the 
distribution of taxes in the prior year. 
 
Articles XIIIC and XIIID 
 

On November 5, 1996, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 218, 
popularly known as the “Right to Vote on Taxes Act.”  Proposition 218 added to the California 
Constitution  Articles  XIIIC  and  XIIID  (respectively, “Article XIIIC”  and “Article XIIID”),  which 
contain a number of provisions affecting the ability of local agencies, including school districts, 
to levy and collect both existing and future taxes, assessments, fees and charges. 

 
According  to  the  “Title  and  Summary”  of  Proposition  218  prepared  by  the  California 
Attorney General, Proposition 218 limits “the authority of local governments to impose taxes and 
property-related assessments, fees and charges.”  Among other things, Article XIIIC establishes 
that  every  tax  is  either  a  “general  tax”  (imposed  for  general  governmental  purposes)  or  a 
“special  tax”  (imposed  for  specific  purposes),  prohibits  special  purpose  government  agencies 
such  as  school  districts  from  levying  general  taxes,  and  prohibits  any  local  agency  from 
imposing, extending or increasing any special tax beyond its maximum authorized rate without a 
two-thirds  vote;  and  also  provides  that  the  initiative  power  will  not  be  limited  in  matters  of 

B-26 

 

reducing or repealing local taxes, assessments, fees and charges.  Article XIIIC further provides 
that  no  tax  may  be  assessed  on  property  other  than  ad  valorem  property  taxes  imposed  in 
accordance with Articles XIII and XIIIA of the California Constitution and special taxes approved 
by a two-thirds vote under Article XIIIA, Section 4.   

 
On November 2, 2010, Proposition 26 was approved by State voters, which amended 
Article XIIIC to expand the definition of “tax” to include “any levy, charge, or exaction of any kind 
imposed by a local government” except the following: (1) a charge imposed for a specific benefit 
conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and 
which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit or 
granting  the  privilege;  (2)  a  charge  imposed  for  a  specific  government  service  or  product 
provided  directly  to  the  payor  that  is  not  provided  to  those  not  charged,  and  which  does  not 
exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of providing the service or product; (3) a 
charge imposed for the reasonable regulatory costs to a local government for issuing licenses 
and permits, performing investigations, inspections , and audits, enforcing agricultural marketing 
orders, and the administrative enforcement and adjudication thereof; (4) a charge imposed for 
entrance  to  or  use  of  local  government  property,  or  the  purchase,  rental,  or  lease  of  local 
government  property;  (5)  a  fine,  penalty,  or  other  monetary  charge  imposed  by  the  judicial 
branch  of  government  or  a  local  government,  as  a  result  of  a  violation  of  law;  (6)  a  charge 
imposed  as  a  condition  of  property  development;  and  (7)  assessments  and  property-related 
fees imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article XIIID.  Proposition 26 provides that the 
local government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy, 
charge, or other exaction is not a tax, that the amount is no more than necessary to cover the 
reasonable  costs  of  the  governmental  activity,  and  that  the  manner  in  which  those  costs  are 
allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor’s burdens on, or benefits 
received from, the governmental activity. 

 
Article  XIIID  deals  with  assessments  and  property-related  fees  and  charges,  and 
explicitly provides that nothing in Article XIIIC or XIIID will be construed to affect existing laws 
relating to the imposition of fees or charges as a condition of property development. 

 
While the provisions of Proposition 218 may have an indirect effect on the District, such 
as by limiting or reducing the revenues otherwise available to other local governments whose 
boundaries  encompass  property  located  within  the  District  (thereby  causing  such  local 
governments  to  reduce  service  levels  and  possibly  adversely  affecting  the  value  of  property 
within  the  District),  the  District  does  not  believe  that  Proposition  218  will  directly  impact  the 
revenues available to pay debt service on the Series A Bonds. 

 

Proposition 98 
 

On November 8, 1988, California voters approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative 
constitutional  amendment  and  statute  called  the  “Classroom  Instructional  Improvement  and 
Accountability  Act”  (the  “Accountability  Act”).    Certain  provisions  of  the  Accountability  Act 
have,  however,  been  modified  by  Proposition  111,  discussed  below,  the  provisions  of  which 
became  effective  on  July  1,  1990.    The  Accountability  Act  changes  State  funding  of  public 
education below the university level and the operation of the State’s appropriations limit.  The 
Accountability  Act  guarantees  State  funding  for  K-12  school  districts  and  community  college 
districts  (hereinafter  referred  to  collectively  as  “K-14  school  districts”)  at  a  level  equal  to  the 
greater of (a) the same percentage of general fund revenues as the percentage appropriated to 
such  districts  in  1986-87,  and  (b)  the  amount  actually  appropriated  to  such  districts  from  the 
general fund in the previous fiscal year, adjusted for increases in enrollment and changes in the 

B-27 

 

 

cost of living.  The Accountability Act permits the Legislature to suspend this formula for a one-
year period. 

 
The  Accountability  Act  also  changes  how  tax  revenues  in  excess  of  the  State 
appropriations  limit  are  distributed.    Any  excess  State  tax  revenues  up  to  a  specified  amount 
would, instead of being returned to taxpayers, be transferred to K-14 school districts.  Any such 
transfer to K-14 school districts would be excluded from the appropriations limit for K-14 school 
districts and the K-14 school district appropriations limit for the next year would automatically be 
increased  by  the  amount  of  such  transfer.    These  additional  moneys  would  enter  the  base 
funding calculation for K 14 school districts for subsequent years, creating further pressure on 
other portions of the State budget, particularly if revenues decline in a year following an Article 
XIIIB surplus.  The maximum amount of excess tax revenues which could be transferred to K 14 
school  districts  is  4%  of  the  minimum  State  spending  for  education  mandated  by  the 
Accountability Act. 

Proposition 111 
 

On  June  5,  1990,  the  voters  approved  Proposition  111  (Senate  Constitutional 
Amendment  No.  1)  called  the  “Traffic  Congestion  Relief  and  Spending  Limit  Act  of  1990” 
(“Proposition 111”) which further modified Article XIIIB and Sections 8 and 8.5 of Article XVI of 
the State Constitution with respect to appropriations limitations and school funding priority and 
allocation. 

 
The most significant provisions of Proposition 111 are summarized as follows: 
 
Annual Adjustments to Spending Limit.  The annual adjustments to the Article XIIIB 
spending limit were liberalized to be more closely linked to the rate of economic growth.  Instead 
of being tied to the Consumer Price Index, the “change in the cost of living” is now measured by 
the change in California per capita personal income.  The definition of “change in population” 
specifies that a portion of the State’s spending limit is to be adjusted to reflect changes in school 
attendance. 

 
Treatment  of  Excess  Tax  Revenues.    “Excess”  tax  revenues  with  respect  to  Article 
XIIIB  are  now  determined  based  on  a  two-year  cycle,  so  that  the  State  can  avoid  having  to 
return to taxpayers excess tax revenues in one year if its appropriations in the next fiscal year 
are under its limit.  In addition, the Proposition 98 provision regarding excess tax revenues was 
modified.  After any two-year period, if there are excess State tax revenues, 50% of the excess 
are to be transferred to K-14 school districts with the balance returned to taxpayers; under prior 
law, 100% of excess State tax revenues went to K-14 school districts, but only up to a maximum 
of 4% of the schools’ minimum funding level.  Also, reversing prior law, any excess State tax 
revenues  transferred  to  K-14  school  districts  are  not  built  into  the  school  districts’  base 
expenditures  for  calculating  their  entitlement  for  State  aid  in  the  next  year,  and  the  State’s 
appropriations limit is not to be increased by this amount. 

 
Exclusions  from  Spending  Limit.    Two  exceptions  were  added  to  the  calculation  of 
appropriations which are subject to the Article XIIIB spending limit.  First, there are excluded all 
appropriations for “qualified capital outlay projects” as defined by the Legislature.  Second, there 
are excluded any increases in gasoline taxes above the 1990 level (then nine cents per gallon), 
sales and use taxes on such increment in gasoline taxes, and increases in receipts from vehicle 
weight  fees  above  the  levels  in  effect  on  January  1,  1990.    These  latter  provisions  were 
necessary  to  make  effective  the  transportation  funding  package  approved  by  the  Legislature 

B-28 

 

 

and the Governor, which expected to raise over $15 billion in additional taxes from 1990 through 
2000 to fund transportation programs. 

 
Recalculation of Appropriations Limit.  The Article XIIIB appropriations limit for each 
unit of government, including the State, is to be recalculated beginning in fiscal year 1990-91.  It 
is based on the actual limit for fiscal year 1986-87, adjusted forward to 1990-91 as if Proposition 
111 had been in effect. 

 
School Funding Guarantee.  There is a complex adjustment in the formula enacted in 
Proposition 98 which guarantees K-14 school districts a certain amount of State general fund 
revenues.  Under prior law, K-14 school districts were guaranteed the greater of (1) 40.9% of 
State general fund revenues (the “first test”) or (2) the amount appropriated in the prior year 
adjusted for changes in the cost of living (measured as in Article XIIIB by reference to per capita 
personal  income)  and  enrollment  (the  “second  test”).    Under  Proposition  111,  schools  will 
receive the greater of (1) the first test, (2) the second test, or (3) a third test, which will replace 
the  second  test  in  any  year  when  growth  in per  capita  State  general  fund  revenues  from  the 
prior  year  is  less  than  the  annual  growth  in  California  per  capita  personal  income  (the “third 
test”).    Under  the  third  test,  schools  will  receive  the  amount  appropriated  in  the  prior  year 
adjusted  for  change  in  enrollment  and  per  capita  State  general  fund  revenues,  plus  an 
additional small adjustment factor.  If the third test is used in any year, the difference between 
the third test and the second test will become a “credit” to schools which will be paid in future 
years when State general fund revenue growth exceeds personal income growth. 

Proposition 39 

 
On November 7, 2000, California voters approved an amendment (commonly known as 
“Proposition  39”)  to  the  California  Constitution.  This  amendment  (1)  allows  school  facilities 
bond measures to be approved by 55% (rather than two-thirds) of the voters in local elections 
and permits property taxes to exceed the current 1% limit in order to repay the bonds and (2) 
changes existing statutory law regarding charter school facilities.  As adopted, the constitutional 
amendments  may  be  changed  only  with  another  Statewide  vote  of  the  people.  The  statutory 
provisions could be changed by a majority vote of both houses of the Legislature and approval 
by  the  Governor,  but  only  to  further  the  purposes  of  the  proposition.    The  local  school 
jurisdictions  affected  by  this  proposition  are  K-12  school  districts,  community  college  districts, 
including  the  District,  and  county  offices  of  education.  As  noted  above,  the  California 
Constitution  previously  limited  property  taxes  to  1%  of  the  value  of  property.    Prior  to  the 
approval of Proposition 39, property taxes could only exceed this limit to pay for (1) any local 
government  debts  approved  by  the  voters  prior  to  July  1,  1978  or  (2)  bonds  to  acquire  or 
improve real property that receive two-thirds voter approval after July 1, 1978.   

 
The  55%  vote  requirement  authorized  by  Proposition  39  applies  only  if  the  local  bond 
measure presented to the voters includes: (1) a requirement that the bond funds can be used 
only for construction, rehabilitation, equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of 
real  property  for  school  facilities;  (2)  a  specific  list  of  school  projects  to  be  funded  and 
certification  that  the  school  board  has  evaluated  safety,  class  size  reduction,  and  information 
technology  needs  in  developing  the  list;  and  (3)  a  requirement  that  the  school  board  conduct 
annual, independent financial and performance audits until all bond funds have been spent to 
ensure  that  the  bond  funds  have  been  used  only  for  the  projects  listed  in  the  measure. 
Legislation  approved  in  June  2000  places  certain  limitations  on  local  school  bonds  to  be 
approved by 55% of the voters.  These provisions require that the tax rate levied as the result of 
any single election be no more than $60 (for a unified school district), $30 (for an elementary 

B-29 

school district or high school district), or $25 (for a community college district), per $100,000 of 
taxable property value.  These requirements are not part of this proposition and can be changed 
with a majority vote of both houses of the Legislature and approval by the Governor. 

Proposition 30 

 
Guaranteed  Local  Public  Safety  Funding,  Initiative  Constitutional  Amendment  (also 
known  as  “Proposition  30”),  which  temporarily  increases  the  State  Sales  and  Use  Tax  and 
personal income tax rates on higher incomes.  Proposition 30 temporarily imposes an additional 
tax on all retailers, at the rate of 0.25% of gross receipts from the sale of all tangible personal 
property  sold  in  the  State  from  January  1,  2013  to  December  31,  2016.    Proposition  30  also 
imposes  an  additional  excise  tax  on  the  storage,  use,  or  other  consumption  in  the  State  of 
tangible personal property purchased from a retailer on and after January 1, 2013 and before 
January  1,  2017.    This  excise  tax  will  be  levied  at  a  rate  of  0.25%  of  the  sales  price  of  the 
property  so  purchased.    For  personal  income  taxes  imposed  beginning  in  the  taxable  year 
commencing  January  1,  2012  and  ending  December  31,  2018,  Proposition  30  increases  the 
marginal  personal  income  tax  rate  by:  (i)  1%  for  taxable  income  over  $250,000  but  less  than 
$300,000  for  single  filers  (over  $340,000  but  less  than  $408,000  for  joint  filers),  (ii)  2%  for 
taxable income over $300,000 but less than $500,000 for single filers (over $408,000 but less 
than  $680,000  for  joint  filers),  and  (iii)  3%  for  taxable  income  over  $500,000  for  single  filers 
(over $680,000 for joint filers). 

 
The  revenues  generated  from  the  temporary  tax  increases  will  be  included  in  the 
calculation of the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee for school districts and community 
college  districts.  See  “Proposition  98”  and  “Proposition  111”  above.  From  an  accounting 
perspective, the revenues generated from the temporary tax increases will be deposited into the 
State account created pursuant to Proposition 30 called the Education Protection Account (the 
“EPA”). Pursuant to Proposition 30, funds in the EPA will be allocated quarterly, with 89% of 
such funds provided to schools districts and 11% provided to community college districts. The 
funds will be distributed to school districts and community college districts in the same manner 
as existing unrestricted per-student funding, except that no school district will receive less than 
$200 per unit of ADA and no community college district will receive less than $100 per full time 
equivalent student.  The governing board of each school district and community college district 
is  granted  sole  authority  to  determine  how  the  moneys  received  from  the  EPA  are  spent, 
provided 
these  spending 
determinations  in  open  session  at  a  public  meeting  and  such  local  governing  boards  are 
prohibited from using any funds from the EPA for salaries or benefits of administrators or any 
other administrative costs. 

the  appropriate  governing  board 

is  required 

to  make 

that, 

 

 

 

Proposition 1A and Proposition 22 
 

On November 2, 2004, California voters approved Proposition 1A, which amended the 
State  constitution  to  significantly  reduce  the  State's  authority  over  major  local  government 
revenue sources.  Under  Proposition 1A, the State cannot (i) reduce local sales tax rates or  
alter the method of allocating the revenue generated by such taxes,  (ii) shift property taxes from 
local governments to schools or community colleges, (iii) change how property tax revenues are 
shared  among  local  governments  without  two-thirds  approval  of  both  houses  of  the  State 
Legislature or (iv) decrease Vehicle License Fee revenues without providing local governments 
with equal replacement funding.  Under Proposition 1A, beginning, in fiscal year 2008-09, the 
State  may  shift  to  schools  and  community  colleges  a  limited  amount  of  local  government 
property tax revenue if certain conditions are met, including: (i) a proclamation by the  Governor 

B-30 

 

that the shift is needed due to a severe financial hardship  of the State, and (ii) approval of the 
shift  by  the  State  Legislature  with  a  two-thirds  vote  of  both  houses.    Under  such  a  shift,  the 
State  must  repay  local  governments  for  their  property  tax  losses,  with  interest,  within  three 
years.  Proposition 1A does allow the State to approve voluntary  exchanges of local sales tax 
and  property  tax  revenues  among  local  governments  within  a  county.    Proposition  1A  also 
amended  the  State  Constitution  to  require  the  State  to  suspend  certain  State  laws  creating 
mandates in any year that the State does not fully reimburse local governments for their costs to 
comply  with  the  mandates.    This  provision  does  not  apply  to  mandates  relating  to  schools  or 
community colleges or to those mandates relating to employee rights. 

 
Proposition 22, a constitutional initiative entitled the “Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and 
Transportation Protection Act of 2010,” approved on November 2, 2010, superseded many of 
the  provisions  of  Proposition  1A.    This  initiative  amends  the  State  constitution  to  prohibit  the 
legislature from diverting or shifting revenues that are dedicated to funding services provided by 
local  government  or  funds  dedicated  to  transportation  improvement  projects  and  services.  
Under  this  proposition,  the  State  is  not  allowed  to  take  revenue  derived  from  locally  imposed 
taxes,  such  as  hotel  taxes,  parcel  taxes,  utility  taxes  and  sales  taxes,  and  local public  transit 
and transportation funds.  Further, in the event that a local governmental agency sues the State 
alleging a violation of these provisions and wins, then the State must automatically appropriate 
the funds needed to pay that local government.  This Proposition was intended to, among other 
things, stabilize local government revenue sources by restricting the State’s control over local 
property taxes.  Proposition 22 did not prevent the California State Legislature from dissolving 
State  redevelopment  agencies  pursuant  to  AB  1X26,  as  confirmed  by  the  decision  of  the 
California  Supreme  Court  decision  in  California  Redevelopment  Association  v.  Matosantos 
(2011).  
 
Because  Proposition  22  reduces  the  State’s  authority  to  use  or  reallocate  certain 
revenue sources, fees and taxes for State general fund purposes, the State will have to take 
other actions to balance its budget, such as reducing State spending or increasing State taxes, 
and school and college districts that receive Proposition 98 or other funding from the State will 
be more directly dependent upon the State’s general fund. 

 

Future Initiatives 
 

Article XIIIA, Article XIIIB, Article XIIIC and Article XIIID of the California Constitution and 
Propositions 98, 111, 1A, 22, 26, 30 and 39 were each adopted as measures that qualified for 
the ballot under the State’s initiative process.  From time to time other initiative measures could 
be adopted further affecting District revenues or the District’s ability to expend revenues.  The 
nature and impact of these measures cannot be anticipated by the District.

Effective Buying income 

 
"Effective Buying Income" is defined as personal income less personal tax and nontax 
payments, a number often referred to as "disposable" or "after-tax" income.  Personal income is 
the  aggregate  of  wages  and  salaries,  other  labor-related  income  (such  as  employer 
contributions  to  private  pension  funds),  proprietor’s  income,  rental  income  (which  includes 
imputed  rental  income  of  owner-occupants  of  non-farm  dwellings),  dividends  paid  by 
corporations,  interest  income  from  all  sources,  and  transfer  payments  (such  as  pensions  and 
welfare  assistance).    Deducted  from  this  total  are  personal  taxes  (federal,  state  and  local), 
nontax  payments  (fines,  fees,  penalties,  etc.)  and  personal  contributions  to  social  insurance.  
According  to  U.S.  government  definitions,  the  resultant  figure  is  commonly  known  as 
"disposable personal income."  

 
The  following  table  summarizes  the  total  effective  buying  income  for  the  County,  the

Government  Code  (the  “Act”),  and  a  resolution  of  the  Board  adopted  on  April  22,  2015  (the 
“Resolution”).  We have examined the law and such certified proceedings and other papers as 
we deemed necessary to render this opinion.  

 
As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon representations of 
the Board contained in the Resolution and in the certified proceedings and other certifications 
furnished to us, without undertaking to verify such facts by independent investigation.  

 
Based upon our examination, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:  
 
1. 

The District is a duly created and validly existing unified school district with the 

power to issue the Bonds, and to perform its obligations under the Resolution and the Bonds.  

The Resolution has been duly adopted by the Board, and constitutes a valid and 

binding obligation of the District enforceable upon the District.  

The  Bonds  have  been  duly  authorized,  executed  and  delivered  by  the  District, 

and are valid and binding general obligations of the District.  

D-1 

4. 

The Board of Supervisors of Mendocino County is required under the Act to levy 
an  ad  valorem  tax  upon  the  property  in  the  District,  unlimited  as  to  rate  or  amount,  for  the 
payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds. 

The interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax 
purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum 
tax imposed on individuals and corporations; it should be noted, however, that for the purpose 
of  computing  the  alternative  minimum  tax  imposed  on  corporations  (as  defined  for  federal 
income  tax  purposes),  such  interest  is  taken  into  account  in  determining  certain  income  and 
earnings.  The  Bonds  are  “qualified  tax-exempt  obligations”  within  the  meaning  of  section 
265(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), such that in the case of certain 
financial  institutions  (within  the  meaning  of  section  265(b)(5)  of  the  Code),  a  deduction  is 
allowed  for  80%  of  that  portion  of  such  financial  institutions'  interest  expense  allocable  to 
interest payable on the Bonds.  The opinions set forth in the preceding sentences are subject to 
the condition that the District comply with all requirements of the Code that must be satisfied 
subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest thereon be, or continue to be, 
excluded from gross income for federal tax purposes.  The District has covenanted to comply 
with each such requirement.  Failure to comply with certain of such requirements may cause the 
inclusion  of  interest  on  the  Bonds  in  gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  to  be 
retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds.  We express no opinion regarding other federal 
tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds.  

 

 
5. 

 
6. 

 
 

 

The interest on the Bonds is exempt from personal income taxation imposed by 

the State of California.  

 
The  rights  of  the  owners  of  the  Bonds  and  the  enforceability  of  the  Bonds  and  the 
Resolution  may  be  subject  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  and  other 
similar laws affecting creditors' rights heretofore or hereafter enacted and may also be subject 
to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases.  

Respectfully submitted,

governmental authority has assumed jurisdiction over substantially all of the assets or business 
of the District, or if such jurisdiction has been assumed by leaving the existing governing body 
and  officials  or  officers  in  possession  but  subject  to  the  supervision  and  orders  of  a  court  or 
governmental  authority,  or  the  entry  of  an  order  confirming  a  plan  of  reorganization, 
arrangement,  or  liquidation  by  a  court  or  governmental  authority  having  supervision  or 
jurisdiction over substantially all of the assets or business of the District. 

 
Section  6.    Identifying  Information  for  Filings  with  the  MSRB.    All  documents 
provided  to  the  MSRB  under  the  Disclosure  Certificate  shall  be  accompanied  by  identifying 
information as prescribed by the MSRB.  

 
Section 7.  Termination of Reporting Obligation.  The District’s obligations under this 
Disclosure Certificate shall terminate upon the legal defeasance, prior redemption or payment in 
full of all of the Bonds.  If such termination occurs prior to the final maturity of the Bonds, the 
District  shall  give  notice  of  such  termination  in  the  same  manner  as  for  a  Listed  Event  under 
Section 5(c). 

 
Section  8.    Dissemination  Agent.    The  District  may,  from  time  to  time,  appoint  or 
engage a Dissemination Agent to assist it in carrying out its obligations under this Disclosure 
Certificate, and may discharge any Dissemination Agent, with or without appointing a successor 
Dissemination Agent.  The initial Dissemination Agent shall be the District.  Any Dissemination 
Agent may resign by providing 30 days’ written notice to the District and the Paying Agent. 

 
Section  9.    Amendment;  Waiver.    Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this 
Disclosure Certificate, the District may amend this Disclosure Certificate, and any provision of 
this Disclosure Certificate may be waived, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: 

 

 

 
(c) 

 
(d)  

(a) 

if  the  amendment  or  waiver  relates  to  the  provisions  of  Sections 
3(a), 4 or 5(a), it may only be made in connection with a change in circumstances 
that arises from a change in legal requirements, change in law, or change in the 
identity,  nature,  or  status  of  an  obligated  person  with  respect  to  the  Bonds,  or 
type of business conducted; 

the  undertakings  herein,  as  proposed  to  be  amended  or  waived, 
would, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with 

 
(b) 

E-5 

the  requirements  of  the  Rule  at  the  time  of  the  primary  offering  of  the  Bonds, 
after taking into account any amendments or interpretations of the Rule, as well 
as any change in circumstances; and 

 
(c)  

 

 

the  proposed  amendment  or  waiver  either  (i)  is  approved  by 
holders of the Bonds in the manner provided in the Resolution for amendments 
to the Resolution with the consent of holders, or (ii) does not, in the opinion of 
nationally recognized bond counsel, materially impair the interests of the holders 
or beneficial owners of the Bonds. 
 
If the annual financial information or operating data to be provided in the Annual Report 
is  amended  pursuant  to  the  provisions  hereof,  the  first  annual  financial  information  filed 
pursuant hereto containing the amended operating data or financial information shall explain, in 
narrative  form,  the  reasons  for  the  amendment  and  the  impact  of  the  change  in  the  type  of 
operating data or financial information being provided.  

 
If an amendment is made to the undertaking specifying the accounting principles to be 
followed in preparing financial statements, the annual financial information for the year in which 
the change is made shall present a comparison between the financial statements or information 
prepared on the basis of the new accounting principles and those prepared on the basis of the 
former  accounting  principles.    The  comparison  shall  include  a  qualitative  discussion  of  the 
differences  in  the  accounting  principles  and  the  impact  of  the  change  in  the  accounting 
principles  on  the  presentation  of  the  financial  information,  in  order  to  provide  information  to 
investors  to  enable  them  to  evaluate  the  ability  of  the  District  to  meet  its  obligations.    To  the 
extent reasonably feasible, the comparison shall be quantitative.  A notice of the change in the 
accounting principles shall be filed in the same manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5(c). 

 
Section  10.    Additional  Information.    Nothing  in  this  Disclosure  Certificate  shall  be 
deemed  to  prevent  the  District  from  disseminating  any  other  information,  using  the  means  of 
dissemination set forth in this Disclosure Certificate or any other means of communication, or 
including any other information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event, 
in  addition  to  that  which  is  required  by  this  Disclosure  Certificate.    If  the  District  chooses  to 
include  any  information  in  any  Annual  Report  or  notice  of  occurrence  of  a  Listed  Event  in 
addition to that which is specifically required by this Disclosure Certificate, the District shall have 
no  obligation  under  this  Disclosure  Certificate  to  update  such  information  or  include  it  in  any 
future Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event. 

 
Section 11.  Default.  If the District fails to comply with any provision of this Disclosure 
Certificate,  the  Participating  Underwriter  or  any  holder  or  beneficial  owner  of  the  Bonds  may 
take such actions as may be necessary and appropriate, including seeking mandate or specific 
performance  by  court  order,  to  cause  the  District  to  comply  with  its  obligations  under  this 
Disclosure Certificate.  A default under this Disclosure Certificate shall not be deemed an Event 
of  Default  under  the  Resolution,  and  the  sole  remedy  under  this  Disclosure  Certificate  in  the 
event of any failure of the District to comply with this Disclosure Certificate shall be an action to 
compel performance.

Section 12.  Duties, Immunities and Liabilities of Dissemination Agent.   
 
(a) 

The Dissemination Agent shall have only such duties as are specifically set forth 
in this Disclosure Certificate, and the District agrees to indemnify and save the Dissemination 
Agent,  its  officers,  directors,  employees  and  agents,  harmless  against  any  loss,  expense  and 
liabilities which they may incur arising out of or in the exercise or performance of its powers and 
duties  hereunder,  including  the  costs  and  expenses  (including  attorneys  fees)  of  defending 
against  any  claim  of  liability,  but  excluding  liabilities  due  to  the  Dissemination  Agent’s 
negligence  or  willful  misconduct.    The  Dissemination  Agent  will  have  no  duty  or  obligation  to 
review any information provided to it by the District hereunder, and shall not be deemed to be 
acting  in  any  fiduciary  capacity  for  the  District,  the  Bondholders  or  any  other  party.    The 
obligations  of  the  District  under  this  Section  shall  survive  resignation  or  removal  of  the 
Dissemination Agent and payment of the Bonds. 

 
(b) The Dissemination Agent shall be paid compensation by the District for its services 
provided hereunder in accordance with its schedule of fees as amended from time to time, and 
shall  be  reimbursed  for  all  expenses,  legal  fees  and  advances  made  or  incurred  by  the 
Dissemination Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder. 

 
Section 13. Beneficiaries.  This Disclosure Certificate shall inure solely to the benefit of 
the District, the Dissemination Agent, the Participating Underwriter and holders and beneficial 
owners from time to time of the Bonds, and shall create no rights in any other person or entity.

DTC AND THE BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM 

 

The following description of the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), the procedures and 
record keeping with respect to beneficial ownership interests in the Bonds, payment of principal, 
interest and other payments on the Series C Bonds to DTC Participants or Beneficial Owners, 
confirmation  and  transfer  of  beneficial  ownership  interest  in  the  Series  C  Bonds  and  other 
related transactions by and between DTC, the DTC Participants and the Beneficial Owners is 
based  solely  on  information  provided  by  DTC.    Accordingly,  no  representations  can  be  made 
concerning  these  matters  and  neither  the  DTC  Participants  nor  the  Beneficial  Owners  should 
rely on the foregoing information with respect to such matters, but should instead confirm the 
same with DTC or the DTC Participants, as the case may be.   

 
Neither  the  District  nor  the  Paying  Agent  take  any  responsibility  for  the  information 

contained in this Section.  

 
No  assurances  can  be  given  that  DTC,  DTC  Participants  or  Indirect  Participants  will 
distribute to the Beneficial Owners (a) payments of interest, principal or premium, if any, with 
respect  to  the  Series  C  Bonds,  (b) Bonds  representing  ownership  interest  in  or  other 
confirmation or ownership interest in the Series C Bonds, or (c) redemption or other notices sent 
to DTC or Cede & Co., its nominee, as the registered owner of the Series C Bonds, or that they 
will so do on a timely basis, or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act 
in the manner described in this Appendix.  The current "Rules" applicable to DTC are on file with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the current "Procedures" of DTC to be followed 
in dealing with DTC Participants are on file with DTC. 

 
1.    The  Depository  Trust  Company  (“DTC”),  New  York,  NY,  will  act  as  securities 
depository for the securities (in this Appendix, the “Bonds”).  The Bonds will be issued as fully-
registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such 
other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered 
Bond will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds, in the aggregate principal amount of such 
maturity,  and  will  be  deposited  with  DTC.  If,  however,  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  any 
maturity exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of 
principal  amount  and  an  additional  certificate  will  be  issued  with  respect  to  any  remaining 
principal amount of such issue. 

 
2.    DTC,  the  world’s  largest  securities  depository,  is  a  limited-purpose  trust  company 
organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the 
New  York  Banking  Law,  a  member  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System,  a  “clearing  corporation” 
within  the  meaning  of  the  New  York  Uniform  Commercial  Code,  and  a  “clearing  agency” 
registered  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Section  17A  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934. 
DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity 
issues,  corporate  and  municipal  debt  issues,  and  money  market  instruments  (from  over  100 
countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC.  DTC also facilitates 
the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in 
deposited  securities,  through  electronic  computerized  book-entry  transfers  and  pledges 
between  Direct  Participants’  accounts.    This  eliminates  the  need  for  physical  movement  of 
securities certificates.  Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and 
dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations.  DTC is 

H-1 
F-1

 

a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is 
the  holding  company  for  DTC,  National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  and  Fixed  Income 
Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users 
of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both 
U.S.  and  non-U.S.  securities  brokers  and  dealers,  banks,  trust  companies,  and  clearing 
corporations  that  clear  through  or  maintain  a  custodial  relationship  with  a  Direct  Participant, 
either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+.  
The  DTC  Rules  applicable  to  its  Participants  are  on  file  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission.  More  information  about  DTC  can  be  found  at  www.dtcc.com.  The  information 
contained on this Internet site is not incorporated herein by reference. 

 
3.    Purchases  of  Bonds  under  the  DTC  system  must  be  made  by  or  through  Direct 
Participants, which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest 
of  each  actual  purchaser  of  each  Bond  (“Beneficial  Owner”)  is  in  turn  to  be  recorded  on  the 
Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation 
from  DTC  of  their  purchase.  Beneficial  Owners  are,  however,  expected  to  receive  written 
confirmations  providing  details  of  the  transaction,  as  well  as  periodic  statements  of  their 
holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into 
the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries 
made  on  the  books  of  Direct  and  Indirect  Participants  acting  on  behalf  of  Beneficial  Owners. 
Beneficial  Owners  will  not  receive  Bonds  representing  their  ownership  interests  in  Bonds, 
except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued. 

 
4.    To  facilitate  subsequent  transfers,  all  Bonds  deposited  by  Direct  Participants  with 
DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name 
as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DTC 
and  their  registration  in  the  name  of  Cede  &  Co.  or  such  other  nominee  do  not  effect  any 
change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the 
Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such 
Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect 
Participants  will  remain  responsible  for  keeping  account  of  their  holdings  on  behalf  of  their 
customers. 

 
5.  Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by 
Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to 
Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or 
regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may 
wish to take certain steps to augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with 
respect to the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the 
Bond  documents.  For  example,  Beneficial  Owners  of  Bonds  may  wish  to  ascertain  that  the 
nominee  holding  the  Bonds  for  their  benefit  has  agreed  to  obtain  and  transmit  notices  to 
Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and 
addresses to the registrar and request that copies of the notices be provided directly to them. 

 
6.  Redemption notices will be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within an issue 
are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each 
Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed. 

 
7.  Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with 
respect to the Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI 
Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to District as soon as 

H-2 
F-2

 

possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting 
rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Bonds are credited on the record date 
(identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). 

 
8.    Redemption  proceeds,  distributions,  and  interest  payments  on  the  Bonds  will  be 
made  to  Cede  &  Co.,  or  such  other  nominee  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized 
representative  of  DTC.  DTC’s  practice  is  to  credit  Direct  Participants’  accounts,  upon  DTC’s 
receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from District or Paying Agent on payable 
date  in  accordance  with  their  respective  holdings  shown  on  DTC’s  records.  Payments  by 
Participants  to  Beneficial  Owners  will  be  governed  by  standing  instructions  and  customary 
practices,  as  is  the  case  with  securities  held  for  the  accounts  of  customers  in  bearer  form  or 
registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC nor 
its  nominee,  Paying  Agent,  or  District,  subject  to  any  statutory  or  regulatory  requirements  as 
may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend 
payments  to  Cede  &  Co.  (or  such  other  nominee  as  may  be  requested  by  an  authorized 
representative  of  DTC)  is  the  responsibility  of  District  or  Paying  Agent,  disbursement  of  such 
payments  to  Direct  Participants  will  be  the  responsibility  of  DTC,  and  disbursement  of  such 
payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. 

 
9.  DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to 
the  Bonds  at  any  time  by  giving  reasonable  notice  to  District  or  Paying  Agent.  Under  such 
circumstances, in the event that a successor securities depository is not obtained, Bonds are 
required to be printed and delivered. 

 
10.    The  District  may  decide  to  discontinue  use  of  the  system  of  book-entry-only 
transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates will 
be printed and delivered to DTC. 

 
11.  The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has 
been  obtained  from  sources  that  District  believes  to  be  reliable,  but  District  takes  no 
responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

   STATEMENT OF 

INVESTMENT POLICY 

 
 

 

OFFICE OF 

SHARI L. SCHAPMIRE 

MENDOCINO COUNTY TREASURER 

JANUARY 2015 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
As  designated  by  the  Board  of  Supervisors  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  California,  it  is  the 
responsibility of the County Treasurer to secure  and protect the public  funds of the County,  as 
well as establish proper safeguards, controls, and procedures to maintain these funds in a lawful, 
rational,  and  auspicious  manner.    Said  maintenance  shall  include  the  prudent  and  secure 
investment  of  those  funds  that  are  not  immediately  required  for  daily  operations  in  a  manner 
anticipated  to  provide  additional  benefits  to  the  citizens  of  the  County  of  Mendocino.    In 
addition,  the  County  Treasurer  acts  as  the  Treasurer,  cash  manager,  and  investor  for  a  sizable 
number of public agencies within the County, rather than each entity having to locate and hire a 
knowledgeable  person  to  handle  the  entity’s  banking,  investments,  and  other  financial  duties 
separately.    This  pooling  of  public  funds  not  only  eliminates  duplication  of  expenses,  but  also 
levels out cash flow differences, permits cost savings through higher volume, and attracts more 
professional  service  providers.    This  document  contains  the  policies,  procedures,  and  legalities 
guiding the County Treasurer when investing funds.   
 
The  Investment  Policy  and  practices  of  the  County  Treasurer  are  based  on  prudent  money 
management  principles  and  California  State  Law,  specifically  Government  Code  Sections 
27000.1 - 27000.5, 27136, and 53600 - 53686.  The practices of this office will always comply 
with  the  legal  authority  and  limitations  placed  on  it  by  the  governing  legislative  bodies.  The 
implementation of these laws will be the focus of this policy statement. Where this Investment 
Policy specifies a percentage limitation, compliance will be measured as of the date of purchase.  
This document is reviewed no less than annually and may be adjusted as needed to reflect any 
changes in the Government Code or investment practices.   

  

II.  SCOPE 
 
This Investment Policy applies to all the County’s financial assets and investment activities with 
the following exceptions: 
 

 

A.  Proceeds  of  debt  issuance  shall  be  invested  in  accordance  with  the  County’s  general 
investment philosophy as set forth in this policy; however, such proceeds are invested in 
accordance with permitted investment provisions of their specific bond indentures. 
 

Pooling  of  Funds:  Except  for  cash  in  certain  restricted  and  special  funds,  the  County  will 
consolidate  cash  and  reserve  balances  from  all  funds  to  maximize  investment  earnings  and  to 
increase  efficiencies  with  regard  to  investment  pricing,  safekeeping,  and  administration. 
Investment  income  shall  be  allocated  quarterly,  on  the  average  daily  balance  method,  to  the 
various funds based on their respective participation and in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting  principles.    All  costs  related  to  investing,  maintaining,  and  accounting  for  the 
investments  purchased  for  the  Treasury  Pool,  as  authorized  by  California  Government  Code 
Section 27013, shall be apportioned equally on the same basis. 
 
III.   GENERAL OBJECTIVES 

 

 

2

 

The overriding objectives of the investment program are to preserve principal, provide sufficient 
liquidity,  and  manage  investment  risks.    The  specific  objectives  for  the  program  are  ranked  in 
order of importance: 

1.  Safety:  Safety  of  principal  is  the  foremost  objective  of  the  investment  program.  
Investments will be undertaken in a manner that seeks to  ensure the preservation of 
capital  in  the  overall  portfolio.    The  objective  will  be  to  mitigate  credit  risk  and 
interest rate risk.  

 

 

2.  Liquidity:  The  investment  portfolio  will  remain  sufficiently  liquid  to  meet  all 

operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated.  

3.  Return on Investments: The investment portfolio will be designed with the objective 
of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking 
into  account  the  investment  risk  constraints  for  safety  and  liquidity  needs.    Yield  is 
definitely considered to be of much less importance than safety and liquidity and shall 
not be a driving force in determining which investments are selected for purchase. 

 
IV.   PRUDENCE, INDEMNIFICATION, AND ETHICS 
 

A.  Prudent  Investor  Standard:    Management  of    the  County’s  investments  is  governed  by 
the  Prudent  Investor  Standard  as  set  forth  in  California  Government  Code  Section 
53600.3:   
 

“…all  governing  bodies  of  local  agencies  or  persons  authorized  to  make 
investment  decisions  on  behalf  of  those  local  agencies  investing  public  funds 
pursuant  to  this  chapter  are  trustees  and  therefore  fiduciaries  subject  to  the 
prudent  investor  standard.    When  investing,  reinvesting,  purchasing,  acquiring, 
exchanging, selling, or managing public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, 
prudence,  and  diligence  under  the  circumstances  then  prevailing,  including,  but 
not  limited  to,  the  general  economic  conditions  and  the  anticipated  needs  of  the 
County, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiarity with those 
matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like character and with like aims, 
to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of the County.  Within 
the limitations of this section and considering individual investments as part of an 
overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law.”   
 

B.  Indemnification:    The  Treasurer  and  other  authorized  persons  responsible  for  managing 
County  funds,  acting  in  accordance  with  the  investment  policy  and  exercising  due 
diligence,  will  be  relieved  of  personal  responsibility  for  an  individual  security’s  credit 
risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported within 
30 days and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. 

 
C.  Ethics:  Officers  and  employees  involved  in  the  investment  process  will  refrain  from 
personal  business  activity  that  could  conflict  with  proper  execution  of  the  investment 
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions.

V.  DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY 
 

A.  Authority  to  manage  the  County’s  investment  program  is  derived  from  California 
Government  Code  Sections  53600  et  seq.    The  governing  body  is  responsible  for  the 
County’s  cash  management,  including  the  administration  of  this  Investment  Policy. 
Management responsibility for the cash management of County funds is hereby delegated 
to the Treasurer.  

 

The  Treasurer  will  be  responsible  for  all  transactions  undertaken  and  will  establish  a 
system of procedures and controls to regulate the activities of subordinate employees. 
 

B.  The  County  may  engage  the  services  of  one  or  more  external  investment  managers  to 
assist  in  the  management  of  the  County’s  investment  portfolio  in  a  manner  consistent 
with  the  County’s  objectives.    Such  external  managers  may  be  granted  discretion  to 
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Investment Policy.  Such 
managers must be registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 

 
VI.   AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, DEPOSITORIES, AND BROKER/DEALERS 
 
A  list  will  be  maintained  of  financial  institutions  and  depositories  authorized  to  provide 
investment  services.  In  addition,  a  list  will  be  maintained  of  approved  security  broker/dealers 
selected  by  conducting  a  process  of  due  diligence.  These  may  include  "primary"  dealers  or 
regional  dealers  that  qualify  under  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  Rule  15C3-1 
(uniform net capital rule). 

 
A.  The  County  Treasurer  will  determine  which  financial  institutions  are  authorized  to 
provide  investment  services  to  the  County.    Institutions  eligible  to  transact  investment 
business with the County include: 

 

 

 

 

 

1.  Primary government dealers as designated by the Federal Reserve Bank; 
 
2.  Non-primary government dealers; 
 
3.  Nationally or state-chartered banks; 

4.  The Federal Reserve Bank; and, 

5.  Direct issuers of securities eligible for purchase.   

B.  Selection of financial institutions and broker/dealers authorized to engage in transactions 

with the County will be at the sole discretion of the County. 

 
C.  All  financial  institutions  which  desire  to  become  qualified  bidders  for  investment 
transactions (and which are not dealing only with the investment adviser) must supply the 
Treasurer  with  a  statement  certifying  that  the  institution  has  reviewed  the  California 
Government Code Section 53600 et seq. and the County’s Investment Policy. 

4

 

 

 

D.  Selection of broker/dealers used by an external investment adviser retained by the County 

will be at the sole discretion of the investment adviser.  

E.  Public deposits will be made only in qualified public depositories as established by State 
law.    Deposits  will  be  insured  by  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation,  or,  to  the 
extent  the  amount  exceeds  the  insured  maximum,  will  be  collateralized  in  accordance 
with State law. 

 
VII.  DELIVERY, SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY, AND COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS 
 

A.  Delivery-versus-payment:  Settlement  of  all  investment  transactions  will  be  completed 

using standard delivery-vs.-payment procedures. 

 

B.  Third-party  safekeeping:  To  protect  against  potential  losses  by  collapse  of  individual 
securities  dealers,  and  to  enhance  access  to  securities,  interest  payments  and  maturity 
proceeds, all securities owned by the County will be held in safekeeping by a third party 
bank  custodian,  acting  as  agent  for  the  County  under  the  terms  of  a  custody  agreement 
executed by the bank and the County. 
 

C.  Competitive transactions: All investment transactions will be conducted on a competitive 
basis which can be executed through a bidding process involving at least three separate 
brokers/financial  institutions  to  the  extent  possible  or  through  the  use  of  a  nationally 
recognized trading platform. 

 
VIII.  AUTHORIZED AND SUITABLE INVESTMENTS 
 
All investments will be made in accordance with Sections 53600 et seq. of the Government Code 
of the State of California and as described within this Investment Policy.  Permitted investments 
under this policy will include:

1.  State  law  notwithstanding,  any  investments  not  specifically  described  herein  are 

prohibited, including, but not limited to futures and options. 

 
2.  In  accordance  with  California  Government  Code  Section  53601.6,  investment  in 

inverse floaters, range notes, or mortgage derived interest-only strips is prohibited. 

3.  Purchasing securities with a final maturity longer than five years, unless approved by 

the Board of Supervisors, is prohibited. 

4.  Investment  in  any  security  that  could  result  in  a  zero  interest  accrual  if  held  to 

maturity is prohibited. 

5.  Trading  securities  for  the  sole  purpose  of  speculating  on  the  future  direction  of 

interest rates is prohibited.   

6.  Purchasing or selling securities on margin is prohibited. 

7.  The  use  of  reverse  repurchase  agreements,  securities  lending  or  any  other  form  of 

borrowing or leverage is prohibited. 

8.  The purchase of foreign currency denominated securities is prohibited. 

B.  Mitigating credit risk in the portfolio: Credit risk is the risk that a security or a portfolio 
will  lose  some  or  all  of  its  value  due  to  a  real  or  perceived  change  in  the  ability  of  the 
issuer to repay its debt.  The County will mitigate credit risk by  adopting the following 
strategies: 
 
1.  The  diversification  requirements  included  in  Section  VIII  are  designed  to  mitigate 

credit risk in the portfolio; 

 
2.  No more than five percent of the total portfolio may be invested in securities of any 

single issuer, other than the US Government, its agencies and enterprises; 

3.  The County may elect to sell a security prior to its maturity and record a capital gain 
or loss in order to improve the quality, liquidity, or yield of the portfolio in response 
to market conditions or County’s risk preferences; and, 

4.  If securities owned by the County are downgraded by either Moody’s or Standard & 
Poor’s  Rating  Agencies  to  a  level  below  the  quality  required  by  this  Investment 
Policy,  it  will  be  the  County’s  policy  to  review  the  credit  situation  and  make  a 
determination as to whether to sell or retain such securities in the portfolio.   

a.  If  a  security  is  downgraded,  the  Treasurer  will  use  discretion  in  determining 
whether  to  sell  or  hold  the  security  based  on  its  current  maturity,  the  economic 
outlook for the issuer, and other relevant factors. 

   

10

 

 

 

 

b.  If a decision is made to retain a downgraded security in the portfolio, its presence 

in the portfolio will be monitored and reported quarterly to the governing board. 

C.  Mitigating market risk in the portfolio:  Market risk is the risk that the portfolio value will 
fluctuate  due  to  changes  in  the  general  level  of  interest  rates.    The  County  recognizes 
that,  over  time,  longer-term  portfolios  have  the  potential  to  achieve  higher  returns.    On 
the other hand, longer-term portfolios have higher volatility of return.  The County will 
mitigate  market  risk  by  providing  adequate  liquidity  for  short-term  cash  needs,  and  by 
making longer-term investments only with funds that are not needed for current cash flow 
purposes.    The  County  further  recognizes  that  certain  types  of  securities,  including 
variable  rate  securities,  securities  with  principal  paydowns  prior  to  maturity,  and 
securities  with  embedded  options,  will  affect  the  market  risk  profile  of  the  portfolio 
differently  in  different  interest  rate  environments.    The  County,  therefore,  adopts  the 
following strategies to control and mitigate its exposure to market risk: 
 
1.  The  County  will  maintain  a  minimum  of  three  months  of  budgeted  operating 
expenditures  in  short  term  investments  to  provide  sufficient  liquidity  for  expected 
disbursements; 

 
2.  The  maximum  percent  of  callable  securities  (does  not  include  “make  whole  call” 

securities as defined in the Glossary) in the portfolio will be 20%; 

3.  The  maximum  stated  final  maturity  of  individual  securities  in  the  portfolio  will  be 

five years, except as otherwise stated in this policy; and, 

4.  The duration of the portfolio will at all times be approximately equal to the duration 
(typically plus or minus 20%) of a Market Benchmark Index selected by the County 
based on the County’s investment objectives, constraints, and risk tolerances.  

 
X.      INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES (PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND EVALUATION) 

 
A.  Overall objective:  The investment portfolio will be designed with the overall objective 
of  obtaining  a  total  rate  of  return  throughout  economic  cycles,  commensurate  with 
investment risk constraints and cash flow needs. 

 
B.  Specific  objective:    The  investment  performance  objective  for  the  portfolio  will  be  to 
earn a total rate of return over a market cycle which is approximately equal to the return 
on the selected Market Benchmark Index. 

 
XI.       SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS 
 
In the event all general  objectives mandated by  state law and set forth in Section  III  above are 
met  and  created  equal,  investments  in  corporate  securities  and  depository  institutions  will  be 
evaluated  for  social  and  environmental  concerns.    Investments  are  encouraged  in  entities  that 
support equality of rights regardless of sex, race, age, disability, or sexual orientation, as well as 
those  entities  that  practice  environmentally  sound  and  fair  labor  practices.  Investments  are 

 

11

 

discouraged in entities that receive a significant portion of their revenues from the manufacturer 
of tobacco products, firearms, or weapons not used in our national defense.    
 
XII.  PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS  

 
A.  Procedures:  The  Treasurer  will  establish  written  investment  policy  procedures  in  a 
separate  investment  procedures  manual  to  assist  investment  staff  with  day-to-day 
operations  of  the  investment  program  consistent  with  this  policy.  Such  procedures  will 
include  explicit  delegation  of  authority 
investment 
transactions.  No  person  may  engage  in  an  investment  transaction  except  as  provided 
under the terms of this policy as designated in Appendix I and the procedures established 
by the Treasurer. 

to  persons  responsible  for 

 
B.  Internal  Controls:  The  Treasurer  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  an 
internal  control  structure  designed  to  ensure  that  the  assets  of  the  County  are  protected 
from  loss,  theft,  or  misuse.    The  internal  control  structure  will  be  designed  to  provide 
reasonable assurance that these objectives are met.  Internal controls will be described in 
the County’s investment procedures manual.  

 
XIII.  DEPOSIT AND WITHDRAWAL OF FUNDS 
 

A.  Deposits:  Funds will be accepted at all times from those local agencies where the County 
Treasurer is also the Treasurer for the local agency, or from any agencies that by statute 
must place their money in the Treasury Pool.  The County Treasurer, in conjunction with 
the  Auditor,  shall  set  conditions  under  which  funds  from  local  agencies  not  required  to 
have  their  funds  in  the  Treasury  Pool  may  deposit  voluntarily  invested  funds.    Local 
agencies from outside the County will not be permitted to deposit funds in the Treasury 
Pool. 

 
B.  Withdrawals:  Under language added to the California Government Code in 1995, it is not 
permissible  for  local  agency  legislative  bodies,  required  to  have  their  funds  in  the 
Treasury  Pool,  to  withdraw  funds  in  order  to  invest  outside  the  Treasury  Pool.    Local 
agencies  within  the  County  who  voluntarily  participate  in  the  Treasury  Pool  may 
withdraw their funds under conditions set forth in California Government Code Section 
27136. 

   
XIV.

timetable for resolution; and, 

 
2.  A statement that the County has adequate funds to meet its cash flow requirements for 

the next six months. 

 
C.  Annual Reports:

GLOSSARY OF INVESTMENT TERMS 

FFCB.    The  Federal  Farm  Credit  Bank  System  provides  credit  and  liquidity  in  the 

 

FHLB.    The  Federal  Home  Loan  Bank  provides  credit  and  liquidity  in  the  housing 

 FDIC.    The  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  provides  insurance  backed  by  the 

Agencies.    Shorthand  market  terminology  for  any  obligation  issued  by  a  government-
sponsored  entity  (GSE),  or  a  federally  related  institution.    Most  obligations  of  GSEs  are  not 
guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the US government.  Examples are listed below.  
 
full faith and credit of the US government to certain bank deposits and debt obligations. 
 
agricultural industry.  FFCB issues discount notes and bonds.   
 
market.  FHLB issues discount notes  and bonds.   
FHLMC.    Like  FHLB,  the  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage  Corporation  provides  credit 
 
and liquidity in the housing market.   FHLMC,  also  called  “FreddieMac”  issues  discount  notes, 
bonds and mortgage pass-through securities.  
FNMA.    Like  FHLB  and  FreddieMac,  the  Federal  National  Mortgage  Association  was 
 
established  to  provide  credit  and  liquidity  in  the  housing  market.    FNMA,  also  known  as 
“FannieMae,” issues discount notes, bonds and mortgage pass-through securities.   
  
GNMA.    The  Government  National  Mortgage  Association,  known  as  “GinnieMae,” 
issues mortgage pass-through securities, which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the 
US Government.   
 
PEFCO are not guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the US government.   
TVA.  The Tennessee Valley Authority provides flood control and power and promotes 
 
development in portions of the Tennessee, Ohio and Mississippi River valleys.  TVA currently 
issues discount notes and bonds.   

PEFCO.    The  Private  Export  Funding  corporation  assists  exporters.    Obligations  of 

Asked.  The price at which a seller offers to sell a security. 
Asset Backed Securities.  Securities supported by pools of installment loans or leases or 

by pools of revolving lines of credit.    

Average  life.    In  mortgage-related  investments,  including  CMOs,  the  average  time  to 

expected receipt of principal payments, weighted by the amount of principal expected.  

Banker’s  acceptance.    A  money  market  instrument  created  to  facilitate  international 
trade  transactions.      It  is  highly  liquid  and  safe  because  the  risk  of  the  trade  transaction  is 
transferred to the bank which “accepts” the obligation to pay the investor.  

Benchmark.  A comparison security or portfolio.  A performance benchmark is a partial 

market index, which reflects the mix of securities allowed under a specific investment policy.  

Bid.  The price at which a buyer offers to buy a security.  
Broker.    A  broker  brings  buyers  and  sellers  together  for  a  transaction  for  which  the 

broker receives a commission.  A broker does not sell securities from his own position.  

Callable.  A callable security gives the issuer the option to call it from the investor prior 
to  its  maturity.    The  main  cause  of  a  call  is  a  decline  in  interest  rates.  If  interest  rates  decline 
since  an  issuer  issues  securities,  it  will  likely  call its  current  securities  and  reissue  them  at  a 
lower rate of interest. Callable securities have reinvestment risk as the investor may receive its 
principal back when interest rates are lower than when the investment was initially made. 

 

15

 

Certificate  of  Deposit  (CD).    A  time  deposit  with  a  specific  maturity  evidenced  by  a 

certificate.  Large denomination CDs may be marketable. 

Certificate  of  Deposit  Account  Registry  System  (CDARS).    A  private  placement 
service that allows local agencies to purchase more than $250,000 in CDs from a single financial 
institution  (must  be  a  participating  institutions  of  CDARS)  while  still  maintaining  FDIC 
insurance  coverage.    CDARS  are  currently  the  only  entity  providing  this  service.    CDARS 
facilitates  the  trading  of  deposits  between  the  California  institution  and  other  participating 
institutions in amounts that are less than $250,000 each, so that FDIC coverage is maintained.     

Collateral.    Securities  or  cash  pledged  by  a  borrower  to  secure  repayment  of  a  loan  or 
repurchase  agreement.    Also,  securities  pledged  by  a  financial  institution  to  secure  deposits  of 
public monies.  

Collateralized  Mortgage  Obligations  (CMO).    Classes  of  bonds  that  redistribute  the 
cash flows of mortgage securities (and whole loans) to create securities that have different levels 
of prepayment risk, as compared to the underlying mortgage securities.    

Commercial paper.  The short-term unsecured debt of corporations.  
Cost  yield.    The  annual  income  from  an  investment  divided  by  the  purchase  cost.  
Because it does not give effect to premiums and discounts which may have been included in the 
purchase cost, it is an incomplete measure of return.  

Coupon.  The rate of return at which interest is paid on a bond. 
Credit risk.  The risk that principal and/or interest on an investment will not be paid in a 

timely manner due to changes in the condition of the issuer.   

Current  yield.    The  annual  income  from  an  investment  divided  by  the  current  market 
value.    Since  the  mathematical  calculation  relies  on  the  current  market  value  rather  than  the 
investor’s cost, current yield is unrelated to the actual return the investor will earn if the security 
is held to maturity.     

Dealer.  A dealer acts as a principal in security transactions, selling securities from and 

buying securities for his own position.   

Debenture.  A bond secured only by the general credit of the issuer.   
Delivery  vs.  payment  (DVP).    A  securities  industry  procedure  whereby  payment  for  a 

security must be made at the time the security is delivered to the purchaser’s agent.     

Derivative. Any security that has principal and/or interest payments which are subject to 
uncertainty  (but  not  for  reasons  of  default  or  credit  risk)  as  to  timing  and/or  amount,  or  any 
security which represents a component of another security which has been separated from other 
components  (“Stripped”  coupons  and  principal).  A  derivative  is  also  defined  as  a  financial 
instrument the value of which is totally or partially derived from the value of another instrument, 
interest rate or index.    

Discount.  The difference between the par value of a bond and the cost of the bond, when 
the cost is below par.  Some short-term securities, such as T-bills and banker’s acceptances, are 
known as discount securities.  They sell at a discount from par, and return the par value to the 
investor at maturity without additional interest.  Other securities, which have fixed coupons trade 
at  a  discount  when  the  coupon  rate  is  lower  than  the  current  market  rate  for  securities  of  that 
maturity and/or quality.     

Diversification.    Dividing  investment  funds  among  a  variety  of  investments  to  avoid 

excessive exposure to any one source of risk.     

 

16

 

Duration.  The weighted average time to maturity of a bond  where the  weights are the 
present  values  of  the  future  cash  flows.    Duration  measures  the  price  sensitivity  of  a  bond  to 
changes in interest rates.  (See modified duration).    

Federal funds rate.  The rate of interest charged by banks for short-term loans to other 

banks.  The Federal Reserve Bank through open-market operations establishes it.

establishes  monetary  policy  and  executes  it  through  temporary  and  permanent  changes  to  the 
supply of bank reserves.   

Leverage.  Borrowing funds in order to invest in securities that have the potential to pay 

earnings at a rate higher than the cost of borrowing.  

Liquidity:  The speed and ease with which an asset can be converted to cash. 
Local  Agency  Investment  Fund  (LAIF).    A  voluntary  investment  fund  open  to 
government  entities  and  certain  non-profit  organizations  in  California  that  is  managed  by  the 
State Treasurer’s Office. 

Local  Government  Investment  Pool.    Investment  pools  that  range  from  the  State 
Treasurer’s  Office  Local  Agency  Investment  Fund  (LAIF)  to  county  pools,  to  Joint  Powers 
Authorities  (JPAs).    These  funds  are  not  subject  to  the  same  SEC  rules  applicable  to  money 
market mutual funds.   

Make Whole Call.  A type of call provision on a bond that allows the issuer to pay off 

the remaining debt early. Unlike a call option, with a make whole call provision, the issuer 
makes a lump sum payment that equals the net present value (NPV) of future coupon payments 
that will not be paid because of the call.  With this type of call, an investor is compensated, or 
"made whole."  

Margin:    The  difference  between  the  market  value  of  a  security  and  the  loan  a  broker 

makes using that security as   collateral.   

Market risk.  The risk that the value of securities will fluctuate with changes in overall 

market conditions or interest rates.  

Market value.  The price at which a security can be traded.   
Marking  to  market.    The  process  of  posting  current  market  values  for  securities  in  a 

portfolio.   

Maturity.  The  final  date  upon  which  the  principal  of  a  security  becomes  due  and 

payable.   

Medium  term  notes.    Unsecured,  investment-grade  senior  debt  securities  of  major 
corporations which are sold in relatively small amounts either on a continuous or an intermittent 
basis.  MTNs  are  highly  flexible  debt  instruments  that  can  be  structured  to  respond  to  market 
opportunities or to investor preferences.  

Modified duration.  The percent change in price for a 100 basis point change in yields. 
Modified  duration  is  the  best  single  measure  of  a  portfolio’s  or  security’s  exposure  to  market 
risk.   

Money market.  The market in which short term debt instruments (Tbills, discount notes, 

commercial paper and banker’s acceptances) are issued and traded.   

Mortgage  pass-through  securities.    A  securitized  participation  in  the  interest  and 
principal cashflows from a specified pool of mortgages.  Principal and interest payments made 
on the mortgages are passed through to the holder of the security.  

Mutual fund.  An entity which pools the funds of investors and invests those funds in a 
set  of  securities  which  is  specifically  defined  in  the  fund’s  prospectus.    Mutual  funds  can  be 

 

17

 

invested  in  various  types  of  domestic  and/or  international  stocks,  bonds  and  money  market 
instruments,  as  set  forth  in  the  individual  fund’s  prospectus.    For  most  large,  institutional 
investors,  the  costs  associated  with  investing  in  mutual  funds  are  higher  than  the  investor  can 
obtain through an individually managed portfolio.  

Negotiable CD.  A short-term debt instrument that pays interest and is issued by a bank, 
savings or federal association, state or federal credit union, or state-licensed branch of a foreign 
bank.  Negotiable CDs are traded in a secondary market and are payable upon order to the bearer 
or initial depositor (investor). 

Premium. The difference between the par value of a bond and the cost of the bond, when 

the cost is above par.  

Prepayment  speed.    A  measure  of  how  quickly  principal  is  repaid  to  investors  in 

mortgage securities.  

Prepayment window.  The time period over which principal repayments will be received 

on mortgage securities at a specified prepayment speed.  

Primary dealer.  A financial institution (1) that is a trading counterparty with the Federal 
Reserve  in  its  execution  of  market  operations  to  carry  out  U.S.  monetary  policy,  and  (2)  that 
participates  for  statistical  reporting  purposes  in  compiling  data  on  activity  in  the  U.S. 
Government securities market.  

Prudent person (man) rule.   A standard of responsibility which applies to fiduciaries.  
In California, the rule is stated as “Investments shall be managed with the care, skill, prudence 
and  diligence,  under  the  circumstances  then  prevailing,  that  a  prudent  person,  acting  in  a  like 
capacity  and  familiar  with  such  matters,  would  use  in  the  conduct  of  an  enterprise  of  like 
character and with like aims to accomplish similar purposes.”  

Realized yield.  The change in value of the portfolio due to interest received and interest 
earned  and  realized  gains  and  losses.    It  does  not  give  effect  to  changes  in  market  value  on 
securities, which have not been sold from the portfolio.   

Regional dealer.  A financial intermediary that buys and sells securities for the benefit of 
its customers without maintaining substantial inventories of securities, and that is not a primary 
dealer.  

Repurchase  agreement  (RP,  Repo).    Short  term  purchases  of  securities  with  a 
simultaneous agreement to sell the securities back at a higher price.  From the seller’s point of 
view, the same transaction is a reverse repurchase agreement.   

Safekeeping.  A service to bank customers whereby securities are held by the bank in the 

customer’s name.   

Structured note.  A complex, fixed income instrument, which pays interest, based on a 
formula  tied  to  other  interest  rates,  commodities  or  indices.  Examples  include  inverse  floating 
rate notes which have coupons that increase when other interest rates are falling, and which fall 
when  other  interest  rates  are  rising,  and  "dual  index  floaters,"  which  pay  interest  based  on  the 
relationship  between  two  other  interest  rates  -  for  example,  the  yield  on  the  ten-year  Treasury 
note  minus  the  Libor  rate.    Issuers  of  such  notes  lock  in  a  reduced  cost  of  borrowing  by 
purchasing interest rate swap agreements. 

Supranational.  A Supranational is a multi-national organization whereby member states 
transcend  national  boundaries  or  interest  to  share  in  the  decision  making  to  promote  economic 
development in the member countries.   

 

18

 

Total rate of return.  A measure of a portfolio’ performance over time.  It is the internal 
rate  of  return,  which  equates  the  beginning  value  of  the  portfolio  with  the  ending  value;  it 
includes interest earnings, realized and unrealized gains, and losses in the portfolio.   

U.S.  Treasury  obligations.    Securities  issued  by  the  U.S.  Treasury  and  backed  by  the 
full faith and credit of the United States.  Treasuries are considered to have no credit risk, and are 
the  benchmark  for  interest  rates  on  all  other  securities  in  the  US  and  overseas.    The  Treasury 
issues both discounted securities and fixed coupon notes and bonds.   
Treasury bills.  All securities issued with initial maturities of one year or less are issued 
 
as  discounted  instruments,  and  are  called  Treasury  bills.    The  Treasury  currently  issues  three- 
and  six-month  T-bills  at  regular  weekly  auctions.    It  also  issues  “cash  management”  bills  as 
needed to smooth out cash flows.     
 
Treasury notes, and pay interest semi-annually.  
 
called Treasury bonds.  Like  Treasury notes, they pay interest semi-annually.   

Treasury  bonds.    All securities  issued  with  initial  maturities  greater  than  ten  years  are 

Treasury notes.  All securities issued with initial maturities of two to ten years are called 

Volatility.    The  rate  at  which  security  prices  change  with  changes  in  general  economic 

conditions or the general level of interest rates.  

Yield  to  Maturity.    The  annualized  internal  rate  of  return  on  an  investment  which 

equates the expected cash flows from the investment to its cost.

deemed  received  on  a given  Business  Day  if  it  is  received  prior  to  1:00 p.m.  (New  York  time)  on  such
Business  Day;  otherwise,  it  will  be  deemed  received  on  the  next  Business  Day.    If  any  Notice  of
Nonpayment received by AGM  is incomplete,  it  shall be deemed not to have been received by AGM for
purposes  of  the  preceding  sentence  and  AGM  shall  promptly  so  advise  the  Trustee,  Paying  Agent  or
Owner,  as  appropriate,  who  may  submit  an  amended  Notice  of  Nonpayment.    Upon  disbursement  in
respect of a Bond, AGM shall become the owner of the Bond, any appurtenant coupon to the Bond or right
to receipt of payment of principal of or interest on the Bond and shall be fully subrogated to the rights of the
Owner, including the Owner's right to receive payments under the Bond, to the extent of any payment by
AGM hereunder.  Payment by AGM to the Trustee or Paying Agent for the benefit of the Owners shall, to
the extent thereof, discharge the obligation of AGM under this Policy.

 
Except to the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, the following terms shall have
the meanings specified  for all  purposes of this Policy.    "Business  Day"  means  any  day  other  than (a)  a
Saturday  or Sunday  or (b)  a day  on  which banking  institutions  in  the State of New  York or  the  Insurer's
Fiscal  Agent  are authorized  or  required by  law or  executive order to remain closed.   "Due  for  Payment"
means (a) when referring to the principal of a Bond, payable on the stated maturity date thereof or the date
on which the same shall have been duly called for mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to
any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking
fund  redemption),  acceleration  or  other  advancement  of  maturity  unless  AGM  shall  elect,  in  its  sole
discretion, to pay such principal due upon such acceleration together with any accrued interest to the date
of  acceleration  and  (b) when referring to  interest on  a Bond, payable  on the stated date  for payment  of
interest.  "Nonpayment" means, in  respect of a Bond, the failure of the Issuer to have provided sufficient
funds to the Trustee or, if there is no Trustee, to the Paying Agent for payment in full of all principal and
interest that is Due for Payment on such Bond.  "Nonpayment" shall also include, in respect of a Bond, any
payment of principal or interest that is Due for Payment made to an Owner by or on behalf of the Issuer

United States Bankruptcy Code by a trustee in bankruptcy in accordance with a final, nonappealable order
of  a  court  having  competent  jurisdiction.    "Notice"  means  telephonic  or  telecopied  notice,  subsequently
confirmed in a signed writing, or written notice by registered or certified mail, from an Owner, the Trustee or
the Paying Agent to AGM which notice shall specify (a) the person or entity making the claim, (b) the Policy
Number, (c) the claimed amount and (d) the date such claimed amount became Due for Payment.  "Owner"
means, in respect of a Bond, the person or entity who, at the time of Nonpayment, is entitled under the
terms of such Bond to payment thereof, except that "Owner" shall not include the Issuer or any person or
entity whose direct or indirect obligation constitutes the underlying security for the Bonds.

 
AGM  may  appoint  a  fiscal  agent  (the  "Insurer's  Fiscal  Agent")  for  purposes  of  this  Policy  by
giving written notice to the Trustee and the Paying Agent specifying  the name and notice address of  the
Insurer's Fiscal Agent.  From and after the date of receipt of such notice by the Trustee and the Paying
Agent,  (a)  copies  of  all  notices  required  to  be  delivered  to  AGM  pursuant  to  this  Policy  shall  be
simultaneously delivered to the Insurer's Fiscal Agent and to AGM and shall not be deemed received until
received by both and (b) all payments required to be made by AGM under this Policy may be made directly
by AGM or by the Insurer's Fiscal Agent on behalf of AGM.  The Insurer's Fiscal Agent is the agent of AGM
only and the Insurer's Fiscal Agent shall in no event be liable to any Owner for any act of the Insurer's Fiscal
Agent or any failure of AGM to deposit or cause to be deposited sufficient funds to make payments due
under this Policy.

 
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, AGM agrees not to assert, and hereby waives,
only for the benefit of each Owner, all rights (whether by counterclaim, setoff or otherwise) and defenses
(including,  without  limitation,  the  defense  of  fraud),  whether  acquired  by  subrogation,  assignment  or
otherwise,  to  the extent that such rights and defenses may be available  to AGM to  avoid  payment of its
obligations under this Policy in accordance with the express provisions of this Policy.

 
This  Policy  sets  forth  in  full  the  undertaking  of  AGM,  and  shall  not  be  modified,  altered  or
affected by any other agreement or instrument, including any modification or amendment thereto.  Except to
the extent expressly modified by an endorsement hereto, (a) any premium paid in respect of this Policy is
nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever, including payment, or provision being made for payment, of the
Bonds  prior  to  maturity  and  (b)  this  Policy  may  not  be  canceled  or  revoked.      THIS  POLICY  IS  NOT
COVERED BY THE PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE SECURITY FUND SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 76
OF THE NEW YORK INSURANCE LAW.
